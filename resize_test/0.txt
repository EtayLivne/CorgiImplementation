People like Arlen Specter who denied later said I shouldn’t have denied it and said I served with him and found for him to be egalitarian.
CUOMO: Wouldn’t it be easier for him to come out and say, this stuff about me about joking about the KKK  —   CONWAY: He has said that.
CUOMO:  —   that’s nonsense.
I believe the NAACP is a good organization.
I believe the Voting Rights Act is an important law as the attorney general to enforce  —   CONWAY: He voted got all types of civil rights extensions.
CUOMO: He has been actively against that act for a long time.
CONWAY: You have to look at the full measure of the man.
And I know people who don’t want to respect the election results whoever they are out there  —   CUOMO: I think that’s an excuse, Kellyanne.
CONWAY:  —   are still in campaign mode.
They’re still in campaign mode.
CUOMO: Attorney general, your choice, he’s actively against the vote.
CONWAY: Why didn’t Democrats put anybody up against him last time he ran in 2014?
CUOMO: In Alabama?
CONWAY: Sure.
If you’re against him, be the sacrificial lamb.
Say I’m going to stop this guy because of who he is.
They couldn’t do it because hey’re looking at the full record.
He’s been the United States senator for 20 years He was a law enforcement officer before that.
He is incredibly qualified.
Look, the criteria for any of these posts, Chris  —   number one, are you qualified and capable of doing the job on day one?
Secondly, are you loyal to the agenda that the   has put forward as his vision?
And he has a right to go ahead and implement that with the advisers that he surrounds himself with.
That’s what confirmation hearings are for.
And I would hope someone would extend senatorial courtesy to someone they worked with and who they know in fullness.
There are some pundits out there saying his name should be rescinded because they have no place in saying  —   CUOMO: That’s an opinion.
I’m just asking about the facts of their service.
CONWAY: I’m giving you many of them.
CUOMO:  I’m happy to put them right where you are, anytime he wants.

American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) attorney Chase Strangio took to Twitter to castigate Christians for the shooting massacre by jihadist Omar Mateen at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida.

Rho said they were promoting the “extreme,   First Amendment Defense Act.
” The ACLU itself released the following statement after the shooting: We stand in solidarity with the LGBT community, which appears to have been the target of this attack.
Our thoughts are with those who lost loved ones and with the entire suffering Central Florida community.
As we come together to heal from this tragedy, we must also continue to stand against any reaction to this horrific event that is rooted in hatred or bigotry in any form.
We remain in solidarity with the Muslim community here in Florida and elsewhere.
The Muslim Students Association of North America similarly attempted to boost its alliance with fellow minority LGBT activists by claiming in its statement that the shooting was an “act of homophobia” and a “hate crime” similar to what Muslims experience due to “Islamophobia.
” Other leftwing organizations such as Planned Parenthood and other feminist groups are also attempting to shore up their alliances with Muslims and LGBT groups in the wake of the shooting massacre.
We stand in solidarity against acts of terrorism  hatred towards individuals because of who they are or who they love.

Broward County, Florida’s Supervisor of Elections Office (SOE) has recently come under fire for multiple allegations of voter fraud, including the improper handling of absentee ballots and an accusation that SOE employees were secretly filling out piles of blank ballots in a back room.
[The voter fraud allegations in Broward County, Fla. continued today, as this morning a sworn affidavit was released stating dozens of   or mentally incapacitated voters have had their ballots effectively filled out by individuals claiming to assist them.
Florida Republican operative Lauren Cooley first broke the story on Twitter earlier today.
The affiant is a poll watcher, certified by the Broward County Supervisor of Elections, and states that these incidents have been ongoing at the North West Regional Library polling location in Coral Springs, Fla. since early voting began on Oct. 24.
Per voting laws, assisting a voter who is mentally or physically incapable of filling out their own ballot is limited to reading off the ballot language and receiving a form of confirmation from the voter before taking action to fill in the ballot.
Furthermore, this interaction must be witnessed by two poll workers.
These measures were never enforced as dozens of mentally ill voters had their ballots filled out on their behalf without interaction between the assistor and the voter and without oversight from poll workers, according to the affiant.
Cooley spoke at length with the NW Regional Library’s registered poll watcher and the voting location clerk, who this reporter identified as Claire Dunn of Coral Springs.
According to Cooley, Dunn is exasperated with the entire process and will not return to her post next election cycle.
“We call Brenda Snipes’ office and they don’t care.
They say let everybody vote.
Let everybody vote.
So we do,” Dunn told Cooley.
“They don’t want any attention brought to them, any legal trouble,” she continued.
One incident detailed in the affidavit describes a man filling out a ballot on behalf of a woman who was not physically capable of filling out her own ballot.
When the man completed his own ballot, he proceeded to fill out the woman’s ballot without any interaction or form of consent.
She sat alone in an adjacent booth, showing signs of physical discomfort, with her arms wrapped around herself and rocking    per the sworn affidavit.
The woman then attempted to insert her ballot into an optical scanner and was ultimately unable to do so herself.
A poll worker inserted the ballot for her.
Upon seeing the incident, Dunn called an official SOE office and was simply told “Everyone will vote.
” No further action was made to address these accounts of voter fraud, despite the registered poll watchers many attempts to alert the Broward SOE.
“These people are infirmed, if you know what I’m saying, they sit in their wheelchairs and stare straight ahead while their ‘assistor’ effectively marks their ballot,” the affiant told this reporter.
The poll watcher continued by saying this was an ongoing issue, “[the voter fraud] is happening several times a day by multiple groups of people  —   this isn’t a one time thing and it’s a third degree felony in the state of Florida.
” “These people even pulled up in a school bus, brought out a mentally ill person, had him vote and then walked out while making smartass comments about Trump,” he added.
Multiple other accounts of voter fraud were documented in the affidavit signed by the Broward County, Fla. poll watcher.
In his own words, “[the voter fraud] became too much to document and seemed pointless since the poll workers were not allowed to stop the fraud even though it was to spot.
” Adding, “what I witnessed was an abuse of the elderly and infirmed in Broward for the purpose of Elections Fraud relative individuals marking ballots that were not their own.
” I reached out to the Broward County, Fla.
Supervisor of Elections Office for comment and their official statement was, “there is no such thing going on.
”
RIO DE JANEIRO (AP)  —   Michael Phelps closed out the Rio Olympics in the only way imaginable.
[Golden.
Phelps put the United States ahead to stay on the butterfly leg of the 4×100 medley relay and Nathan Adrian finished it off, giving the most decorated athlete in Olympic history his 23rd career gold medal.
If that was the end, and Phelps insists it is, what a way to go out.
He would finish his career with 28 medals overall, having won five golds and a silver at these games.
gold medalist Ryan Murphy put the Americans out front with a   split on the backstroke  —   it counts since he was leading off  —   but Britain surged ahead on the breaststroke with its own   holder, Adam Peaty.
Phelps dove into the pool in second place.
He wouldn’t be for long.
On the return lap, Phelps powered through the water with his whirling butterfly stroke, surging ahead of James Guy to pass off a lead to the anchor Adrian.
It wasn’t in doubt after that.
Adrian pulled away on the freestyle to win in an   time of 3 minutes, 27.
95 seconds.
Britain held on for silver, with Australia nabbing bronze.
The victory came just minutes after the women’s medley relay gave the United States its 1, 000th Olympic gold medal at the Summer Games.
Kathleen Baker, Lilly King, Dana Vollmer and Simone Manuel led the American triumph.
The winning time was 3:53.
13.
Australia earned silver, while Denmark took bronze.
For Manuel, it was her second medal of the night  —   she also won silver in the 50 free  —   and second gold of the games.
She became the first   woman to win an Olympic swimming title with her win in the 100 free.
Connor Jaeger gave the U. S. another silver in the 1, 500 free, leaving the American with 33 swimming medals in Rio  —   matching the highest total since the boycotted Los Angeles Games in 1984.
The U. S. also won 33 medals at Sydney in 2000.
The final two individual medals of the games went to Pernille Blume of Denmark in the 50 freestyle, her country’s first swimming gold since 1948, and Italy’s Gregorio Paltrinieri in the grueling 1, 500 free.
After posting the top time in both the preliminaries and the semifinals, Blume came through again on the final night of swimming at the Rio Games.
She finished in 24.
07.
After her landmark victory in the 100 free, Manuel settled for silver this time in 24.
09.
Aliaksandra Herasimenia of Belarus earned the bronze in 24.
11.
It was another huge disappointment for sisters Cate and Bronte Campbell of Australia.
They were shut out of an individual medal again, with Cate finishing fifth and Bronte seventh.
Blume was the third Danish swimmer to capture a gold.
Greta Andersen won the 100 free and Karen Margrethe Harup took the 100 backstroke at the 1948 London Olympics.
Paltrinieri pulled away from the field and was under   pace much of the race before fading a bit at the end.
Still, he won comfortably in 14:34.
57.
Jaeger claimed silver in 14:39.
48, while bronze went to another Italian, Gabriele Detti, in 14:40.
86.
Detti rallied over the final laps to pass American Jordan Wilimovksy, who settled for fourth.
Wilimovksy will get another shot at a medal in an even more demanding event  —   the   open water race at Fort Copacabana on Tuesday.

JANESVILLE, WI  —   House Speaker Paul Ryan received a standing ovation from wealthy donors after denouncing the views of Republican voters, who are skeptical of   “free trade” deals.
[Speaking at a lavish retreat for 400 donors hosted by a network helmed by libertarian billionaires Charles and David Koch, Paul Ryan suggested it was incumbent upon the Party to “repudiate” the views of Republican voters, who do not support Ryan and his donors’ trade agenda.
Ryan reportedly assured donors that he will work to “win some of these fights” and advance their agenda on trade  —   presumably meaning that Ryan plans to push through the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement, supported by GOP donors.
The Washington Post reports that Ryan’s message was warmly received by those in attendance at the elite retreat  —   noting that Ryan was “clearly a favorite” amongst the network of donors: The House speaker is clearly a favorite of the Koch donor network, and he was received with a standing ovation and whoops.
The audience interrupted him several times with hearty applause.
Echoing the sentiment of Washington conservatives such as talk radio host Mark Levin, Ryan expressed his concern to donors that the Republican Party has been taken over by progressive populists, who fail to understand the benefits of multinational “free trade” deals.
Ryan told donors that the views of these voters must be “repudiated.
” “We are flirting with various forms of progressivism, and there are Republican forms of progressivism.
Teddy Roosevelt was a Republican,” Ryan said.
“We have to thoroughly debunk it, repudiate it.
” Indeed, Mark Levin has similarly explained, “What I see developing is not a conservative coalition, but a coalition on the Republican side of big government advocates.
” “The Republican Party now is a party of the progressive Republicans.
Theodore Roosevelt  …     the protectionists, Ross Perot, Pat Buchanan, the ” Levin has said.
Ryan reportedly suggested that the GOP is engaged in the “fight for the soul of our party and for our country” over the issue of international trade.
Indeed, on this issue, Trump and the Republican electorate who support him find themselves opposed by Republican leadership, Republican donors, and professional Republicans like Mark Levin.
As Time writes: Trump won the Republican nomination by railing against trade deals and promising that manufacturing jobs would return if only better international agreements were written.
Frustrated voters flocked to Trump and his vague notions.
This network of Koch allies, known formally as Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, watched in horror.
Ryan seemed to assure donors that Washington Republicans would fight to advance their shared agenda: “We’ve got to win some of these fights in Washington on behalf of the   system.
We have our work cut out for us.
” The Washington Post seemed to suggest that Ryan will fight Trump’s plan to implement better trade deals for American workers: Ryan touted the importance of free trade, an issue Trump has railed against, and said it was essential that party leaders make a better case for the free market.
Trump argues that free trade agreements have hurt American workers, and that better deals are needed.
Time reported that “speaking on the thorny issue of trade,” Ryan noted that “we’re having a hard time with our party these days.
” “We have a different kind of nominee now.
It’s unique,” Ryan said.
Ryan’s primary challenger, Wisconsin businessman Paul Nehlen, has warned that Ryan will sabotage and “thwart President Trump at every opportunity.
” In particular, Nehlen has said if Ryan is sent back to Washington, he will “ram through the   Trans Pacific Partnership right after the election”  —   a deal which Donald Trump adamantly opposes.
Polling data shows that Republican voters are the group most skeptical of globalist trade policies  —   a fact that has gone unrecognized by Party leaders and professional Republicans.
Pew found that only a vanishing 11 percent of Republican voters believe that   “ ” will raise wages.
By a nearly    margin, Republican voters believe that   “free trade” depresses wages, rather than increases wages, and by a greater than    margin, Republican voters believe that “free trade” will kill jobs, not create them.
Yet despite polling data, Republican Party leaders worked tirelessly to give President Obama expanded trade powers.
In 2015, Ryan acted as President Obama’s “partner” in his effort to fast track the   Partnership (TPP).
In a 2015 Wall Street Journal   Ryan described the TPP as a “historic” agreement, which “would mean greater access to a billion customers for American manufacturers, farmers, and ranchers.
” Ryan was the leading champion for fast tracking the TPP even though Wisconsin suffered a net loss of nearly 40, 000 jobs in 2015 alone due to the U. S. trade deficit with TPP countries, according to the Economic Policy Institute.
In his open primary on August 9th, Ryan will likely face some of the very voters whose views Ryan believes the GOP needs to “repudiate.
” According to exit polling data, a majority of GOP Wisconsin voters believe foreign trade deals “take away” jobs.
Nehlen, who opposes the Trans Pacific Partnership agreement, has warned that Ryan’s trade agenda “will be the fundamental undoing of America.
” Nehlen has warned that the TPP would be “worse than NAFTA.
It sets up a   organization similar to the European Union.
We know all too well what the European Union is doing right now, and we don’t want that to happen here.
” This “massive,   international ‘trade’ deal,” Nehlen writes, “sells out American workers.
It sells out American business and industry.
It will kill the economy in this district, never mind the rest of the country.
” Nehlen has previously said that Ryan’s support for these multinational trade deals seems to stem from Ryan’s ties to globalist donors, such as the donors whom Ryan presumably spoke to at the Koch Brothers retreat  —   although, as the Washington Post reports, the complete list of donors Ryan spoke to at the event is not available to the public.
“News outlets were invited to cover portions of the Koch seminar, on the condition that they did not name donors in attendance without their permission,” the Washington Post writes.
Nehlen said: “Paul Ryan isn’t representing our district.
He’s representing the big businesses and big banks that pour money into his campaign coffers.
It’s their agendas he’s carrying forward with his votes in Congress  …     not ours.
” Ryan’s remarks at the Koch Brothers retreat come on the heels of new reports indicating that the Koch Brothers are refusing to run negative ads against Hillary Clinton  —   which some have suggested will only help the success of Hillary Clinton’s candidacy.
Ryan’s remarks also come in the immediate aftermath of his decision to join in on Clinton’s latest attacks against his Party’s nominee.
Ryan’s recent statements and actions, which seem designed to undermine the GOP nominee, have led some to speculate that Ryan might perhaps prefer to see Hillary Clinton in the White House than Donald Trump.
Indeed, several reports have documented that Ryan would likely accomplish more of his legislative goals on foreign trade, foreign migration, and foreign wars if Hillary Clinton were president than if Donald Trump were.
Should Ryan win his   and Trump lose, it is likely that  —   as Tim Kaine has predicted  —   amnesty will be enacted within the first 100 days, the TPP will be implemented, and criminal sentencing laws will be reduced, potentially resulting in an increase in the amount of violent crime and recidivism in U. S. communities.
All of these policies are supported by Paul Ryan, the Koch brothers, and the globalist special interests who fund both the Clinton campaign and Ryan.
Listen to Julia Hahn’s discussion of this article on Breitbart News Daily on SiriusXM:
CLEVELAND, Ohio  —   At least one top talent inside Fox News has confirmed to Breitbart News that a major talent meeting among various different hosts is scheduled, and they are considering leaving with Roger Ailes to form a new network to compete with Fox.
[“Everyone here hates Gretchen and Megyn,” the talent said in a brief phone interview, adding that hosts from Fox and Friends and throughout the primetime lineup from the   of The Five to Special Report’s Bret Baier to Greta Van Susteren to Bill O’Reilly, Shepard Smith and Sean Hannity are planning to band together and potentially execute contract clauses that allow them to leave if Ailes is driven out.
That being said, if this group —  Baier, Hannity, Van Susteren, Smith and O’Reilly —  can stick together and effectively negotiate as a bloc with whatever other resources and talent they have, they could strap together enough leverage to block Kelly.
But that shows how powerful Kelly has become inside a network where most of her colleagues despise her.
Ailes has come under fire amid unsubstantiated allegations from Gretchen Carlson, the former Fox anchor, and now Megyn Kelly of The Kelly File that he allegedly sexually harassed them.
The only host whom this talent hasn’t personally confirmed as part of a potential mass exodus was O’Reilly.
But since Ailes bailed out O’Reilly when he came under fire for a loofah incident that even he would “consider” leaving in a mass exodus.
“Fox can have Megyn,” the talent said.
“We want Roger.
” The Financial Times confirmed the possibility of a mass Fox News exodus in its reporting.
“Three of Fox News’ biggest stars  —   Bill O’Reilly, Sean Hannity and Greta Van Susteren  —   have clauses in their contracts that would allow them to depart if Mr Ailes were to leave the network, the two people briefed on the dispute said,” the Financial Times wrote.
“This means a core team of   talent could follow Mr Ailes out of the door.
” This talent added that there is a lot expected to come out about how much Kelly’s colleagues despise her.
“The entire building hates her,” the source said.
“Nobody cares that she’s upset about a frickin’ hug.
” Specifically, Kelly’s supposed sexual harassment allegation against Ailes was due to a hug in 2006 she didn’t like, according to The Drudge Report.
The Drudge Report has also reported on this meeting, but Gabriel Sherman of New York Magazine —  an   agitator in the media —  claims it is not true.
Drudge headline is Ailes spin attempt at spin, Fox source in Cleveland says talent has not set meeting to stage walk out.
”Absolutely not”  —   Gabriel Sherman (@gabrielsherman) July 19, 2016,  But, at least one of the anchors who would be in such a meeting has confirmed to Breitbart News that Sherman is wrong —  and that the meeting will take place.
If Ailes were to be driven out by Rupert Murdoch and his sons, then there is already talk among the remaining anchors about getting together a new network outside of Fox News after everyone of the other anchors executes their contract clauses that allow them to leave if Ailes is gone.
None of this, of course, is certain and ultimately things may change quickly.
But the fact there’s even discussion among top talent at the network of the creation of a new network designed to compete with a Megyn   Fox News is remarkable.
From the BBC:[He told a rally in Indiana that China was responsible for “the greatest theft in the history of the world”.
Mr Trump, a billionaire businessman, has long accused China of manipulating its currency to make its exports more competitive globally.
This, he says, has badly damaged US businesses and workers.
“We can’t continue to allow China to rape our country, and that’s what we’re doing,” he told the campaign rally on Sunday.
“We’re going to turn it around, and we have the cards, don’t forget it,” he added.
“We have a lot of power with China.
” Mr Trump, in his campaign manifesto, pledges to “cut a better deal with China that helps American businesses and workers compete”.
He sets out four goals that include immediately declaring China “a currency manipulator” and putting “an end to China’s illegal export subsidies and lax labour and environmental standards”.
Latest figures from the US government show the trade deficit with China reached an   high of $365.
7bn (£250.
1bn) last year.
By February this year, it had already reached $57bn.
There was no immediate response from Beijing to Mr Trump’s comments, but he is seen by many in China as an inspiration rather than an antagonist, says the BBC’s Vincent Ni.
Donald Trump has repeatedly accused China of manipulating its currency to make its exports more competitive, with what he says are damaging consequences for the US economy.
Rather than floating freely against the dollar, the Chinese authorities ensure the yuan maintains a closely fixed relationship with the US currency, and that it only trades in a narrow band either side of a fixed point selected by China.
Critics, including Mr Trump, claim China is keeping its currency at an unnaturally low level to boost its exports to the US, which also damages the prospects of US firms selling their goods to China.
That, they say, has created in a huge trade imbalance.
Latest figures from Washington for   goods trade in January and February show the relationship does appear to be skewed.
In those months the US exported $16.
3bn in goods to China, but imported $73.
3bn, leaving a massive goods trade imbalance of $57bn.
Last week, the US Treasury placed China (and others) on a currency watchlist, after pressure on the US government to be more robust in combating any currency manipulation by trading partners.
The Treasury stated that none of its large trading partners had engaged in currency manipulation in the past year, but indicated it was concerned about growing imbalances with some of those partners, including China.

Some members of the Iraqi Christian minority community are seeking to establish an autonomous territory in their historical homeland in northern Iraq’s Nineveh Plain region after the city of Mosul is liberated from the Islamic State ( ) and the jihadist group is defeated, reports  .
[“We cannot live as we used to live until [ISIS] is eliminated and Mosul is declared liberated,” Dr. Soory Maqdassy, an Iraqi Christian, told the Washington, D. C.  publication.
“We must have an autonomous region in the Nineveh Plain, in the north and south of it.
”  “Iraq is constructed on Shiite, Sunni and Kurdish components, and the product of it has become the cleansing of our population from the Nineveh Plain with the arrival of Daesh [ISIS] and the declaration of the Islamic state,” he added.
“We cannot trust Baghdad or [Iraqi Kurdistan capital] Erbil anymore.
We need to have an autonomous region in the Nineveh Plain, after the liberation of Mosul.
” Sami Supania, another Iraqi Christian, “was nodding to every word Maqdassy uttered as if to emphasize once again the common position of the Christian minority of Iraq,” notes  .
In September, Rep. Jeff Fortenberry ( ) who led the effort to persuade his fellow lawmakers to officially recognize the ISIS atrocities against Christians and other minorities as genocide, introduced a bipartisan resolution to establish a province in the Nineveh Plain for Christians and the other indigenous people of the region.
The resolution “follows on the government of Iraq’s own initiative to create a province in the Nineveh Plain region, with the goal of restoring the ancestral homeland of so many suffering peoples.
The European Parliament last week passed a similar resolution,” he told Breitbart News this week.
Joe Rosenberg, a bestselling author and Middle East expert, explains that the Iraqi government has expressed a desire to create a new province that would include the Nineveh Plain and “would specifically serve as a safe haven for Iraqi Christians, Yazidis and other minorities.
” ISIS’ defeat in and around the Christian lands in northern Iraq appears imminent.
The World Watch Monitor (WWM) an organization that covers Christian persecution across the globe, reports that the Cross, described as a “symbol of Christ’s victory over evil,” has returned to the Christian villages in the Nineveh Plain after ISIS banned it.
“There were tears, soldiers praying, priests singing.
This was the moment thousands of Iraqi Christians had been waiting for,” adds WWM.
A U. S.  force of tens of thousands of Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) Kurdish Peshmerga troops, Sunni tribesmen, Christian fighters, and Shiite militiamen, many backed by Iran, are participating in an offensive to liberate Mosul from ISIS, which started on October 17.
The advancing U. S.  Iraqi force and their allies have reportedly liberated many Christian districts and villages in Iraq.
“As soon as it was remotely safe, the priests got into a car and were escorted back to their villages.
In Christian villages like Karamles and Qaraqosh  —   half an hour’s drive east of Mosul  —   they were among the first   to return now [that] the villages have been liberated from IS occupation,” reports WWM.
Earlier this week, Breitbart News learned that political and religious leaders from the Chaldean Syriac Assyrian community in Iraq have agreed to integrate all their Christian militias under the same leadership in an effort to completely seize and secure their homeland, the Nineveh Plain, located outside Mosul in the northern Iraqi province of Nineveh.
ISIS jihadists conquered the Nineveh Plain and the Christian lands surrounding it when it stormed Iraq in 2014.
Christians in the country, along with other   minority groups, have since been victims of genocide at the hands of the terrorist group.
Tens of thousands of Christians have been displaced.
Nineveh province was once home to the largest concentration of Christians and other   minorities in Iraq, such as the Yazidis.
Mosul, also located in the province, was once considered the heartland of the Iraqi Christian community.
Although the Christians are not the only indigenous people of the Nineveh Plain, they are one of the oldest.
“The Nineveh Plain, south and north, has been an extraordinary region for all the minority faiths only to be found on the territory of Iraq, from Christians to Sabians, from Shabeks to Yazidis,” Dr. Maqdassy told  .
“They lived in coexistence throughout history.
However, unfortunately, after 2003  —   the   liberation of Iraq  —   both the Baghdad central government and the Kurdish government in Erbil overlooked and undermined us and did not respect minority rights.
”
(Reuters)  —   French police officials said on Monday a man had opened fire near a supermarket west of Paris and injured two people.
[Elite police were at a building where a suspect was holed up, the officials said.
According to BFM TV the man was known to police for violent behaviour.

Just when you thought the media could not get any more dishonest and unserious, along comes Lester Holt.
[Yeah, the guy blundered through Monday night’s debate getting his “fact checks” wrong with Donald Trump and letting Hillary Clinton skate along on her river of lies.
And, yeah, the guy interrupted Mr. Trump seven times as much as he interrupted Mrs. Clinton.
And, yeah, he asked far more probing   questions of Mr. Trump and seemed to only shut down any lines of inquiry into Mrs. Clinton that opened up.
But all that is just typical partisan noise we have come to expect from the leftwing media.
None of these transgressions reveal just how cravenly dishonest and lazy and willfully   Lester the Media Molester and his compatriots have become in reporting on this election.
The cabal of shameless hacks skidded to a whole new low with this canard about Mr. Trump’s initial support for the war in Iraq.
“Not only that, you named the day!” Mr. Trump said incredulously.
“They couldn’t believe it.
They sat back and said, I can’t believe it!” Frantic to deflect the debate away from her own sordid record, Mrs. Clinton tapped the canvas for the ref to break it up and change the subject.
“Lester, we’ve covered  —   We’ve covered this ground,” she squealed.
Mr. Trump   through for a moment talking about how ISIS has since spread into 30 countries, slaughtering innocents and mutilating women and children.
But Lester the Media Molester had received his instructions and quickly swung into action to save his damsel in distress.
“Mr.
Trump, a lot of these are judgement questions.
You had supported the war in Iraq before the invasion.
What makes your —  ” Mr. Trump protested that he did not support the war, calling it “mainstream media nonsense.
” Fitting the bill, the Media Molester carried on.
“Since you supported it  …    ” Mr. Trump again protested and the Molester went on to interrupt him five more times and ultimately succeeded in changing the subject from Mrs. Clinton’s record.
It is true, there is ample evidence that Mr. Trump as a private citizen voiced opposition to the war in Iraq when it was launched.
The only evidence Mr. Holt and the lyin’ media can dig up to prove otherwise is a September 2002 interview with radio shock jock Howard Stern in which Mr. Trump is asked a series of quick unrelated questions until he is uncharacteristically stumped.
“Are you for invading Iraq?” Mr. Stern asks him.
“Yeah,” Mr. Trump responds unsteadily.
“I      so.
Uh, you know, I wish it was  —   I wish the first time it was done correctly.
” And then off to the next question about an entirely different topic.
Now, mind you, Mr. Stern’s question on Iraq comes shortly after this serious query: “Probably the most important question I could ask you on a day like today is, ‘Where is Melania and is she naked?
’” Yes, we are talking serious Senate debate here.
But you know what Lester the Media Molester failed to ask about during the   debate?
He failed to ask one single question about Mrs. Clinton’s judgement regarding her long, twisted history with the Iraq invasion.
She was a sitting United States senator on October 11, 2002, just weeks after Mr. Trump’s shock jock radio interview.
At 12:50 a. m. she cast her solemn vote to invade Iraq after what she insists was careful and meticulous consideration.
It wasn’t just an   question.
Mrs. Clinton’s vote had the force of law to authorize the Iraq invasion.
In a long, detailed speech on the Senate floor hours earlier, Mrs. Clinton said she cast her vote for authorizing war “with conviction.
” As a result of Mrs. Clinton’s vote to go to war, 4, 424 American troops died  —   fighting for her “conviction.
” Another 31, 952 came home wounded, many of them with grievous injuries and utterly broken  —   all fighting for Mrs. Clinton’s “conviction.
” The number of Americans killed as a result of Donald Trump’s shock jock radio interview: Zero.
Of course, we all know what later happened to Mrs. Clinton’s “conviction”  —   that “conviction” that led to so much bloodshed, so many deaths, so much misery.
In a bid to rescue her political career, Mrs. Clinton’s “conviction” eventually melted into “a mistake.
” And this ________ wants to be   ?
?
?
To hell with that and all her lies and all her “convictions.
” Make Donald Trump   .
And let Howard Stern moderate the next debate.

Protests and riots exploded across California and throughout the nation for the third night after Donald Trump’s surprise victory in the presidential election.
In Oakland, the East Bay Times reports, the rioting is almost out of control.
[However, the link between the protests and the election is increasingly unclear.
“This has nothing to do with Trump,” one resident told the Times.
“It was just an excuse for people who want to get their frustrations out.
It makes me feel really bad for my city.
”  Other residents quoted by the Times agreed: “This just breaks us down and it doesn’t pertain to anything,” said Serrita Panngasiri, whose family members, Laotian immigrants, are the owners.
“We’re trying to get the city to put more lights out here because it gets dark and it’s very dangerous.
” On Thursday night, about 1, 000 protesters in Oakland were kept at bay by police, who were determined to prevent them from blocking the freeway again.
The San Francisco Chronicle reports: Several incidents of graffiti, much of promoting violence and offering such plugs as “Kill Trump,” were reported.
Many small street fires were set and a handful of windows were smashed.
The crimes, though, did not initially appear to be as widespread as the night before.
The Times adds that the protest march in Oakland lasted for five miles.
Elsewhere, hundreds of protesters marched in downtown Los Angeles on Thursday night.
“The crowd halted traffic and was mostly peaceful, but some vandalized property with graffiti, hurled bottles and launched fireworks,” the Los Angeles Times reports.
The Modesto Bee reports that about 100 demonstrators gathered downtown on Thursday night, chanting, “Not my president” and holding “fuck Trump” signs.

Turkey’s president has threatened to pull the plug on the European Union (EU) migrant deal should the EU fall short on any of his demands  —   including visa free travel for 70 million Turks by June.
[In exchange for the return of “irregular migrants” Brussels also agreed in late March to provide up to €6 billion in aid, fast track Turkey’s accession into the EU, and bring thousands of extra Syrians over from camps in Turkey.
Deportations slowly began this week, with just over two hundred Pakistani economic migrants returned across the Aegean.
However, any slip up or delay on the EU’s part could see the gates flung open once more.
“There are precise conditions.
If the European Union does not take the necessary steps, then Turkey will not implement the agreement,” President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan warned in a speech at his 1, 000 room presidential palace in Ankara.
However, Turkey still has 72 conditions of it’s own to meet before it can secure visa free travel, relating to such things as recognising Cyprus and press freedom.
If the EU wavers in these, Turkey could be receiving “discounted” EU membership analysts warn.
“The worst reading of the   deal would be to imagine that Turkey is about to get a ‘discount’ on EU membership conditions just because of the refugees” Marc Pierini, visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe, told AFP.
The increasingly autocratic Islamist President has been accused of “blackmailing” the EU over the migrants deal, as he has consistently employed such combative rhetoric.
On the 11th of January Mr. Erdoğan promised to “open the gates” to hundreds of thousands of migrants who could be transported into Europe by “bus” and even “plane” unless his demands were met in the lead up to the negotiations.
Later, during talk with the EU, Turkey made last minuet demands for up to €20 billion in additional aid, even faster access to Schengen visas for Turkey’s 70 million citizens, and accelerated progress in its EU membership bid.
The Democratic Party has hidden its South Carolina presidential debate  —   and its preferred frontrunner, Hillary Clinton, on the Sunday night of a   weekend.
[Hillary Clinton will be appearing Jan. 17 in a barely publicized Youtube   event from Charleston, where she will go    with insurgent rival Bernie Sanders, and with Martin O’Malley, who literally and inexplicably refuses to quit.
The rhetorical battle between Hillary and Bernie is heating up, with accusations flying back and forth and attacks on each others’ health and families.
Sanders leads Clinton in Iowa and New Hampshire, according to a pair of polls released last week, with a   lead in the latter state.
The difference: white voters.
and   whites are fleeing Clinton in favor of Sanders or Trump.
News that President Obama met privately with Sanders clearly got to the Clinton campaign, which rolled out an effort to push back on the idea that Sanders is the real torchbearer of the Obama legacy.
That’s right.
Hillary Clinton is now attacking Bernie Sanders for not being close enough to Obama.
Top Clinton campaign officials held a press call the morning the polls came out to accuse Sanders of having different policies than Obama.
“The Sanders campaign has understandably tried to eliminate any distinctions between their candidate’s record and President Obama’s,” the Clinton campaign said, referring to immigration and other issues.
“Of course this just isn’t true.
” Clinton, for her part, is trying to run to the left of Sanders, vowing to no longer say “illegal immigrant” among other concessions.
But she’s also using her own daughter Chelsea to direct barbs at Sanders’ record.
“I don’t think about it,” Clinton told CNN about her sinking poll numbers in a tense interview before the State of the Union.
“I don’t pay attention to this.
” (Despite not paying attention, she cited a more favorable “PPP poll” that she claimed was released “an hour later.
”) Asked   if she’s preparing    losses in Iowa and New Hampshire, she said, “I don’t think about that  …    We wouldn’t know what the outcome will be until after a couple rounds of these primaries.
” Sanders’ surge in the polls is a   victory for his campaign manager Jeff Weaver, whom this reporter once spotted in an airport loudly mumbling, “Poll here, poll everywhere.
” Clinton is also facing   investigators from the FBI who are dissecting her private  .
“No, nothing,” Clinton told the Des Moines Register editorial board in an endorsement interview that looked like an interrogation video.
“No, there’s nothing like that that is happening.
No.
” “I saw [the news report] as I was coming in myself, and it was quite, you know, unexpected and unfounded.
” Asked if she planned to comment on it, she said, “No.
I just did.
I guess.
Didn’t I?” She then laughed loudly.
When another reporter asked if Clinton has had “any contact with the FBI” during the course of the investigation, Clinton quickly answered, “No.
”
WASHINGTON (AP)  —   A Democratic elector in Washington state said Friday he won’t vote for Hillary Clinton even if she wins the popular vote in his state on Election Day, adding a degree of suspense when the Electoral College affirms the election results next month.

Clinton Foundation   and longtime Clinton family friend Gilbert Chagoury was denied a visitor visa by the State Department in 2015 for   reasons according to government documents, the LA Times reports.
[Chagoury’s visa denial derived from his political support for Michel Aoun, a Lebanese Christian politician whose political party is part of a coalition with Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim group backed by Iran and which currently holds a terrorist organization classification by the U. S. government.
According to the LA Times, “Last summer, when Chagoury planned a trip to Los Angeles, he applied at the U. S. embassy in Paris for a visitor’s visa and was refused, according to interviews and government documents.
” “Based on the FBI report and other allegations from intelligence and law enforcement sources, the State Department denied the application,” the paper reported.
“It cited   grounds, a broad category that can apply to anyone believed to have assisted a terrorist group in any way, including providing money.
” Chagoury’s connection to the Clintons date back decades.
Chagoury was among the 250 guests who attended the Clintons’ White House Christmas party in 1996, that was just two months after he donated $460, 000 to a controversial     Democratic   group.
Chagoury has a long history of legal drama.
Once known as the “Kingpin” of Nigerian corruption, Chagoury’s name was once added to a federal terrorist   list back in 2010.
After spending several months and thousands in legal fees, Chagoury convinced the U. S. to issue him a written apology, granting him a waiver to fly freely to the U. S. again.
The U. S. government did not however provide an explanation for Chagoury’s being added to the list in the first place.
The billionaires name also appeared in email exchanges from when Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.
In one email exchange, Clinton Foundation senior official Doug Band emailed Clinton’s closest aid Huma Abedin and aid Cheryl Mills requesting help connecting Chagoury with the State Department’s “substance person” on Lebanon affairs.
Abedin later promised to contact the “substance person” about the request.
“This is very important,” Band replied, noting the urgency of the request.
Chagoury has donated $1 to $5 million to the Clinton Foundation.
His company also pledged $1 billion to the Clinton Global Initiative in 2009, the same year the Clinton Global Initiative awarded the Chagoury Group its annual prize for “sustainable development.

Mike Judge, the director and   of the 2006 cult comedy Idiocracy, says a plan to release   Trump campaign ads based on characters in the movie has been canceled by the film rights’ owner 20th Century Fox.
[“It kind of fell apart,” Judge told The Daily Beast.
“It was announced that they were   and I would’ve preferred to make them and then have the people decide.
”  The idea was first hatched by Idiocracy screenwriter Etan Cohen, who took to Twitter in February and acknowledged the perceived parallels between his satirical film and the 2016 presidential election.
“I never expected #idiocracy to become a documentary.
” Cohen quipped.
I never expected #idiocracy to become a documentary.
—   Etan Cohen (@etanjc) February 24, 2016,  Idiocracy follows an “Average Joe” (Luke Wilson) who wakes up 500 years in the future to find an incredibly idiotic American society.
Actor and comedian Terry Crews  —   who plays the burly President Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho  —   “wasn’t happy” about the ads being billed as “” according to Judge.
“Terry Crews had wanted to just make some funny Camacho ads, and Etan [Cohen] and I had written a few that I thought were pretty funny, and it just fell apart,” Judge told the outlet.
“I wanted to put them out a little more quietly and let them go viral, rather than people announcing we’re making   ads.
Just let them be funny first.
” “Also, when Terry heard that announcement he wasn’t happy about it,” he added.
(Warning: Strong Language) Judge suspected that 20th Century Fox, helmed by Republican donor Rupert Murchoch, would be a “roadblock” to the   ads being given the green light.
“I just heard that they were put on the shelf, so it looks like they’re not going to happen,” he said.
Judge, who also wrote TV shows Beavis and Butthead and Silicon Valley and feature films including Tropic Thunder and Office Space, said it’s “surreal” how “one specific thing after another” leads him to believe that truth is stranger than fiction.
“I didn’t want Idiocracy to get popular by the world getting stupider faster,” he told the Daily Beast.

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell wants to burnish the image of his league by embracing feminism promising an expansion of the 2003 “Rooney Rule” that required teams to consider minorities in their executive hiring to now include women.
[Speaking at the first “Women’s Summit” at Super Bowl 50, Goodell stated:   We believe in diversity.
We believe we’re better as an organization when we have good people at the table.
We have great people at the table  …     We’re also seeing it on the field.
Sarah Thomas, Sarah’s right here.
Sarah was our first NFL female official on the field this year.
Sarah, congratulations.
And she did a fantastic job, and we’re very proud of her.
We also have people breaking into coaching ranks.
I don’t know if Jen is here, is Jen here?
Jen’s right next to her.
Jen (Welter) is the first coach last year in the NFL.
And she set a trend, we now have a second coach of the Buffalo Bills, a female coach (Kathryn Smith).
Goodell continued: You can see that progress is being made.
And our commitment is we have something called the Rooney Rule, which requires us to make sure when we have an opening, that on the team or the league level, that we are going to interview a diverse slate of candidates.
Well we’re going to make that commitment and we’re going to formalize that we, as a league, are going to do that with women as well in all of our executive positions.
Again, we’re going to keep making progress here and make a difference.
Precedent exists for women in executive positions in the league Amy Trask served as CEO of the Oakland Raiders for 16 years.
Dawn Aponte presently serves as executive vice president of football administration for the Miami Dolphins.
In 2015, Sarah Thomas became the first female official in the league in January, Kathryn Smith was named special teams assistant coach for the Buffalo Bills.
Many women currently serve as vice presidents for the league itself the NFL claims 30 percent of its employees in the front office are women.
Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who has said since 2002 that she would like to serve as NFL commissioner, added, “They keep looking in the same channels they keep finding the same people.
” Other celebrities invited to speak at the summit include Billie Jean King, Serena Williams, and actress and “American Idol” winner Jordin Sparks.
Actress and Fox News contributor Stacey Dash says it’s “ludicrous” for black entertainers to call for a boycott of the Oscars for not nominating black performers while simultaneously supporting the BET and NAACP Awards which only recognize black artists.
[“I think it’s ludicrous.
We have to make up our minds.
Either we want to have segregation or integration,” Dash said Wednesday on Fox and Friends.
“If we don’t want segregation then we need to get rid of channels like BET and the BET Awards and the [NCAAP] Image Awards where you’re only awarded if you’re black.
If it were the other way around, we’d be up in arms.
” Since last week’s release of the 88th Academy Award nominees, calls for a boycott have come from filmmaker Spike Lee, actress Jada Pinkett Smith, and documentary filmmaker Michael Moore, among others.
Al Sharpton is leading the charge behind a nationwide boycott of the show.
“It’s a double standard,” Dash added.
“Just like there shouldn’t be a black history month.
We’re Americans, period.

GOP presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson discussed the overwhelming level of support for the Democrat Party among Black Americans during an interview on Breitbart News Daily interview with host Stephen K. Bannon.
[Carson says that relationship, “has yielded more poverty and broken homes and crime and incarceration and it’s completely unnecessary.
”  “We need to talk about the effects of out of wedlock birth.
How that stops that woman’s education and sends that child into poverty,” he later added.
He also cited how not having a father figure has a deleterious effect on young black man coming up, “so that they don’t have a good appreciation of how to react to authority, which leads to a lot of death, which leads to a lot of incarceration.
” He also discussed education and “how you can create your own pathway to success” as not having been emphasized enough within the Black community.
Carson also mentioned faith.
Throwing away faith and family are deleterious to any community and it’s extra devastating on the Black community.
And I believe that many people who are trying to cultivate their votes know that and are intentionally destroying those pillars of strength to keep people in a dependent position.
When asked about the harshness of that charge, said Carson, “Well, you look at some of these welfare programs that reward people for having babies out of wedlock   …    that penalize people who have a family structure.
There’s a prime example.
” “In the Black community in this country, there is over $1 trillion in assets.
There are less than ten countries in the world that have a trillion dollar GDP.
Learn how to turn your own dollars over in your own community a couple times before you send them out to create wealth.
Reach back, pull other people up with you  —   you don’t have to be dependent on anybody else,” he added.
Carson encouraged people to review the policies on his website and insisted that he believes he’ll be competitive in South Carolina and is still in the race to win.

Both the victims and the alleged killers in the murder of three people in California were reportedly members of their local ‘furry’ community.
[Last weekend, police were called to the scene by a    girl after her parents  —   Jennifer Yost, 39, and Christopher Yost, 34  —   as well as friend Arthur Boucher, 28, had been shot dead at the Yost’s home in Fullerton, California.
Two men, Frank Felix and Joshua Acosta, have been charged with the murders.
However, it has now emerged that both the alleged killers and their victims were members of a local “furry” community, also known as Furry fandom, which involves dressing up as anthropomorphic animals as a hobby.
Furry fandom also involves attending regular furry conventions for fans to show off their animal alter egos, with victim Katlynn Yost’s chosen species being a wolf, according to her Twitter.

Black Lives Matter (BLM) supporters have claimed the deadly terrorist attack in France was “to make people lose attention” [sic] in their movement and focus on “white” lives instead.
[“Ok I’ve come to the conclusion that what happened in Nice was to make people lose attention off [sic] #BlackLivesMatter and focus and unite against us” wrote Twitter user Semsa, who is based in London but says “Egypt’s the motherland”.
She has since made her account private.
“Don’t #PrayForNice we are fighting a civil war against whites.
#BLM” tweeted Franklin Omar, an activist who also appears to be from London, and describes himself as a “Muslim”.
It’s sad to see where #BLM finds itself these days.
I used to be a huge supporter  …     you guys lost your way.

Adding: “Your women are ours now.
Allah (pbuh) has promised them to us.
Piss off white crusader, watch as Rome burns” and, “lol we’ve already won Europe, USA can’t do anything against the caliphate white pussy, USA men cant fuck, good luck.

Hispanic population here is about 33%.
The voting population of Hispanics isn’t as large, but it’s growing.
And the poll shows increased urgency among Hispanics to vote.
If they do, it will be a changed ballgame here.

JAFFA, Israel  —   A Turkish foundation has launched a public photo exhibition on the Istanbul Metro in a bid to raise awareness of “Jerusalem and the plight of its Palestinian residents.
”[The exhibition, entitled “Dear Passenger, Please Stand Up and Look at Jerusalem” is meant to draw the Turkish people’s attention “to the oppression and injustice that take place in Jerusalem,” said Sabah Addin Yagit, deputy director of Our Heritage Foundation.
“We wish to draw attention to Jerusalem and   Mosque.
”  In addition to raising awareness, the foundation labors “to preserve Ottoman sites and raise money for the benefit of the city’s Palestinian residents,” said one of its leaders, Adam Harmantabe.
The exhibition was set up at the central Taksim station and is set to spread to other stations across the city.
Turkish cultural centers have been mushrooming in Jerusalem lately, including the Ottoman and Turkish language school in the city’s Sheikh Jarrah district.
In addition, the Turkish Culture Center in the adjacent Shuafat district aims to strengthen the ties between Jerusalem’s Palestinians and the Turkish people.
Hundreds of African asylum seekers have flooded Mexican border cities with the U. S. in an effort to get to California and Texas to obtain U. S. asylum  —   many of the unvetted migrants are from the terror hotbed of Somalia.
Rather than having to hide along the way, the African migrants have been getting a special permit from Mexico that gives them a free pass to the U. S. border.
[The influx of asylum seekers from African countries who entered Mexico illegally has been building for several weeks as hundreds of individuals continue to arrive primarily to Mexicali to cross into Calexico, California, in order to seek asylum.
Mexican immigration authorities have been spotted ferrying the asylum seekers from shelters and plazas to international bridges with the U. S.  Mexican immigration authorities have largely kept quiet about the wave of African migrants who have been entering Mexico through that country’s southern border and then making their way to the U. S. border to seek asylum.
Some of the cities they seek include Calexico and San Ysidro, California, and El Paso, Texas.
According to Mexico’s El Universal African migrants have been entering Mexico and almost immediately turning themselves in to agents with the National Immigration Institute (INM).
Once in custody, the migrants receive a special 20 day pass that gives them the freedom to move about the country.
The purpose of the pass is to allow them to get to the U. S. border.
According to El Universal, INM issues the permit to individuals from countries that Mexico does not have diplomatic relations with.
The permit makes it easier for the INM to have the migrants leave the country voluntarily than to deport them to their countries of origin.
During a one week period in late August, there were 424 African migrants who turned themselves in to INM agents in the city of Tapachula, Chiapas.
In 2013, Breitbart Texas Managing Director Brandon Darby warned that the Mexican border provided “a global pathway” for illegal immigrants from the Horn of Africa including those from nations with Islamic terror ties such as Somalia.
According to Mexicali’s La Cronica, on Friday alone there were 180 individuals from Congo, Angola, Somalia and other African countries in the city awaiting for their time to cross.
Other local outlets reported 200 and as many as 300 African immigrants in town on Friday.
According to Mexico’s Televisa News, in August 10, immigration authorities found 52 African illegal immigrants that had been riding in three buses in their attempt to get to the   border.
Mexico’s National Immigration Institute (INM) did not release information of the African detainees at the time.

A Ghanaian developer who created a video game mocking Hillary Clinton has had their account permanently banned from the Google Play Store.
Meanwhile, a number of games simulating violence against the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump, remain hosted on the store.
[The game, ‘Hiliar Clinton,’ is a restaurant simulator that puts you in the role of a burger vendor on a tropical island who has to deliver correct orders to a host of corrupt clients, including the eponymous ‘Hiliar,’ Saudi oil sheikhs, dictators, and ‘Hiliar’s’ husband   …     Bill.
The customers aren’t all bad guys though  —   occasionally, a girl called “Monica Victim” strolls into the store.
It’s not the most original or visually appealing game, but it’s hard to see what in the game could have run afoul of Google’s terms of use.
The game is not libellous  —   it’s obvious satire.
It’s possible that a photoshopped version of the CNN logo, remixed to say “Corrupt News Network,” may have been the reason for the game’s removal.
Copyright tends to be stricter when brands are involved.
But the logo that appears in the game has obviously been altered for the purposes of the game, which means it ought to fall under copyright exceptions designed to protect works of parody.
It’s the same sort of exception that protects Andy Warhol’s Campbell Soup painting.
He didn’t design the logo himself, but by remixing it he turned it into a work of art.
‘Hilliar Clinton’ isn’t a work of art by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a clear work of parody, which raises the question of why the game was banned from the Play Store.
In an email to the game’s creators, Chicane Interactive, Google failed to specify what area of the terms had specifically been violated.
This is a notification that your Google Play Publisher account has been terminated.
REASON FOR TERMINATION: Multiple violations of the Developer Program Policies and Developer Distribution Agreement as outlined in previous emails sent to the registered email address of your Publisher account.
Google Play Publisher terminations are associated with developers, and may span multiple account registrations and related Google services.
You can visit the Developer Policy Center to better understand how we enforce Developer Program Policies.
If you’ve reviewed the policy and feel this termination may have been in error, please reach out to our policy support team.
Please do not attempt to register a new developer account.
We will not be restoring your account at this time.
The Google Play Team, The game’s developer, Chicane Interactive, is a small app development studio based in Ghana.
The studio’s founder says he was drawn to the U. S. elections because of Donald Trump, who he believes is speaking “painful truths” that others don’t want to hear.
In Ghana, a country where many are still below the poverty line, the   $25 registration fee to use the Play Store development console is a significant expense, equivalent to 100 Ghanaian cedis.
The average Ghanian only makes approximately $10, 438 USD a year.
Analysis of Google’s search results from SourceFed earlier this month suggested Google is manipulating search results to favour Hillary Clinton (although Google denied it was doing so.)
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has also accused the search engine of backing the Clintons.
There are still some games mocking Hillary Clinton on the Google Play store (including “Hillaroids,” a game that allows players to blow up asteroids with Clinton’s face on them) which suggests there hasn’t been a wholesale cull of   games on the store.
Then again, there hasn’t been a wholesale cull of conservatives on Twitter or Facebook either  —   instead, they’ve been picked off one by one, in a string of unfair suspensions and bans.
There could be an innocent explanation for the removal of this game of course, but until Google, and other platforms, start to be more specific about why they take decisions to suspend or punish users, it’s impossible to know their reasoning.

Billionaire eBay founder Pierre Omidyar is planning to help Gawker’s appeal of a $140 million jury award to former wrestler Hulk Hogan in a lawsuit secretly funded by billionaire PayPal founder Peter Thiel.
[In what is shaping up to be the “Battle of the Billionaires,” according to Forbes, Omidyar’s First Look Media online news organization is reaching out to other media organizations to file amicus curiae (“friend of the court”)briefs in support of Gawker’s appeal, based on the First Amendment right to freedom of the press.
Hogan, whose real name is Terry Gene Bollea, sued Gawker for invasion of privacy after it published an excerpt of a tape showing Hogan having sexual intercourse with Heather Cole, the   of his best friend,   radio shock jock Bubba the Love Sponge.
The existence of the sex tape was also reported by TMZ and The Dirty by the time that Gawker had published it alongside an A. J. Daulerio essay about celebrity sex tapes.
The Nick   Gawker attempted to argue that it was within its First Amendment rights to decide what was newsworthy, but after a   trial that ended in March, a jury decided that Hogan’s privacy rights were more important.
The jury accessed Gawker $115 million in compensatory damages and $25 million more for punitive damages.
At the May 24 hearing, Gawker’s attorney urged asked the judge for a “remittitur,” reducing or throwing out a jury verdict, and compared the jury’s damages determination to awards against tobacco companies in trials over smoking deaths.
He stated the award was “one of the largest in Florida’s history and grossly excessive compared to the conduct at issue.
” But in the course of the battle, it was revealed that PayPal   Peter Thiel was bankrolling the Hogan lawsuit.
Denton posted an open letter to Thiel after the May 24 hearing: “Your revenge has been served well, cold and (until now) anonymously.
” Denton was referring to the 2007 Gawker story, “Peter Thiel is totally gay, people,” which reportedly angered Thiel.
