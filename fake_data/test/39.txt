" I never saw any gentleman ' s handwriting "-- Emma began , looking also at Mrs . Weston ; but stopped , on perceiving that Mrs . Weston was attending to some one else -- and the pause gave her time to reflect , " Now , how am I going to introduce him ?-- Am I unequal to speaking his name at once before all these people ?
She thought it was time to make up .
Mr . Churchill was better than could be expected ; and their first removal , on the departure of the funeral for Yorkshire , was to be to the house of a very old friend in Windsor , to whom Mr . Churchill had been promising a visit the last ten years .
He may be very ` aimable ,' have very good manners , and be very agreeable ; but he can have no English delicacy towards the feelings of other people : nothing really amiable about him ."
Such events are very interesting , but the suspense of them cannot last long .
" Quite seasonable ; and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin yesterday , and prevent this day ' s party , which it might very possibly have done , for Mr . Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been much snow on the ground ; but now it is of no consequence .
No objection was raised on the father ' s side ; the young man was treated liberally ; it was all as it should be : and as Emma became acquainted with Robert Martin , who was now introduced at Hartfield , she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could bid fairest for her little friend .
I wonder how she speaks of the Coles -- what she calls them !
Mrs . Weston had been delighted before , and was delighted again ; Emma joined her in all her praise ; and the pianoforte , with every proper discrimination , was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise .
for I know gentlemen do not like morning visits , and Mr . Elton ' s time is so engaged ."
Depend upon it , he would not like to have his charade slighted , much better than his passion .
Dear Miss Woodhouse , how could you so mistake me ?"
Elton !"
It was before tea -- stay -- no , it could not be before tea , because we were just going to cards -- and yet it was before tea , because I remember thinking -- Oh !
" My dearest Emma , do not pretend , with your sweet temper , to understand a bad one , or to lay down rules for it : you must let it go its own way .
But Emma still shook her head in steady scepticism .
There is no hurry at all .
Miss Nash had been telling her something , which she repeated immediately with great delight .
" Mrs . Weston ' s manners ," said Emma , " were always particularly good .
Yet he would speak .
Jane ' s solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped Emma .
Still , however , though every thing had not been accomplished by her ingenious device , she could not but flatter herself that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both , and must be leading them forward to the great event .
" I dare say she had ."
I thought you had lost half your property , at least .
I hope you are quite well .
Emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr . Martin ' s prose .
" And when ," thought Emma , " will there be a beginning of Mr .
The delightful family party which Emma was securing for herself , poor Harriet must , in mere charitable caution , be kept at a distance from .
As a magistrate , he had generally some point of law to consult John about , or , at least , some curious anecdote to give ; and as a farmer , as keeping in hand the home - farm at Donwell , he had to tell what every field was to bear next year , and to give all such local information as could not fail of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his life , and whose attachments were strong .
It would be an interesting , and certainly a very kind undertaking ; highly becoming her own situation in life , her leisure , and powers .
Frank ' s was the first idea ; and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it ; for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties , and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance .
At this moment Mr . Weston appeared at a little distance from the window , evidently on the watch .
Wickedness is always wickedness , but folly is not always folly .-- It depends upon the character of those who handle it .
Considering how very handsome she is , she appears to be little occupied with it ; her vanity lies another way .
It was the scrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet ' s account , that gave the deepest hue to his offence .-- Poor Harriet !
" Oh , the difference of situation and habit !
Emma could hardly understand him ; he seemed in an odd humour .
The scene enlarged ; two persons appeared ; Mrs . Weston and her son - in - law ; they were walking into Highbury ;-- to Hartfield of course .
She recovered her voice .
He had a great deal to say in return , and very entertainingly ; but Emma ' s feelings were chiefly with Jane , in the argument ; and on leaving Randalls , and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men , she felt , that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill , and really regarding him as she did with friendship , she had never been more sensible of Mr . Knightley ' s high superiority of character .
The superior degree of confidence towards Harriet , which this one article marked , gave her severe pain .
Had you not been surrounded by other friends , I might have been tempted to introduce a subject , to ask questions , to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct .-- I feel that I should certainly have been impertinent ."
A mind lively and at ease , can do with seeing nothing , and can see nothing that does not answer .
" Never marry !-- This is a new resolution ."
Then , he said , he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day ."
no -- I am grieved to find -- I was on the point of telling you that when I called at Mrs . Goddard ' s door , which I did the very last thing before I returned to dress , I was told that Miss Smith was not better , by no means better , rather worse .
It is not likely you should ever have observed him ; but he knows you very well indeed -- I mean by sight ."
The evening is closing in , and grandmama will be looking for us .
CHAPTER XIV
Short had been the notice -- short their meeting ; he was gone ; and Emma felt so sorry to part , and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from his absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry , and feeling it too much .
He lived about a mile from Highbury , was a frequent visitor , and always welcome , and at this time more welcome than usual , as coming directly from their mutual connexions in London .
" Oh !
Another accidental meeting with the Martins was possible , and in her present state , would be dangerous .
."
She was not to see Frank Churchill this morning .
Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings , Mr . and Mrs . Weston ' s visit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune .
" Don ' t say I was cross .
Keep your raptures for Harriet ' s face .
She never had been so depressed .
a word to the wise .-- I am in a fine flow of spirits , an ' t I ?
You and Miss Smith , and Miss Fairfax , will be three , and the two Miss Coxes five ; and for five couple there will be plenty of room ."
Emma waited the result with impatience , but not without strong hopes .
It was a private resolution of hers , not communicated to him -- or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction .-- Till yesterday , I know he said he was in the dark as to her plans .
Upon these occasions , a lady ' s character generally precedes her ; and Highbury has long known that you are a superior performer ."
In what respect ?
That ' s very like .
I have no doubt of his having , at times , considerable influence ; but it may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand _when_ it will be ."
Jane ' s curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to occupy her .
She looked on with some amusement .-- Miss Bates ' s gratitude for Mrs . Elton ' s attentions to Jane was in the first style of guileless simplicity and warmth .
What is passable in youth is detestable in later age .
It was very lucky , for I would not have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account ; and I am sure she will make a very good servant : she is a civil , pretty - spoken girl ; I have a great opinion of her .
Not that I imagine he can think I have been encouraging him hitherto .
" Those who knew any thing about it , must have felt the difference .
Have you thought , my dear , where you shall put her -- and what room there will be for the children ?"
I could do very well without it .
Emma ' s first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge of what had passed ,-- aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion : but she soon felt that concealment must be impossible .
He came with Mrs . Weston , to whom and to Highbury he seemed to take very cordially .
" Will you read the letter ?"
Emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault .
They all united ; and , on reaching Hartfield gates , Emma , who knew it was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father , pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him .
" In one respect , perhaps , Mr . Elton ' s manners are superior to Mr . Knightley ' s or Mr . Weston ' s .
The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards Harriet , from her mind , while he not only sat at her elbow , but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice , and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion .
.
The greatest kindness you can shew me , will be to let me have my own way , and only say that I am gone when it is necessary ."
The grounds of Hartfield were small , but neat and pretty ; and the house was modern and well - built .
Such language for a young man entirely dependent , to use !-- Nobody but you , Mr . Knightley , would imagine it possible .
Pass us , if you please , Mr . Churchill .
" Well ," said the still waiting Harriet ;--" well -- and -- and what shall I do ?"
Or a trident ?
Oh !
" No , indeed -- _we_ are not at all in a bad air .
If you do not call early it will be a slight ."
I did not know what to do .
Respect would be added to affection .
She has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife ."
" Oh , the difference of situation and habit !
And , by what I understand , you might have had lodgings there quite away from the sea -- a quarter of a mile off -- very comfortable .
She was in no hurry at all .
cried Emma , shaking her head .--" Ah !
" Well ;-- if _you_ wish me to stay and join the party , I will ."
