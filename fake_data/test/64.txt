The son looked convinced .
I have been silent from surprize merely , excessive surprize .
" I have a great curiosity to see Mrs . Elton , I have heard so much of her .
Her next beginning was ,
I never heard any county but Surry called so ."
I always regret excessively on dear Emma ' s account that she cannot be more at Highbury ; but now their daughter is married , I suppose Colonel and Mrs . Campbell will not be able to part with her at all .
` The consequence ,' said she , ` has been a state of perpetual suffering to me ; and so it ought .
If you wish me to talk to Mrs . Hodges , or to inspect anything --"
Do you mean with regard to this letter ?"
" No -- I shall not stir .
I hope they are quite well .
She was too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply : and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for Mr . Elton ' s sanguine state of mind , he tried to take her hand again , as he joyously exclaimed --
" To be sure we do ," cried his father ; " Mrs . Bates -- we passed her house -- I saw Miss Bates at the window .
Another view of man , my second brings , Behold him there , the monarch of the seas !
Though her nephew had had no particular reason to hasten back on her account , she had not lived above six - and - thirty hours after his return .
Oh !
She still intended him for her friend .
It is not that I am without the wish ; but you know how impossible my father would deem it that James should put - to for such a purpose ."
She knows nothing herself , and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing .
" And , moreover , if you must go to the sea , it had better not have been to South End .
" Yes , here I am , my good friend ; and here I have been so long , that anywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise ; but , the truth is , that I am waiting for my lord and master .
Perfectly remember Mrs . Perry ' s coming .-- Extraordinary dream , indeed !"
At this moment whom are you thinking of ?"
But in time they will .
She was sorry , very sorry .
It was a sweet view -- sweet to the eye and the mind .
I am sure I do not know ."
Consider what you are about .
" I shall be very glad to look it over ," said he ; " but it seems long .
I should be surprized if , after seeing them , you could be in company with Mr . Martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior creature -- and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before .
But I am a partial old friend ."
" Where is the young man ?"
Her congratulations were warm and open ; but Emma could not speak so fluently .
I do look forward to it , I own , with _very_ great pleasure ."
Harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion , with great self - command .
When the Campbells are returned , we shall meet them in London , and continue there , I trust , till we may carry her northward .-- But now , I am at such a distance from her -- is not it hard , Miss Woodhouse ?-- Till this morning , we have not once met since the day of reconciliation .
My acquaintance is so very extensive , that I have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her shortly .-- I shall introduce her , of course , very particularly to my brother and sister when they come to us .
Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be expected ; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits , which appeared perfectly natural , as there was a dentist to be consulted ; but , since that business had been over , she did not appear to find Harriet different from what she had known her before .-- Isabella , to be sure , was no very quick observer ; yet if Harriet had not been equal to playing with the children , it would not have escaped her .
I am exceedingly sorry : but it is well that the mistake ends where it does .
Under a bright mid - day sun , at almost Midsummer , Mr . Woodhouse was safely conveyed in his carriage , with one window down , to partake of this al - fresco party ; and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the Abbey , especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning , he was happily placed , quite at his ease , ready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved , and advise every body to come and sit down , and not to heat themselves .-- Mrs . Weston , who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired , and sit all the time with him , remained , when all the others were invited or persuaded out , his patient listener and sympathiser .
No , you shall send it to Hartfield , if you please .
papa -- that is what you never have been able to accomplish , and I do not think you ever will .
" Perry !"
" Ah !
" I doubt its being very clever myself ," said Mr . Weston .
Frank was standing by her , but not steadily ; there was a restlessness , which shewed a mind not at ease .
Mr . Perry had been to Mrs . Goddard ' s to attend a sick child , and Miss Nash had seen him , and he had told Miss Nash , that as he was coming back yesterday from Clayton Park , he had met Mr . Elton , and found to his great surprize , that Mr . Elton was actually on his road to London , and not meaning to return till the morrow , though it was the whist - club night , which he had been never known to miss before ; and Mr . Perry had remonstrated with him about it , and told him how shabby it was in him , their best player , to absent himself , and tried very much to persuade him to put off his journey only one day ; but it would not do ; Mr . Elton had been determined to go on , and had said in a _very_ _particular_ way indeed , that he was going on business which he would not put off for any inducement in the world ; and something about a very enviable commission , and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious .
" Oh !
She must tell you herself what she is -- yet not by word , for never was there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her own merit .-- Since I began this letter , which will be longer than I foresaw , I have heard from her .-- She gives a good account of her own health ; but as she never complains , I dare not depend .
if you knew how much I love every thing that is decided and open !-- Good - bye , good - bye ."
It was not unlikely , she thought , that she might see Mr . Knightley in her way ; or , perhaps , he might come in while she were paying her visit .
I do not advise the custard .
" No , indeed I do not ."
She always travels with her own sheets ; an excellent precaution .
He had gone away deeply offended -- he came back engaged to another -- and to another as superior , of course , to the first , as under such circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost .
Emma hung about him affectionately , and smiled , and said it must be so ; and that he must not class her with Isabella and Mrs . Weston , whose marriages taking them from Hartfield , had , indeed , made a melancholy change : but she was not going from Hartfield ; she should be always there ; she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better ; and she was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having Mr . Knightley always at hand , when he were once got used to the idea .-- Did he not love Mr . Knightley very much ?-- He would not deny that he did , she was sure .-- Whom did he ever want to consult on business but Mr .
said Miss Bates , joyfully ; " my mother is so pleased !-- she says she cannot bear to have the poor old Vicarage without a mistress .
What is passable in youth is detestable in later age .
No , she had had enough of interference .
As he became rational , he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in their authority .
It was hardly right ; but it had been so strong an idea , that it would escape her , and his submission to all that she told , was a compliment to her penetration , which made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue .
With the view of passing off an awkward moment , Emma smilingly said ,
She should then have heard more : Mrs . Weston would speak to her , with a degree of unreserve which she would not hazard with Isabella ; and , she really believed , would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills from her , excepting those views on the young man , of which her own imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge .
You have many parties of that kind here , I suppose , Miss Woodhouse , every summer ?"
Have you finished it ?
" I am afraid Jane is not very well ," said she , " but I do not know ; they _tell_ me she is well .
What say you both to our collecting the same party , and exploring to Box Hill again , while the fine weather lasts ?-- It must be the same party , you know , quite the same party , not _one_ exception ."
" How do you do , Mrs . Ford ?
You must be the best judge of your own happiness .
But in every respect , as she saw more of her , she approved her , and was confirmed in all her kind designs .
Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with her grandmother and aunt , and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state .
That , I thought , in a man of known musical talent , was some proof ."
Do not let us be too solemn on the business .
I could not have believed it !
I am sure I must have been as white as my gown .
No , no ; she has qualities which may be trusted ; she will never lead any one really wrong ; she will make no lasting blunder ; where Emma errs once , she is in the right a hundred times ."
Something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way through a storm of snow ."
" Well , Miss Woodhouse ," he almost immediately began , " your inclination for dancing has not been quite frightened away , I hope , by the terrors of my father ' s little rooms .
Somebody else believed _Mrs_ .
Emma did not want to be classed with the Mrs . Eltons , the Mrs . Perrys , and the Mrs . Coles , who would force themselves anywhere ; neither could she feel any right of preference herself -- she submitted , therefore , and only questioned Miss Bates farther as to her niece ' s appetite and diet , which she longed to be able to assist .
I could change my shoes , you know , the moment I got home ; and it is not the sort of thing that gives me cold ."
She was his object , and every body must perceive it .
" Poor girl !"
" But why should you be sorry , sir ?-- I assure you , it did the children a great deal of good ."
There was no comfort in having him in London ; he might as well be at Enscombe ; but Richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse .
To you , he will talk of farming ; to me , of drawing or music ; and so on to every body , having that general information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead , or take the lead , just as propriety may require , and to speak extremely well on each ; that is my idea of him ."
" And I am changed also ; for I am now very willing to grant you all Harriet ' s good qualities .
" There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _that_ ,"-- said Mr . Knightley , feelingly ; and for a moment or two he had done .
I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I had been of some use ; but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they may .
They must not over - salt the leg ; and then , if it is not over - salted , and if it is very thoroughly boiled , just as Serle boils ours , and eaten very moderately of , with a boiled turnip , and a little carrot or parsnip , I do not consider it unwholesome ."
I can easily believe that letters are very little to you , much less than to me , but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the difference , it is not age , but situation .
They were soon joined by some of the gentlemen ; and the very first of the early was Frank Churchill .
" How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this occasion , Miss Fairfax .
The affection of the whole family , the warm attachment of Miss Campbell in particular , was the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of Jane ' s decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements .
She is loveliness itself .
Emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little self - willed , and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of dancing with her ; but she took the compliment , and forgave the rest .
Elton , and Miss Hawkins !-- Good morning to you ."
Part of every winter she had been used to spend in Bath ; but Bristol was her home , the very heart of Bristol ; for though the father and mother had died some years ago , an uncle remained -- in the law line -- nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him , than that he was in the law line ; and with him the daughter had lived .
He did not suppose they could be damp now , in the middle of the day .
Now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus -- so she was rather disappointed , but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body , for fear of its getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse , who would be so very much concerned !-- Well , this is brilliant !
