" Aye , very true , my dear ," cried the latter , though Jane had not spoken a word --" I was just going to say the same thing .
But you , ( turning to Mr . Knightley ,) who know how very , very seldom I am ever two hours from Hartfield , why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me , I cannot imagine .
It is such a blessing !
you will never guess .
Mr . Elton was still talking , still engaged in some interesting detail ; and Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday ' s party at his friend Cole ' s , and that she was come in herself for the Stilton cheese , the north Wiltshire , the butter , the cellery , the beet - root , and all the dessert .
Well , Mrs . Weston , you have prevailed , I hope , and these ladies will oblige us ."
What was to be done ?
She thinks so little of her own beauty .
I shall be at home in twenty minutes ."
I should be quite in the way .
" Are you sure ?
Miss Churchill , however , being of age , and with the full command of her fortune -- though her fortune bore no proportion to the family - estate -- was not to be dissuaded from the marriage , and it took place , to the infinite mortification of Mr . and Mrs . Churchill , who threw her off with due decorum .
Miss Bates said a great deal ; Mrs . Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse ' s presiding ; Mr . Knightley ' s answer was the most distinct .
I left them there and came on to Hartfield , impatient for your opinion , and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot .
Oh !
He had only himself to please in his choice : his fortune was his own ; for as to Frank , it was more than being tacitly brought up as his uncle ' s heir , it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume the name of Churchill on coming of age .
Mrs . Elton ' s resources were inadequate to such an attack .
It was dreadfully mortifying ; but Mr . Elton was proving himself , in many respects , the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him ; proud , assuming , conceited ; very full of his own claims , and little concerned about the feelings of others .
" But , my dear sir ," cried Mr . Weston , " if Emma comes away early , it will be breaking up the party ."
What say you both to our collecting the same party , and exploring to Box Hill again , while the fine weather lasts ?-- It must be the same party , you know , quite the same party , not _one_ exception ."
They are all remarkably clever ; and they have so many pretty ways .
Better accommodations , he can promise them , and not a less grateful welcome than at Randalls .
Oh !
Harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager exclamation .
They would hardly come in their chaise , I think , at that season of the year .
Happily it was not necessary to speak .
Many counties , I believe , are called the garden of England , as well as Surry ."
She was always quick and assured : Isabella slow and diffident .
He contrived that she should be seated by him ; and was sufficiently employed in looking out the best baked apple for her , and trying to make her help or advise him in his work , till Jane Fairfax was quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again .
I condition for nothing else ; but without music , life would be a blank to me .'"
I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else .
Can you seriously ask me , Harriet , whether I imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that I was -- tacitly , if not openly -- encouraging you to give way to your own feelings ?-- I never had the slightest suspicion , till within the last hour , of Mr . Frank Churchill ' s having the least regard for Jane Fairfax .
No , no ; she has qualities which may be trusted ; she will never lead any one really wrong ; she will make no lasting blunder ; where Emma errs once , she is in the right a hundred times ."
He only means --"
But James will not like to put the horses to for such a little way ;-- and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit ?"
His tall , firm , upright figure , among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men , was such as Emma felt must draw every body ' s eyes ; and , excepting her own partner , there was not one among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him .-- He moved a few steps nearer , and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner , with what natural grace , he must have danced , would he but take the trouble .-- Whenever she caught his eye , she forced him to smile ; but in general he was looking grave .
" Ah !
She had hurried on before her guests to prepare her father for their appearance , and was beyond the reach of Mr . Weston ' s hint .
It was not the gipsies -- it was not Mr . Frank Churchill that I meant .
The prospect before her now , was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled -- that might not be even partially brightened .
We copied it from the Elegant Extracts .
One man ' s style must not be the rule of another ' s .
Three months , she says so , positively , as I am going to have the pleasure of reading to you .
Not that Emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity ; it was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected .
It was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits .
said Emma in a whisper .
I thought I could not be so deceived ; but now , it is clear ; the state of his mind is as clear and decided , as my wishes on the subject have been ever since I knew you .
Serle understands boiling an egg better than any body .
But from one cause or another , I gave it up in disgust .
Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home , and thought this the best offer she was likely to have ."
This was all that was generally known of her history .
" I do not know what I could imagine , but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers .
It had just occurred to Mrs . Weston that Mrs . Elton must be asked to begin the ball ; that she would expect it ; which interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction .-- Emma heard the sad truth with fortitude .
If _we_ set the example , many will follow it as far as they can ; though all have not our situations .
" Well , I am so sorry !-- Oh !
The visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day ; and all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion , must be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity .
I believe you were glad we danced no longer ; but I would have given worlds -- all the worlds one ever has to give -- for another half - hour ."
We shall have no occasion to open the windows at all -- not once the whole evening ; and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows , letting in cold air upon heated bodies , which ( as you well know , sir ) does the mischief ."
He came to the Abbey two evenings ago , on purpose to consult me about it .
What is right to be done cannot be done too soon .
Colonel Campbell , you know , is quite our angel .
It seemed an unnecessary caution ; Jane was wanting to give her words , not to Mrs . Elton , but to Miss Woodhouse , as the latter plainly saw .
I have a very sincere interest in Emma .
See the consequence of keeping you company !-- What do you say to it ?"
How well you put it on !-- so gratified !
How cheerful , how animated , how suspicious , how busy their imaginations all are !"
He will be so pleased to see my little ones ."
" What do you say to Mrs .
I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall make this rivet quite firm .
but indeed I would much rather have it only in one .
but indeed I would much rather have it only in one .
Bless me !
" My dear Miss Woodhouse , a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act .
She did not regret it .
" So obliged to you !-- so very much obliged to you for the carriage ," resumed Miss Bates .
I really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else ."
The following day brought news from Richmond to throw every thing else into the background .
--
Mrs . Elton left them no choice .
he is off .
CHAPTER VI
It was easy to decide that she was still too young ; and Jane remained with them , sharing , as another daughter , in all the rational pleasures of an elegant society , and a judicious mixture of home and amusement , with only the drawback of the future , the sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over .
This must not be ."
Let us have patience .
I congratulate you , my dear Harriet , with all my heart .
I should like to see Emma in love , and in some doubt of a return ; it would do her good .
And such a noble fire !-- I am quite roasted .
She need not trouble herself to pity him .
" You mean to return a favourable answer , I collect ."
I shall never forget it .
So much superadded decision of character !
Every thing that I have said or done , for many weeks past , has been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself .
It regarded a supper - room .
" Dear me !
Two dances , unfortunately , were all that could be allowed .
I want you to save yourself from greater pain .
Mrs . Weston undertakes to direct the whole ."
And then whispering -- " Our companions are excessively stupid .
And there was time enough for Emma to form a reasonable judgment , as their visit included all the rest of the morning .
" I can answer for every thing of that nature , sir , because it will be under Mrs . Weston ' s care .
