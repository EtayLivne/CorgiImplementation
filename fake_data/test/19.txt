-- Emma had promised ; but still Harriet must be excepted .
" So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears !
I never hear better sense from any one than Robert Martin .
Elton ?"
" I always told you she was -- a little ; but you will soon overcome all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome , all that has its foundation in diffidence .
Emma , on reaching home , called the housekeeper directly , to an examination of her stores ; and some arrowroot of very superior quality was speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note .
dear Mrs . Elton , so obliged to you for the carriage !-- excellent time .
" Aye , we men are sad fellows .
I would not have Mr . Knightley know any thing about it for the world !
It must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed ; and she hoped , that when able to see them together again , she might at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were .-- She should see them henceforward with the closest observance ; and wretchedly as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching , she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here .-- He was expected back every day .
The carriage -- we had disappointments about the carriage ;-- one morning , I remember , he came to me quite in despair ."
The carriage came : and Mr . Woodhouse , always the first object on such occasions , was carefully attended to his own by Mr . Knightley and Mr . Weston ; but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen , and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for .
He will connect himself well if he can ."
In what respect ?
Those soft blue eyes , and all those natural graces , should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its connexions .
It was the end of an old pencil ,-- the part without any lead .
He began -- stopping , however , almost directly to say , " Had I been offered the sight of one of this gentleman ' s letters to his mother - in - law a few months ago , Emma , it would not have been taken with such indifference ."
Can you seriously ask me , Harriet , whether I imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that I was -- tacitly , if not openly -- encouraging you to give way to your own feelings ?-- I never had the slightest suspicion , till within the last hour , of Mr . Frank Churchill ' s having the least regard for Jane Fairfax .
Read it in comfort to yourself .
And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my three turns -- my winter walk ."
He stopped .-- Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs . Weston , and did not herself know what to think .
" Colonel and Mrs . Campbell are to be in town again by midsummer ," said Jane .
she was going to exclaim ; but she presently found that it was a family of old friends , who were coming , like herself , by particular desire , to help Mr . Weston ' s judgment ; and they were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins , who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness , on the same errand , that it seemed as if half the company might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection .
While he was so dull , it was no wonder that Harriet should be dull likewise ; and they were both insufferable .
no -- what an impudent dog I was !-- How could I dare --"
Mrs . Elton ' s invitations I should have imagined any thing but inviting ."
Well , I wish them happy with all my heart .
It was done however .
Mr . Knightley ' s eyes had preceded Miss Bates ' s in a glance at Jane .
A variety of evils crossed his mind .
But Harriet was in a tremor , and could not touch it ; and Emma , never loth to be first , was obliged to examine it herself .
" Miss Woodhouse ," said Frank Churchill , after examining a table behind him , which he could reach as he sat , " have your nephews taken away their alphabets -- their box of letters ?
What has it been but a system of hypocrisy and deceit ,-- espionage , and treachery ?-- To come among us with professions of openness and simplicity ; and such a league in secret to judge us all !-- Here have we been , the whole winter and spring , completely duped , fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and honour , with two people in the midst of us who may have been carrying round , comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both to hear .-- They must take the consequence , if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable !"
Harriet slept at Hartfield that night .
You provide for the family , you know , ( with a smile at his father ).
Emma even jumped with surprize ;-- and , horror - struck , exclaimed ,
" We are sure of excellent fires ," continued he , " and every thing in the greatest comfort .
My acquaintance with him has been but trifling .-- And even if I have not underrated him hitherto , he may yet turn out well .-- With such a woman he has a chance .-- I have no motive for wishing him ill -- and for her sake , whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct , I shall certainly wish him well ."
It will do you good to speak of your distress , whatever it may be ."
That was the act of a very , very young man , one too young to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure .
said Frank Churchill .
By only raising my voice , and saying any thing two or three times over , she is sure to hear ; but then she is used to my voice .
" You are extremely kind ," replied Miss Bates , highly gratified ; " you who are such a judge , and write so beautifully yourself .
But what can be the matter ?-- Is she really not ill ?"
And she is a good - natured woman after all .
She has a fault .
" I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry .
CHAPTER XV
Mr . Churchill ' s loss would be dreadful indeed .
" My dear Jane , say no more about it .
" Ah !
Emma ' s going away directly after tea might be giving offence .
What !
They sat down to tea -- the same party round the same table -- how often it had been collected !-- and how often had her eyes fallen on the same shrubs in the lawn , and observed the same beautiful effect of the western sun !-- But never in such a state of spirits , never in any thing like it ; and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house , or even the attentive daughter .
The first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to attend , was the name of Jane Fairfax .
Were she a woman of fortune , I would leave every harmless absurdity to take its chance , I would not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner .
Her approbation , at once general and minute , warm and incessant , could not but please ; and for another half - hour they were all walking to and fro , between the different rooms , some suggesting , some attending , and all in happy enjoyment of the future .
Not to wait upon a bride is very remiss .
But that would be all over now .-- Poor fellow !-- No more exploring parties to Donwell made for _her_ .
I am sorry for it .
Had she followed Mr . Knightley ' s known wishes , in paying that attention to Miss Fairfax , which was every way her due ; had she tried to know her better ; had she done her part towards intimacy ; had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith ; she must , in all probability , have been spared from every pain which pressed on her now .-- Birth , abilities , and education , had been equally marking one as an associate for her , to be received with gratitude ; and the other -- what was she ?-- Supposing even that they had never become intimate friends ; that she had never been admitted into Miss Fairfax ' s confidence on this important matter -- which was most probable -- still , in knowing her as she ought , and as she might , she must have been preserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr . Dixon , which she had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself , but had so unpardonably imparted ; an idea which she greatly feared had been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane ' s feelings , by the levity or carelessness of Frank Churchill ' s .
You are too bountiful !
But I am a partial old friend ."
" Well , sir ," cried Mr . Weston , " as I took Miss Taylor away , it is incumbent on me to supply her place , if I can ; and I will step to Mrs . Goddard in a moment , if you wish it ."
I have no business to put myself forward ."
I think you will agree with me , ( turning with a soft air to Emma ,) I think I shall certainly have your approbation , though Mr . Knightley perhaps , from being used to the large parties of London , may not quite enter into our feelings ."
" You speak too plain .
The visit was of course short ; and there was so much embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it , that Emma would not allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady , and on no account to give one , beyond the nothing - meaning terms of being " elegantly dressed , and very pleasing ."
Mr . Knightley might quarrel with her , but Emma could not quarrel with herself .
With this treatment , Mr . Woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking as usual .
But she had believed them to be well - meaning , worthy people before ; and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion ?
" I hope she does .
The circumstance was told him at Hartfield ; for the moment , he was silent ; but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself , over a newspaper he held in his hand , " Hum !
He was not a great favourite with his fair sister - in - law .
They might all have hoped to rise by Harriet ' s acquaintance : and besides , what was the value of Harriet ' s description ?-- So easily pleased -- so little discerning ;-- what signified her praise ?
But this does not acquit _him_ , Mrs . Weston ; and I must say , that I think him greatly to blame .
I ' d rather you would ."
She does not depend upon his coming so much as I do : but she does not know the parties so well as I do .
Let me recommend Bath to you .
Mr . Knightley ' s excessive curiosity to know what this word might be , made him seize every possible moment for darting his eye towards it , and it was not long before he saw it to be _Dixon_ .
I cannot doubt it .
" She is a riddle , quite a riddle !"
Perry tells me that Mr . Cole never touches malt liquor .
It is a sort of prologue to the play , a motto to the chapter ; and will be soon followed by matter - of - fact prose ."
Never better .-- Don ' t I hear another carriage ?-- Who can this be ?-- very likely the worthy Coles .-- Upon my word , this is charming to be standing about among such friends !
Miss Bates ' s powerful , argumentative mind might have strengthened yours ."
For half an hour Mr . Weston was surprized and sorry ; but then he began to perceive that Frank ' s coming two or three months later would be a much better plan ; better time of year ; better weather ; and that he would be able , without any doubt , to stay considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner .
Her mind was quite sick of Mr . Elton and the Martins .
" I have heard her speak of the acquaintance ," said Emma ; " she is a very elegant young woman ."
" Good God !"
Do you think I am right ?"
-- She was afraid she had done her nothing but disservice .-- It was true that she had not to charge herself , in this instance as in the former , with being the sole and original author of the mischief ; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered Harriet ' s imagination ; for Harriet had acknowledged her admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she had ever given her a hint on the subject ; but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed .
She was obliged , in spite of her previous determination to the contrary , to do it all the justice that Mrs . Weston foretold .
She was to convey Harriet , and they drove to the Crown in good time , the Randalls party just sufficiently before them .
What was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body ; and he had , therefore , earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any wedding - cake at all , and when that proved vain , as earnestly tried to prevent any body ' s eating it .
Isabella stept in after her father ; John Knightley , forgetting that he did not belong to their party , stept in after his wife very naturally ; so that Emma found , on being escorted and followed into the second carriage by Mr . Elton , that the door was to be lawfully shut on them , and that they were to have a tete - a - tete drive .
There is such perfect good - temper and good - will in Mr . Elton as one cannot but value ."
A thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have ever shewn me , and ten thousand for the attentions your heart will dictate towards her .-- If you think me in a way to be happier than I deserve , I am quite of your opinion .-- Miss W . calls me the child of good fortune .
" So unreasonably early !"
You are quite mistaken .
