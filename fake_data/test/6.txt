Till you chose to turn her into a friend , her mind had no distaste for her own set , nor any ambition beyond it .
" And who do you think came in while we were there ?"
The unpersuadable point , which he did not mention , Emma guessed to be good behaviour to his father .
" It is very pretty ," said Mr . Woodhouse .
That ' s one of the ladies in the Irish car party , not at all like her .-- Well , I declare --"
Oh , no !
" It is one that I shall never change , however ."
Let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations .
with the help of spectacles .
The case , you see , is --( but this is quite between ourselves : I did not mention a syllable of it in the other room .
Mrs . Weston , you would be quite laid up ; do not let them talk of such a wild thing .
The pleasantness of the morning had induced him to walk forward , and leave his horses to meet him by another road , a mile or two beyond Highbury -- and happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before of Miss Bates , and to have forgotten to restore them , he had been obliged to stop at her door , and go in for a few minutes : he was therefore later than he had intended ; and being on foot , was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them .
Emma was extremely gratified .-- They were interrupted by the bustle of Mr . Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again .
and A .-- Em - ma .-- Do you understand ?"
You know , my dear , she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor was to us .
Kitty , a fair but frozen maid , Kindled a flame I yet deplore , The hood - wink ' d boy I called to aid , Though of his near approach afraid , So fatal to my suit before .
The youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy , and of powerful operation ; and if the distress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed , they will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope .
Knightley .--" Robert Martin ' s manners have sense , sincerity , and good - humour to recommend them ; and his mind has more true gentility than Harriet Smith could understand ."
Compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these words --" I had not a spare moment on Tuesday , as you know , for Miss Woodhouse ' s beautiful little friend .
" Oh , what a sweet house !-- How very beautiful !-- There are the yellow curtains that Miss Nash admires so much ."
It was kindly said , and very far from giving offence .
We feel things differently .
I could not give any connected detail yesterday ; but the suddenness , and , in one light , the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out , needs explanation ; for though the event of the 26th ult ., as you will conclude , immediately opened to me the happiest prospects , I should not have presumed on such early measures , but from the very particular circumstances , which left me not an hour to lose .
There was no comfort in having him in London ; he might as well be at Enscombe ; but Richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse .
You must promise me not to sit up ."
But , as it is , the disappointment is single , and , I trust , will not be lasting .
A variety of evils crossed his mind .
" And I am changed also ; for I am now very willing to grant you all Harriet ' s good qualities .
Things did not seem -- that is , there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some .-- So it appeared to me at least , but I might be mistaken .
While either of them protected him and his , Hartfield was safe .-- But Mr . John Knightley must be in London again by the end of the first week in November .
Henceforward I know nothing of the matter .
When they all sat down it was better ; to her taste a great deal better , for Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay , making her his first object .
" Mr . Elton going to be married !"
" I thank you ; but I assure you you are quite mistaken .
She did not wish to speak of the pianoforte , she felt too much in the secret herself , to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair , and therefore purposely kept at a distance ; but by the others , the subject was almost immediately introduced , and she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations were received , the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of " my excellent friend Colonel Campbell ."
At first it was downright dulness to Emma .
I am sure she will be an excellent servant ; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see .
" Upon my word ," said Emma , " I begin to doubt my having any such talent .
" There , papa !-- Now you must be satisfied -- Our own dear Mrs . Weston , who is carefulness itself .
" Do you dare say this ?"
" Well ," said Emma , willing to let it pass --" you want to hear about the wedding ; and I shall be happy to tell you , for we all behaved charmingly .
Hitherto I fancy you and I are the only people to whom his looks and manners have explained themselves ."
" He told me at parting , that he should soon write ; and he spoke in a manner which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now .
Oh , no !
You must grant me that ."
Certain it was that she was to come ; and that Highbury , instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which had been so long promised it -- Mr . Frank Churchill -- must put up for the present with Jane Fairfax , who could bring only the freshness of a two years ' absence .
If he were deficient there , nothing should make amends for it .
The fever was over , and Emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by injurious courtesy .
No , no ; she has qualities which may be trusted ; she will never lead any one really wrong ; she will make no lasting blunder ; where Emma errs once , she is in the right a hundred times ."
My acquaintance with him has been but trifling .-- And even if I have not underrated him hitherto , he may yet turn out well .-- With such a woman he has a chance .-- I have no motive for wishing him ill -- and for her sake , whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct , I shall certainly wish him well ."
What a blessing it is , when undue influence does not survive the grave !-- He gave his consent with very little persuasion ."
On the contrary , I think a young man might be very safely recommended to take Mr . Elton as a model .
At last , and tolerably in his usual tone , he said ,
Don ' t let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman ."
He was not in his best spirits , but seemed trying to improve them ; and , at last , made himself talk nonsense very agreeably .
She felt herself a most fortunate woman ; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought , where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled , and who could ill bear to part with her .
Mrs . Churchill will not be second to any lady in the land for "--
" His aunt was so much better , that he had not a doubt of getting over to them ."-- Mrs .
Even _your_ satisfaction I made sure of .
They can do nothing satisfactorily without you ."
You are always with me ."
She has a fault .
She is a flatterer in all her ways ; and so much the worse , because undesigned .
You do not know what it is to have tempers to manage ."
Do not mimic her .
But James will not like to put the horses to for such a little way ;-- and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit ?"
" A very pleasant evening ," he began , as soon as Mr . Woodhouse had been talked into what was necessary , told that he understood , and the papers swept away ;--" particularly pleasant .
They will have their barouche - landau , of course , which holds four perfectly ; and therefore , without saying any thing of _our_ carriage , we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well .
Two months must bring it to the proof .
It was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was _not_ a fine lady ; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of it ;-- and she was considering in what way she had best retract , when Mr . Weston went on .
was Mr . Woodhouse ' s first exclamation , and all that he could say for some time .
It was her own universal good - will and contented temper which worked such wonders .
I like them extremely .
I should be surprized if , after seeing them , you could be in company with Mr . Martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior creature -- and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before .
Wingfield thinks the vicinity of Brunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as to air ."
I heard a good deal of Colonel Campbell ' s taste at Weymouth ; and the softness of the upper notes I am sure is exactly what he and _all_ _that_ _party_ would particularly prize .
I believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing - room that we are expecting Frank .
" Mrs . Dixon !
No , indeed , Miss Woodhouse , you need not be afraid ; I can sit and admire him now without any great misery .
Poor Mr . Woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming , and so anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride .-- Could he have seen the heart , he would have cared very little for the lungs ; but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil , without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either , he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he had received from Mr . Perry , and talked on with much self - contentment , totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him in return .
In spite of the answer , therefore , she ordered the carriage , and drove to Mrs . Bates ' s , in the hope that Jane would be induced to join her -- but it would not do ;-- Miss Bates came to the carriage door , all gratitude , and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest service -- and every thing that message could do was tried -- but all in vain .
Emma was rather in dismay when only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things , and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment .
" Very true ," said Harriet .
It is the greatest amusement in the world !
yes , I am quite aware of that .
" My mother ' s deafness is very trifling you see -- just nothing at all .
She was so eager to have them drawn that I could not refuse ; but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know ; nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them , beyond the air and complexion , unless they are coarser featured than any of mama ' s children ever were .
" That ' s right , my dear , very right .
This was one of her expressions .
A man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her ."
" But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so soon , though he does .
I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I did , but something or other hindered me all the morning ; first one thing , then another , there is no saying what , you know .
Now they seemed in pleasant conversation .
Mr . Knightley was thoughtful again .
He gave her to understand that Frank admired her extremely -- thought her very beautiful and very charming ; and with so much to be said for him altogether , she found she must not judge him harshly .
Pardon me -- but you will be limited as to number -- only three at once ."
He positively said that it had been known to no being in the world but their two selves ."
Did you ever hear any thing so strange ?
The quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for Mr . Woodhouse , who had often been distressed by the more animated sort , which Mr . Weston had occasionally introduced , and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting , with tender melancholy , over the departure of the " poor little boys ," or in fondly pointing out , as he took up any stray letter near him , how beautifully Emma had written it .
The Woodhouses were first in consequence there .
