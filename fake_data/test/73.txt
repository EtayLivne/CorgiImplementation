I never met with a disposition more truly amiable ."
_Now_ I shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you ."
" No , I have not ; I know nothing ; pray tell me ."
.
" Yes ," said Mr . John Knightley presently , with some slyness , " he seems to have a great deal of good - will towards you ."
" You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill , I presume ," he continued -- " and know him to be my son , though he does not bear my name ."
Her congratulations were warm and open ; but Emma could not speak so fluently .
He was on the move immediately ; but coming back , said ,
There go you and your riddle - book one of these days ."
I have a great deal of vivacity in my own way , but I really must be allowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue .
" I cannot make speeches , Emma :" he soon resumed ; and in a tone of such sincere , decided , intelligible tenderness as was tolerably convincing .--" If I loved you less , I might be able to talk about it more .
Emma had never been to Box Hill ; she wished to see what every body found so well worth seeing , and she and Mr . Weston had agreed to chuse some fine morning and drive thither .
She paused a few moments .
She saw , that in persuading herself , in fancying , in acting to the contrary , she had been entirely under a delusion , totally ignorant of her own heart -- and , in short , that she had never really cared for Frank Churchill at all !
Depend upon it , he would not like to have his charade slighted , much better than his passion .
You seem shut out from every thing -- in the most complete retirement .-- And Mrs . Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion .
The preparations must take their time , nothing could be properly ready till the third week were entered on , and for a few days they must be planning , proceeding and hoping in uncertainty -- at the risk -- in her opinion , the great risk , of its being all in vain .
" If I know myself , Harriet , mine is an active , busy mind , with a great many independent resources ; and I do not perceive why I should be more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one - and - twenty .
The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here , and stand very much in the same way -- just across the lawn ; and I had a glimpse of a fine large tree , with a bench round it , which put me so exactly in mind !
On this article I can fully acquit him .
I cannot be so sanguine as Mr . Weston .
In her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her .
at present I ask no more ."
" Upon my word it is , Miss Bates .-- He really is engaged from morning to night .-- There is no end of people ' s coming to him , on some pretence or other .-- The magistrates , and overseers , and churchwardens , are always wanting his opinion .
The persons to be invited , required little thought .
Poor Perry is bilious , and he has not time to take care of himself -- he tells me he has not time to take care of himself -- which is very sad -- but he is always wanted all round the country .
Some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings .
Elton was sitting here , I remember , much about where I am now ."
There is great fear , great caution , great resolution somewhere .-- She is _not_ to be with the _Dixons_ .
She had reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold , and it was desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of her other complaint before the gentleman ' s return .
You will not be sorry to find yourself at home ."
" What is to be done , my dear Emma ?-- what is to be done ?"
She now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark .
Impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort ; if we except , perhaps , Mrs . Suckling ' s own family , and Mrs . Bragge ' s ; but Mrs . Smallridge is intimate with both , and in the very same neighbourhood :-- lives only four miles from Maple Grove .
She was your governess , I think ?"
He might even have Harriet in his thoughts at the moment ; who could say ?
A circumstance rather unlucky occurred .
If not wise or refined herself , she would have connected him with those who were ; but Miss Hawkins , it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit , had been the best of her own set .
CHAPTER II
Now will be the time .
" Did you see her often at Weymouth ?
Jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour , and they had only accomplished some views of St . Mark ' s Place , Venice , when Frank Churchill entered the room .
It would hold the very number for comfort .
" It is odd though ," observed his father , " that you should have had such a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you should be thinking of at Enscombe .
She wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration .
There were not merely no grammatical errors , but as a composition it would not have disgraced a gentleman ; the language , though plain , was strong and unaffected , and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer .
" I dare say they are , sir .
" To be sure we do ," cried his father ; " Mrs . Bates -- we passed her house -- I saw Miss Bates at the window .
That is , _I_ always had a strong persuasion he would be here again soon , I was sure something favourable would turn up -- but nobody believed me .
I hope she is right .-- In one respect , my good fortune is undoubted , that of being able to subscribe myself , Your obliged and affectionate Son , F . C . WESTON CHURCHILL .
Mr . Elton was still talking , still engaged in some interesting detail ; and Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday ' s party at his friend Cole ' s , and that she was come in herself for the Stilton cheese , the north Wiltshire , the butter , the cellery , the beet - root , and all the dessert .
And Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would hear her in any thing else .
I shall think you a great blockhead , Frank , if you bring the aunt without the niece ."
Was not she the whole day with you ?"
Emma was quite at a loss .
" The clerks grow expert from habit .-- They must begin with some quickness of sight and hand , and exercise improves them .
She would have ordered the carriage , and come to you , but she must see you _alone_ , and that you know --( nodding towards her father )-- Humph !-- Can you come ?"
It was to be a whole - length in water - colours , like Mr . John Knightley ' s , and was destined , if she could please herself , to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece .
cried Emma , " this has been a most unfortunate -- most deplorable mistake !-- What is to be done ?"
" We can finish this some other time , you know .
You will not like staying late .
She rose early , and wrote her letter to Harriet ; an employment which left her so very serious , so nearly sad , that Mr . Knightley , in walking up to Hartfield to breakfast , did not arrive at all too soon ; and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him , literally and figuratively , was quite necessary to reinstate her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before .
The word was _blunder_ ; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it , there was a blush on Jane ' s cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible .
It was felt as such things must be felt .
Another room of much better size might be secured for the purpose ; but it was at the other end of the house , and a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it .
made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some pages ago already .
Till now that she was threatened with its loss , Emma had never known how much of her happiness depended on being _first_ with Mr . Knightley , first in interest and affection .-- Satisfied that it was so , and feeling it her due , she had enjoyed it without reflection ; and only in the dread of being supplanted , found how inexpressibly important it had been .-- Long , very long , she felt she had been first ; for , having no female connexions of his own , there had been only Isabella whose claims could be compared with hers , and she had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed Isabella .
I saw her as I came in ; she was standing in the entrance .
I dare say there was a difference when I was staying with them the other day .
" Well , Miss Woodhouse ," said Harriet , when they had quitted the house , and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin ; " Well , Miss Woodhouse , ( with a gentle sigh ,) what do you think of her ?-- Is not she very charming ?"
He loved to have the cloth laid , because it had been the fashion of his youth , but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it ; and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing , his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat .
I am thwarted in every thing material .
I am sure you did not much expect to like us .
Mr . Elton , who might marry any body !
I have really for some time past , for at least these three months , cared nothing about him .
I say , Jane , what a perfect character you and I should make , if we could be shaken together .
That she was not immediately ready , Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves ; she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion ; she must reason herself into the power of performance ; and Emma could not but pity such feelings , whatever their origin , and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again .
I am sure they will like her extremely ; and when she gets a little acquainted with them , her fears will completely wear off , for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliating .-- I shall have her very often indeed while they are with me , and I dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in the barouche - landau in some of our exploring parties ."
What totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house from what she had brought out !-- she had then been only daring to hope for a little respite of suffering ;-- she was now in an exquisite flutter of happiness , and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away .
" I am afraid we must be running away ," said Emma , glancing at Harriet , and beginning to rise --" My father will be expecting us .
He may be sure of every woman ' s approbation while he writes with such gallantry ."
here ' s Miss Woodhouse .-- Dear Miss Woodhouse , how do you do ?-- Very well I thank you , quite well .
He listened in perfect silence .
He went to town on business three days ago , and I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting to send to John .-- He delivered these papers to John , at his chambers , and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley ' s .
It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball , which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy .-- She was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the Eltons , and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike ; and his praise of Harriet , his concession in her favour , was peculiarly gratifying .
They are good - natured people , and think little of their own claims ; but still they must feel that any body ' s hurrying away is no great compliment ; and Miss Woodhouse ' s doing it would be more thought of than any other person ' s in the room .
It was Miss Taylor ' s loss which first brought grief .
I have a very sincere interest in Emma .
She had given them neither men , nor names , nor places , that could raise a blush .
Emma restrained her indignation , and only turned from her in silence .
" Oh !"
Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who were the parents , but Harriet could not tell .
I love to look at her ; and I will add this praise , that I do not think her personally vain .
CHAPTER XVIII
Mrs . Weston ' s partiality for him is very great , and , as you may suppose , most gratifying to me .
I smile because you smile , and shall probably suspect whatever I find you suspect ; but at present I do not see what there is to question .
Or Miss Bates ?
One thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely satisfactory to Emma -- its being fixed for a day within the granted term of Frank Churchill ' s stay in Surry ; for , in spite of Mr . Weston ' s confidence , she could not think it so very impossible that the Churchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his fortnight .
.
They had been speaking of it as they walked about Highbury the day before , and Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence .
