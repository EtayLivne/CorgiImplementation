At present , there was nothing to be done for Harriet ; good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible on Emma ' s side .
You have made yourself too clear .
Mrs . Weston added , " that he could only allow himself time to hurry to Highbury , after breakfast , and take leave of the few friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him ; and that he might be expected at Hartfield very soon ."
For her own sake she could not be rude ; and for Harriet ' s , in the hope that all would yet turn out right , she was even positively civil ; but it was an effort ; especially as something was going on amongst the others , in the most overpowering period of Mr . Elton ' s nonsense , which she particularly wished to listen to .
She had a moment ' s fear of Miss Bates keeping away from her .
She did not repent what she had done ; she still thought herself a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be ; but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general , which made her dislike having it so loudly against her ; and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state , was very disagreeable .
Selina , who is mild almost to a fault , bore with them much better ."
Now , as her objection was nothing but her very great dislike of Mrs . Elton , of which Mr . Weston must already be perfectly aware , it was not worth bringing forward again :-- it could not be done without a reproof to him , which would be giving pain to his wife ; and she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she would have done a great deal to avoid ; an arrangement which would probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of Mrs . Elton ' s party !
I want a change .
" What news do you mean ?"
Put it up , put it up ; we will have a good talk about it some other time , but it will not do now .
Her regard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him , and her regrets kept alive , and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss Hawkins ' s happiness , and continual observation of , how much he seemed attached !-- his air as he walked by the house -- the very sitting of his hat , being all in proof of how much he was in love !
She resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at Hartfield .
" I am sure William Larkins will not like it .
The Eltons walked together ; Mr . Knightley took charge of Miss Bates and Jane ; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill .
This letter , however , was written , and sealed , and sent .
You may be very sure that if I had , I should have cautioned you accordingly ."
If it was not for the drawback of her illness -- but I am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin , and looking very poorly .
" I dare say ," replied Mrs . Weston , smiling , " that I thought so _then_ ;-- but since we have parted , I can never remember Emma ' s omitting to do any thing I wished ."
` If you must go , my dear ,' said I , ` you must , and I will say you are laid down upon the bed .'"
" They told me -- that Mr . Martin dined with them last Saturday ."
I do not know who would ever look at him in the company of the other .
My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the table spread in the dining - room .
" Yes , papa , it is written out in our second page .
Mr . Weston is really as kind as herself .
said she .
Thank ye , the gloves do very well -- only a little too large about the wrist ; but Jane is taking them in ."
He had his shepherd ' s son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her .
" It was her very particular friend , you know ."
She read the concluding lines , and was all flutter and happiness .
You would not think it to look at him , but he is bilious -- Mr . Cole is very bilious .
She had no sense of superiority then .
It is not likely that I _should_ , considering what I have been used to .
The day approached , the day arrived ; and after a morning of some anxious watching , Frank Churchill , in all the certainty of his own self , reached Randalls before dinner , and every thing was safe .
It is a mere nothing after all ; and not the least draught from the stairs ."
--" The best of all .
The anxious cares , the incessant attentions of Mrs . Weston , were not thrown away .
We are growing a little too nice .
Every body was punctual , every body in their best looks : not a tear , and hardly a long face to be seen .
At the same time , I will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint , because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing before I am aware .
" My dear Emma ," said he at last , with earnest kindness , " do you think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of ?"
said she .
CHAPTER VIII
You should not have done it , indeed you should not .
I managed it extremely well ."
" Very true , my love , very true .
Weston , tell me at once .-- Something has happened in Brunswick Square .
Acquit me here , and procure for me , when it is allowable , the acquittal and good wishes of that said Emma Woodhouse , whom I regard with so much brotherly affection , as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself .-- Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight , you have now a key to .
His perception of the striking improvement of Harriet ' s manner , since her introduction at Hartfield , was not one of the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment .
A young _woman_ , if she fall into bad hands , may be teazed , and kept at a distance from those she wants to be with ; but one cannot comprehend a young _man_ ' s being under such restraint , as not to be able to spend a week with his father , if he likes it ."
" You must make my apologies to your friend ; but so good a charade must not be confined to one or two .
These feelings rapidly restored his comfort , while Mrs . Weston , of a more apprehensive disposition , foresaw nothing but a repetition of excuses and delays ; and after all her concern for what her husband was to suffer , suffered a great deal more herself .
Such expressions , assisted as they were by every thing that look and manner could do , made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet so well , nor valued her affection so highly before .
I will move a little farther off ."
Nobody , who has not been in the interior of a family , can say what the difficulties of any individual of that family may be .
I have a great deal of vivacity in my own way , but I really must be allowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue .
" Why should you caution me ?-- You do not think I care about Mr . Frank Churchill ."
Still , however , affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment .
Of all the sources of evil surrounding the former , since her coming to Highbury , she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst .
Apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception , and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and Mr . Weston , must necessarily open the cause ; but when these effusions were put by , they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state of the engagement .
Soft is the very word for her eye -- of all epithets , the justest that could be given .
" You think I ought to refuse him then ," said Harriet , looking down .
There is no admiration between them , I do assure you ; and the appearances which have caught you , have arisen from some peculiar circumstances -- feelings rather of a totally different nature -- it is impossible exactly to explain :-- there is a good deal of nonsense in it -- but the part which is capable of being communicated , which is sense , is , that they are as far from any attachment or admiration for one another , as any two beings in the world can be .
" Only think !
I always make a point of reading Jane ' s letters through to myself first , before I read them aloud to my mother , you know , for fear of there being any thing in them to distress her .
Mr . Knightley saw no such passion , and of course thought nothing of its effects ; but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest ; and more than a reasonable , becoming degree of prudence , she was very sure did not belong to Mr . Elton .
They would catch worse colds at the Crown than anywhere ."
I honour that part of the attention particularly ; it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart .
What is all this ?"
Miss Hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a Bristol -- merchant , of course , he must be called ; but , as the whole of the profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate , it was not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very moderate also .
He sat a little while in doubt .
It makes me envious and miserable ;-- I who have never seen it !
" Well , Emma , I do not believe I have any thing more to say about the boys ; but you have your sister ' s letter , and every thing is down at full length there we may be sure .
She soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs . Elton ' s thoughts , and understand why she was , like herself , in happy spirits ; it was being in Miss Fairfax ' s confidence , and fancying herself acquainted with what was still a secret to other people .
" You were speaking ," said he , gravely .
no -- I never conceived you could become indifferent .
She saw it all ; and entering into her feelings , promoted her quitting the house immediately , and watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend .
for I know gentlemen do not like morning visits , and Mr . Elton ' s time is so engaged ."
A _Mrs . _ _Elton_ would be an excuse for any change of intercourse ; former intimacy might sink without remark .
Emma was delighted , and only wanted him to go on in the same style ; but his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own Jane , and his next words were ,
This appeal to her affections did more than all the rest .
While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to myself , but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation in approving .
Mr . Knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure ;-- not like Mr . Elton .
" Dear me !-- it is so odd to hear a woman talk so !"
Knightley .-- They had determined that their marriage ought to be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield , to allow them the fortnight ' s absence in a tour to the seaside , which was the plan .-- John and Isabella , and every other friend , were agreed in approving it .
She never stopt till she had gone through the whole ; and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong , yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed -- and he had suffered , and was very sorry -- and he was so grateful to Mrs . Weston , and so much in love with Miss Fairfax , and she was so happy herself , that there was no being severe ; and could he have entered the room , she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever .
" If we were in the other room ," said Emma , " if I had my writing - desk , I am sure I could produce a specimen .
She saw in a moment all the possible good .
He stopped .-- Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs . Weston , and did not herself know what to think .
It seemed the best scheme ; and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted a better .
I think , Emma , I shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us .
" I was very often influenced rightly by you -- oftener than I would own at the time .
-- And from her great , her more than commonly thankful delight towards Mrs . Elton for being there , Emma guessed that there had been a little show of resentment towards Jane , from the vicarage quarter , which was now graciously overcome .-- After a few whispers , indeed , which placed it beyond a guess , Mrs . Elton , speaking louder , said ,
Jane ' s solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped Emma .
He could not see her in a situation of such danger , without trying to preserve her .
She was so eager to have them drawn that I could not refuse ; but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know ; nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them , beyond the air and complexion , unless they are coarser featured than any of mama ' s children ever were .
It would be an interesting , and certainly a very kind undertaking ; highly becoming her own situation in life , her leisure , and powers .
Some laughed , and answered good - humouredly .
" Come , come ," cried Emma , feeling this to be an unsafe subject , " I must beg you not to talk of the sea .
English verdure , English culture , English comfort , seen under a sun bright , without being oppressive .
