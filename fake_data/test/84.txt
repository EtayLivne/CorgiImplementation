This had just taken place and with great cordiality , when John Knightley made his appearance , and " How d ' ye do , George ?"
" And make her like myself ."
She understood their ways , could allow for their ignorance and their temptations , had no romantic expectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had done so little ; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy , and always gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good - will .
" She will not be surprized , papa , at least ."
Oh !-- you need not be afraid of owning it to me , for Mr . Weston has told me himself .
no "-- and Emma could just catch the words , " so superior to Mr .
Then the baked apples came home , Mrs . Wallis sent them by her boy ; they are extremely civil and obliging to us , the Wallises , always -- I have heard some people say that Mrs . Wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer , but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention from them .
If you wish me to talk to Mrs . Hodges , or to inspect anything --"
I assure you I began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous .
" The joke ," he replied gravely , " seemed confined to you and Mr .
Such events are very interesting , but the suspense of them cannot last long .
You have made yourself too clear .
" I must not dwell upon it ," said she .--" I must not think of it .
She must have delighted the Coles -- worthy people , who deserved to be made happy !-- And left a name behind her that would not soon die away .
I wanted to keep it from Jane ' s knowledge ; but , unluckily , I had mentioned it before I was aware ."
It was but an effusion of lively spirits .
There are places in town , offices , where inquiry would soon produce something -- Offices for the sale -- not quite of human flesh -- but of human intellect ."
And Frank Churchill was heard to say , " I think you could manage this without effort ; the first part is so very trifling .
Mr . Elton made his appearance .
We do not often look upon fine young men , well - bred and agreeable .
" Your parish there was small ," said Jane .
Harriet was very ready to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening games ; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good - humoured and obliging .
It is a pity that they were ever got over ."
cried Mr . Elton , " what can be the meaning of this ?-- Miss Smith !-- I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my existence -- never paid her any attentions , but as your friend : never cared whether she were dead or alive , but as your friend .
Mr . Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled ; but the worst was overcome , the idea was given ; time and continual repetition must do the rest .-- To Emma ' s entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr . Knightley ' s , whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome ; and he was soon used to be talked to by each , on every fair occasion .-- They had all the assistance which Isabella could give , by letters of the strongest approbation ; and Mrs . Weston was ready , on the first meeting , to consider the subject in the most serviceable light -- first , as a settled , and , secondly , as a good one -- well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to Mr . Woodhouse ' s mind .-- It was agreed upon , as what was to be ; and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness ; and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it , he began to think that some time or other -- in another year or two , perhaps -- it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place .
While poor Mrs . Churchill lived , I suppose there could not have been a hope , a chance , a possibility ;-- but scarcely are her remains at rest in the family vault , than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required .
Jane said so .
But I do not understand how the room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father ' s house ."
I have no faith in Mrs . Elton ' s acknowledging herself the inferior in thought , word , or deed ; or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good - breeding .
" Have I ?"
" Harriet !"
You will look back and see that I did not come till Miss Fairfax was in Highbury ; and as _you_ were the person slighted , you will forgive me instantly ; but I must work on my father ' s compassion , by reminding him , that so long as I absented myself from his house , so long I lost the blessing of knowing you .
papa -- that is what you never have been able to accomplish , and I do not think you ever will .
She was so eager to have them drawn that I could not refuse ; but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know ; nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them , beyond the air and complexion , unless they are coarser featured than any of mama ' s children ever were .
" Oh !
An injunction of secresy had been among Mr . Weston ' s parting words .
" You are not quite so miserable , though , as when you first came .
I wanted them to put off the wedding ."
He had turned away , and the horses were in motion .
Mrs . Weston , with her baby on her knee , indulging in such reflections as these , was one of the happiest women in the world .
As a magistrate , he had generally some point of law to consult John about , or , at least , some curious anecdote to give ; and as a farmer , as keeping in hand the home - farm at Donwell , he had to tell what every field was to bear next year , and to give all such local information as could not fail of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his life , and whose attachments were strong .
The grounds of Hartfield were small , but neat and pretty ; and the house was modern and well - built .
aye , I know your scruples .
It would be almost beginning their life of civility again .
Emma was extremely confused .
Let me not suppose that she dares go about , Emma Woodhouse - ing me !-- But upon my honour , there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman ' s tongue !"
From that moment , Emma could have taken her oath that Mr . Knightley had had no concern in giving the instrument .
Frank comes to - morrow -- I had a letter this morning -- we see him to - morrow by dinner - time to a certainty -- he is at Oxford to - day , and he comes for a whole fortnight ; I knew it would be so .
" Agreed , agreed .
" I am afraid Jane is not very well ," said she , " but I do not know ; they _tell_ me she is well .
Keep your raptures for Harriet ' s face .
She has not the least idea ."
No , the young lady , to be sure .
If Mr . Knightley did not begin seriously , he was obliged to proceed so , for his proposal was caught at with delight ; and the " Oh !
Where I have a regard , I always think a person well - looking .
" I have no doubt of its being our carriage with Miss Bates and Jane .
for , if we had met first in the drawing - room , I doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual .-- You might not have distinguished how I came , by my look or manner ."
Dear Jane , how shall we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama ?
She was very fond of singing .
Her parting look was grateful -- and her parting words , " Oh !
The weather added what it could of gloom .
She could never quit him ."
He was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself , she just recovering from her mania for Mr . Elton .
" It would be very hard , indeed , my dear , if poor Isabella were to be anywhere but at Hartfield ."
-- But , in spite of these deficiencies , the wishes , the hopes , the confidence , the predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the ceremony , were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union .
" Dear me !-- How should I ever have borne it !
His gallantry was always on the alert .
-- Even Mr . Weston shook his head , and looked solemn , and said , " Ah !
here ' s Miss Woodhouse .-- Dear Miss Woodhouse , how do you do ?-- Very well I thank you , quite well .
" I dare say ," returned Harriet , sighing again , " I dare say she was very much attached to him ."
Miss Nash had told her all this , and had talked a great deal more about Mr . Elton ; and said , looking so very significantly at her , " that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be , but she only knew that any woman whom Mr . Elton could prefer , she should think the luckiest woman in the world ; for , beyond a doubt , Mr . Elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness ."
It will do you good to speak of your distress , whatever it may be ."
" What !"
" It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to , if Mr . and Mrs . Weston do not .
Dining once with the Coles -- and having a ball talked of , which never took place .
But what shall I say ?
Knightley ' s .-- Alas !
At the same time , nobody could wonder if Mr . Elton should have aspired -- Miss Woodhouse lets me chatter on , so good - humouredly .
She knows their ways best ; but I should not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present .
" Whatever you say is always right ," cried Harriet , " and therefore I suppose , and believe , and hope it must be so ; but otherwise I could not have imagined it .
Mr . Weston , you must really have had Aladdin ' s lamp .
I think there is a little likeness between us ."
" We allowed unnecessary room .
" Take it ," said Emma , smiling , and pushing the paper towards Harriet --" it is for you .
Emma was silenced .
Emma understood him ; and as soon as she could recover from the flutter of pleasure , excited by such tender consideration , replied ,
Had she followed Mr . Knightley ' s known wishes , in paying that attention to Miss Fairfax , which was every way her due ; had she tried to know her better ; had she done her part towards intimacy ; had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith ; she must , in all probability , have been spared from every pain which pressed on her now .-- Birth , abilities , and education , had been equally marking one as an associate for her , to be received with gratitude ; and the other -- what was she ?-- Supposing even that they had never become intimate friends ; that she had never been admitted into Miss Fairfax ' s confidence on this important matter -- which was most probable -- still , in knowing her as she ought , and as she might , she must have been preserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr . Dixon , which she had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself , but had so unpardonably imparted ; an idea which she greatly feared had been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane ' s feelings , by the levity or carelessness of Frank Churchill ' s .
" One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of a school , Harriet .
There has been a solemn engagement between them ever since October -- formed at Weymouth , and kept a secret from every body .
Look at her .
A young _woman_ , if she fall into bad hands , may be teazed , and kept at a distance from those she wants to be with ; but one cannot comprehend a young _man_ ' s being under such restraint , as not to be able to spend a week with his father , if he likes it ."
They combated the point some time longer in the same way ; Emma rather gaining ground over the mind of her friend ; for Mrs . Weston was the most used of the two to yield ; till a little bustle in the room shewed them that tea was over , and the instrument in preparation ;-- and at the same moment Mr . Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse would do them the honour of trying it .
" I either depend more upon Emma ' s good sense than you do , or am more anxious for her present comfort ; for I cannot lament the acquaintance .
you clever creature , that ' s very true .
cried Emma , not attending to her .--" Mrs .
Why does not Perry see her ?"
With such sensations , Mr . Elton ' s civilities were dreadfully ill - timed ; but she had the comfort of appearing very polite , while feeling very cross -- and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again , or the substance of it , from the open - hearted Mr .
" No -- I shall not stir .
They walked on .
after the note I sent him this morning , and the message he returned , that he should certainly be at home till one ."
