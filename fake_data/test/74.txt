" But really , I am half ashamed , and wish I had never taken up the idea ."
You were very popular before you came , because you were Mr . Weston ' s son -- but lay out half a guinea at Ford ' s , and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues ."
" Well , I cannot understand it ."
The affection of such a man as Mr . Elton would have been too great a distinction .-- She never could have deserved him -- and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse would have thought it possible .
The mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr . Elton .
Often as she had wished for and ordered it , she had never been able to get any thing tolerable .
She thinks nobody equal to him ."
my dear sir , how are you this morning ?
" Thank you for rousing me ," he replied .
regular features , open countenance , with a complexion !
What are they saying about Mr .
They seemed more like cheerful , easy friends , than lovers .
He did so , but very soon stopt again to say , " the pianoforte !
Of very important , very recordable events , it was not more productive than such meetings usually are .
it gives one exactly the idea of such a height as Miss Smith ' s .
" There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart ," said she afterwards to herself .
" Yes -- what should hurt me ?-- I walk fast .
She is still nearer .-- And I do not know whether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body .
said Emma .
It is very difficult for the prosperous to be humble .
The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates .
Good old Mrs . Bates -- I will call upon her to - morrow , and take my children .-- They are always so pleased to see my children .-- And that excellent Miss Bates !-- such thorough worthy people !-- How are they , sir ?"
Emma , who was not really at all frightened herself , tranquillised this excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs . Goddard ' s experience and care ; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she could not wish to reason away , which she would rather feed and assist than not , she added soon afterwards -- as if quite another subject ,
Forcing herself to speak , therefore , in the hope of putting it by , she calmly said ,
replied he .
Mrs . Elton left them no choice .
Long before he reappeared , attending the short , neat , brisk - moving aunt , and her elegant niece ,-- Mrs . Weston , like a sweet - tempered woman and a good wife , had examined the passage again , and found the evils of it much less than she had supposed before -- indeed very trifling ; and here ended the difficulties of decision .
She allowed him to talk , and arranged the glasses , and wrapped herself up , without opening her lips .
My mother is delightfully well ; and Jane caught no cold last night .
Mr . Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury , and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed , though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life .
But then Patty came in , and said it was you .
Mr . Perry could not quite understand him , but he was very sure there must be a _lady_ in the case , and he told him so ; and Mr . Elton only looked very conscious and smiling , and rode off in great spirits .
I would not have you too sanguine ; though , however it may end , be assured your raising your thoughts to _him_ , is a mark of good taste which I shall always know how to value ."
do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax ' s sensations from you , or from any body else .
I feel a strong persuasion , this morning , that I shall soon be abroad .
This event had very lately taken place ; too lately for any thing to be yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path of duty ; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had fixed on for beginning .
I have thought only of you .
He was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern .
Warmth and tenderness of heart , with an affectionate , open manner , will beat all the clearness of head in the world , for attraction , I am sure it will .
I have no reason to think ill of her -- not the least -- except that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner , such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body , is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal ."
Depend upon it , he will be much farther from doing _you_ justice .
Her heart had been long growing kinder towards Jane ; and this picture of her present sufferings acted as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion , and left her nothing but pity ; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of the past , obliged her to admit that Jane might very naturally resolve on seeing Mrs . Cole or any other steady friend , when she might not bear to see herself .
" Your gallantry is really unanswerable .
Emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment .
" He is very young to settle ," was Mr . Woodhouse ' s observation .
At Hartfield , you have had very good specimens of well educated , well bred men .
You made a lucky guess ; and _that_ is all that can be said ."
The difference which Randalls , Randalls alone makes in your goings - on , is very great ."
It was short , but expressed good sense , warm attachment , liberality , propriety , even delicacy of feeling .
Emma ' s answer was ready at the first word .
Mr . Weston seems an excellent creature -- quite a first - rate favourite with me already , I assure you .
We shall be most happy to consider you as one of the party ."
" No , no , that ' s to - morrow ; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley to - day on that very account .-- Such a dreadful broiling morning !-- I went over the fields too --( speaking in a tone of great ill - usage ,) which made it so much the worse .
Weston .-- So it proved ;-- for when happily released from Mr . Elton , and seated by Mr . Weston , at dinner , he made use of the very first interval in the cares of hospitality , the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton , to say to her ,
The young ladies of Highbury might have walked again in safety before their panic began , and the whole history dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to Emma and her nephews :-- in her imagination it maintained its ground , and Henry and John were still asking every day for the story of Harriet and the gipsies , and still tenaciously setting her right if she varied in the slightest particular from the original recital .
for I think you have a little cold , and Patty has been washing the kitchen .'--` Oh !
My dear sir , you really are too bountiful .
Elton ?"
" I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind ; but excuse me , Mr . Knightley , if I take the liberty ( I consider myself , you know , as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma ' s mother might have had ) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith ' s intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you .
" Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of ?"
Very thoughtful of Colonel Campbell , was not it ?-- He knew Miss Fairfax could have no music here .
He was silent .
There , not to be vulgar , was distinction , and merit .
It was dreadfully mortifying ; but Mr . Elton was proving himself , in many respects , the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him ; proud , assuming , conceited ; very full of his own claims , and little concerned about the feelings of others .
And dear Emma , too !-- What a dreadful loss to you both !-- I have been so grieved for you .-- I could not imagine how you could possibly do without her .-- It is a sad change indeed .-- But I hope she is pretty well , sir ."
She felt it at her heart .
" If I can come again , we are still to have our ball .
She felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis , an event , a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state .
But the sight of Mr . Knightley among the most attentive , soon drew away half Emma ' s mind ; and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of Mrs . Weston ' s suspicions , to which the sweet sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions .
" But , Mr . Knightley , she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor , and I am sure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for ."
Ford .-- " Yes -- no -- yes , to Mrs . Goddard ' s .
He must have had a wet ride .-- Yes .-- He meant to walk with her , she found .
Time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circle -- but that is not the change I had in view for you .
And the distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first ; for a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind , and sour the temper .
" That you do not give another half - second to the subject .
" As to who , or what Miss Hawkins is , or how long he has been acquainted with her ," said Emma , " nothing I suppose can be known .
" Such things do occur , undoubtedly ."
Under that peculiar sort of dry , blunt manner , I know you have the warmest heart .
I always say , we are quite blessed in our neighbours .-- My dear sir , if there is one thing my mother loves better than another , it is pork -- a roast loin of pork --"
" No ," cried Mr . Knightley , " that need not be the consequence .
Mr . Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe , which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command , as well as the route and the method of his journey ; and she listened , and smiled , and congratulated .
cried Emma feelingly .
how could it be ?-- Then I must have dreamt it -- but I was completely persuaded -- Miss Smith , you walk as if you were tired .
The possibility of the young man ' s coming to Mrs . Goddard ' s that morning , and meeting with Harriet and pleading his own cause , gave alarming ideas .
Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent , which no doubt he was in the habit of receiving , to emulate the " Very true , my love ," which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion ; but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer at all .
Mr . Elton had retreated into the card - room , looking ( Emma trusted ) very foolish .
But what did such particulars explain ?-- The fact was , as Emma could now acknowledge , that Harriet had always liked Robert Martin ; and that his continuing to love her had been irresistible .-- Beyond this , it must ever be unintelligible to Emma .
` Oh !'
Married women , you know , may be safely authorised .
` Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself !'
And as it is some months since Miss Campbell married , the impression may be a little worn off ."
or is it too short ?"
" Will you be so kind ," said she , " when I am missed , as to say that I am gone home ?-- I am going this moment .-- My aunt is not aware how late it is , nor how long we have been absent -- but I am sure we shall be wanted , and I am determined to go directly .-- I have said nothing about it to any body .
or a shark ?
She would not be in a hurry to find fault , but she suspected that there was no elegance ;-- ease , but not elegance .-- She was almost sure that for a young woman , a stranger , a bride , there was too much ease .
This wretched note was the finale of Emma ' s breakfast .
I am sure she will be as happy to see her friends at Highbury , as they can be to see her .
" I cannot name a day ," said he , " till I have spoken to some others whom I would wish to meet you ."
There was no time for farther remark or explanation .
Good Mrs . Stokes would not know her own room again .
