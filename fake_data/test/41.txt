cried Mr . Knightley .
I always stand up for women -- and I assure you , if you knew how Selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn , you would not wonder at Mrs . Churchill ' s making incredible exertions to avoid it .
" The Churchills are very likely in fault ," said Mr . Knightley , coolly ; " but I dare say he might come if he would ."
We never see any thing of it on our club - nights ."
no , indeed ; I must protest against any such idea .
And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my three turns -- my winter walk ."
I managed it extremely well ."
She blessed the favouring blindness .
said Emma , as she turned back into the hall again .
She was sensible of all the affection it evinced .
The acquaintance at present had no charm for her .
" She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there .
" It is too much a matter of fact , but here it is .-- What two letters of the alphabet are there , that express perfection ?"
I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , it is very delightful to me , to be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial to as Maple Grove .
I see the difference plain enough .
Emma , this is your doing .
He stopped .-- Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply .
How do you do , Mr .
" Yes , do ."
" I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy ," said Mr . Knightley presently , " though I have kept my thoughts to myself ; but I now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet .
As Frank Churchill ' s arrival had succeeded Mr . Elton ' s engagement in the conversation of Highbury , as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first , so now upon Frank Churchill ' s disappearance , Mr . Elton ' s concerns were assuming the most irresistible form .-- His wedding - day was named .
" I have very little to say for my own conduct .-- I was tempted by his attentions , and allowed myself to appear pleased .-- An old story , probably -- a common case -- and no more than has happened to hundreds of my sex before ; and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up as I do for Understanding .
I wonder what will become of her !"
My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well .
Or , perhaps she may not have resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life .
I thought -- but I beg your pardon , perhaps I have been under a mistake .
What totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house from what she had brought out !-- she had then been only daring to hope for a little respite of suffering ;-- she was now in an exquisite flutter of happiness , and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away .
And as it is some months since Miss Campbell married , the impression may be a little worn off ."
He rode down for a couple of hours ; he could not yet do more ; but as he came from Randalls immediately to Hartfield , she could then exercise all her quick observation , and speedily determine how he was influenced , and how she must act .
He was a married man , with only one living child , a girl , about Jane ' s age : and Jane became their guest , paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all ; and before she was nine years old , his daughter ' s great fondness for her , and his own wish of being a real friend , united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her education .
.
Mr . Weston would take no denial ; they must all dine at Randalls one day ;-- even Mr . Woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of the party .
Poor Mr . Woodhouse trembled as he sat , and , as Emma had foreseen , would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again .
They had been arrived only a few minutes , and Mr . Weston had scarcely finished his explanation of Frank ' s being a day before his time , and her father was yet in the midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations , when she appeared , to have her share of surprize , introduction , and pleasure .
" Come ," said he , " you are anxious for a compliment , so I will tell you that you have improved her .
no -- what an impudent dog I was !-- How could I dare --"
Mrs . Weston , with her baby on her knee , indulging in such reflections as these , was one of the happiest women in the world .
She thought it was time to make up .
Can I do any thing for _you_ ?"
So I begged he would not -- for really as to ours being gone , I could not absolutely say that we had a great many left -- it was but half a dozen indeed ; but they should be all kept for Jane ; and I could not at all bear that he should be sending us more , so liberal as he had been already ; and Jane said the same .
She was his object , and every body must perceive it .
You do not know what it is to have tempers to manage ."
At her age she can have no experience , and with her little wit , is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her .
She has now been a longer time stationary there , than she ever was before , and she begins to want change .
If we were obliged to go out such an evening as this , by any call of duty or business , what a hardship we should deem it ;-- and here are we , probably with rather thinner clothing than usual , setting forward voluntarily , without excuse , in defiance of the voice of nature , which tells man , in every thing given to his view or his feelings , to stay at home himself , and keep all under shelter that he can ;-- here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another man ' s house , with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard yesterday , and may not be said and heard again to - morrow .
Mr . Weston must be quiet , and every thing deliberately arranged .
Did not I tell you what he said of you the other day ?"
" Well ," said she at last , trying to recover herself ; " this is a circumstance which I must think of at least half a day , before I can at all comprehend it .
But , on the other hand , she could not admit herself to be unhappy , nor , after the first morning , to be less disposed for employment than usual ; she was still busy and cheerful ; and , pleasing as he was , she could yet imagine him to have faults ; and farther , though thinking of him so much , and , as she sat drawing or working , forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment , fancying interesting dialogues , and inventing elegant letters ; the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she _refused_ _him_ .
The party was rather large , as it included one other family , a proper unobjectionable country family , whom the Coles had the advantage of naming among their acquaintance , and the male part of Mr . Cox ' s family , the lawyer of Highbury .
" Oh !
He sat a little while in doubt .
" You talk a great deal of the length of this passage , my dear .
As it was , I was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit .
" I suppose you have heard of the handsome letter Mr . Frank Churchill has written to Mrs . Weston ?
He called for a few moments , just to leave a piece of paper on the table containing , as he said , a charade , which a friend of his had addressed to a young lady , the object of his admiration , but which , from his manner , Emma was immediately convinced must be his own .
Emma watched and decided , that with such feelings as were now shewn , it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting himself ; that he had not been acting a part , or making a parade of insincere professions ; and that Mr . Knightley certainly had not done him justice .
It would be an interesting , and certainly a very kind undertaking ; highly becoming her own situation in life , her leisure , and powers .
" Was he agreeable ?"
cried Harriet , colouring , and astonished .
Emma returned her friend ' s pressure with interest ; and was pleased enough to exclaim ,
Poverty certainly has not contracted her mind : I really believe , if she had only a shilling in the world , she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it ; and nobody is afraid of her : that is a great charm ."
I am making a conundrum .
" Very well ," replied Emma ; " a most natural feeling ; and the longer it lasts , the better I shall be pleased .
I feel that all the apologies should be on my side .
We never heard of such things at Maple Grove ."
poor Harriet !"
Let me recommend Bath to you .
John Knightley ' s being a lawyer is very inconvenient .-- Poor Isabella !-- she is sadly taken away from us all !-- and how sorry she will be when she comes , not to see Miss Taylor here !"
Do not let me lose it .
Either bathing has been of the greatest service to her , or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of Mr . Wingfield ' s , which we have been applying at times ever since August ."
yes "-- he replied ; " I was just going to mention it .
Ambition , as well as love , had probably been mortified .
She was obliged to repeat and explain it , before it was fully comprehended ; and then , being quite new , farther representations were necessary to make it acceptable .
She was not less pleased another day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers , to have Harriet ' s picture .
He seemed to be almost asking her , whether her affections were engaged .-- But as soon as she ( Miss Woodhouse ) appeared likely to join them , he changed the subject , and began talking about farming :-- The second , was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour before Emma came back from her visit , the very last morning of his being at Hartfield -- though , when he first came in , he had said that he could not stay five minutes -- and his having told her , during their conversation , that though he must go to London , it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all , which was much more ( as Emma felt ) than he had acknowledged to _her_ .
" I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love ."
It was a done thing ; Mr . Elton was to go , and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment ; never had his smile been stronger , nor his eyes more exulting than when he next looked at her .
that I had never seen her !"
Mr . Knightley , I wish you had the benefit of this ; I think this would convince you .
After Emma had talked about it for ten minutes , Mr . Woodhouse felt no unwillingness , and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself , with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him .
Oh !
After the first chat of pleasure he was silent ; and then , in a graver tone , began with ,
It would be a _secret_ satisfaction ; but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any thing Jane might communicate .
And as it is some months since Miss Campbell married , the impression may be a little worn off ."
" You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates ," said Emma .
If you do not call early it will be a slight ."
CHAPTER III
" He is a most fortunate man !"
She did most heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhood -- and sat down and practised vigorously an hour and a half .
But now , poor girl , her peace is cut up for some time .
Perhaps it is paid already .
And , by the bye , can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion ?-- Pray be sincere , Knightley .
` Can I do any thing for you at Kingston ?'
As to myself , I am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings -- Nothing could be farther from my wishes -- your attachment to my friend Harriet -- your pursuit of her , ( pursuit , it appeared ,) gave me great pleasure , and I have been very earnestly wishing you success : but had I supposed that she were not your attraction to Hartfield , I should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent .
Emma ' s comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on , by Harriet ' s being to stay longer ; her fortnight was likely to be a month at least .
Do not pity me till I saw her wan , sick looks .-- I reached Highbury at the time of day when , from my knowledge of their late breakfast hour , I was certain of a good chance of finding her alone .-- I was not disappointed ; and at last I was not disappointed either in the object of my journey .
She comforted her father better than she could comfort herself , by representing that though he certainly would make them nine , yet he always said so little , that the increase of noise would be very immaterial .
" It is very unfair to judge of any body ' s conduct , without an intimate knowledge of their situation .
I rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness than I deserve .
