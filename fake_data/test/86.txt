CHAPTER XI
They were soon joined by some of the gentlemen ; and the very first of the early was Frank Churchill .
She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith ' s conversation , but she found her altogether very engaging -- not inconveniently shy , not unwilling to talk -- and yet so far from pushing , shewing so proper and becoming a deference , seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to Hartfield , and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to , that she must have good sense , and deserve encouragement .
Poor little dears , how glad they will be to come .
" But , my dear papa , it is supposed to be summer ; a warm day in summer .
" No , no , that ' s to - morrow ; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley to - day on that very account .-- Such a dreadful broiling morning !-- I went over the fields too --( speaking in a tone of great ill - usage ,) which made it so much the worse .
He felt the going away almost too much to speak of it .
I always fetch the letters when I am here .
at present I ask no more ."
I come in for a pretty good share as a second .
Jane said so .
But with all the hopes of cheerfulness , and all the present comfort of delay , there was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with Harriet , as made it impossible for Emma to be ever perfectly at ease .
repeated Mrs . Elton .
And when I brought out the baked apples from the closet , and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to take some , ` Oh !'
Poor little dears , how glad they will be to come .
" Well -- if you advise it .-- But ( with a smile ) if Colonel Campbell should have employed a careless friend , and if it should prove to have an indifferent tone -- what shall I say ?
" Has he so !-- Then I know nothing of Mr . Elton .
I am sure I never suspected it , you did it so naturally ."
He recommended it for all the children , but particularly for the weakness in little Bella ' s throat ,-- both sea air and bathing ."
But we never did .
You must have heard every thing to be sure .
Now , Mr . Knightley , a word or two more , and I have done .
With all dear Emma ' s little faults , she is an excellent creature .
" If he could stay only a couple of days , he ought to come ; and one can hardly conceive a young man ' s not having it in his power to do as much as that .
He may have as strong a sense of what would be right , as you can have , without being so equal , under particular circumstances , to act up to it ."
She talked with a great deal of reason , and at least equal affection -- but she had too much to urge for Emma ' s attention ; it was soon gone to Brunswick Square or to Donwell ; she forgot to attempt to listen ; and when Mrs . Weston ended with , " We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for , you know , but I hope it will soon come ," she was obliged to pause before she answered , and at last obliged to answer at random , before she could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for .
She was vexed .
But this does not acquit _him_ , Mrs . Weston ; and I must say , that I think him greatly to blame .
But the sight of Mr . Knightley among the most attentive , soon drew away half Emma ' s mind ; and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of Mrs . Weston ' s suspicions , to which the sweet sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions .
What an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream !
Perry !-- such attention to Jane !"
My blindness to what was going on , led me to act by them in a way that I must always be ashamed of , and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures , but I have no other reason to regret that I was not in the secret earlier ."
For it is not five minutes since I received Mrs . Cole ' s note -- no , it cannot be more than five -- or at least ten -- for I had got my bonnet and spencer on , just ready to come out -- I was only gone down to speak to Patty again about the pork -- Jane was standing in the passage -- were not you , Jane ?-- for my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting - pan large enough .
asked Mr . Knightley .
I saw the word , and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one , and so very distressing to the other ."
CHAPTER XII
" Yes , simpleton as I was !-- but I am quite ashamed of it now , and wish I could forget as easily as I can burn them .
She had heard , as soon as she got back to Mrs . Goddard ' s , that Mr . Martin had been there an hour before , and finding she was not at home , nor particularly expected , had left a little parcel for her from one of his sisters , and gone away ; and on opening this parcel , she had actually found , besides the two songs which she had lent Elizabeth to copy , a letter to herself ; and this letter was from him , from Mr . Martin , and contained a direct proposal of marriage .
" I think she must be here soon ," said he .
" It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer -- but it seems a case of necessity .
One cannot love a reserved person ."
That will just do for me , you know .
you are not serious now .
" You are extremely kind ," said Jane ; " but I cannot give up my early walk .
Such was Jane Fairfax ' s history .
I bring a new proposal on the subject :-- a thought of my father ' s , which waits only your approbation to be acted upon .
He had wanted very much to go abroad -- had been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel -- but she would not hear of it .
An egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome .
He was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal , and came back all the better -- grown quite cool -- and , with good manners , like himself -- able to draw a chair close to them , take an interest in their employment ; and regret , in a reasonable way , that he should be so late .
" And I am quite serious too , I assure you ," replied Mrs . Elton gaily , " in resolving to be always on the watch , and employing my friends to watch also , that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us ."
Have you heard the news ?
But it would not do ; he had not come to the point .
" No , indeed , I shall grant you nothing .
This event had very lately taken place ; too lately for any thing to be yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path of duty ; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had fixed on for beginning .
" Oh !
" Who is that gentleman on horseback ?"
my mother ' s spectacles .
" Pretty !
Harriet listened , and Emma drew in peace .
You must be the best judge of your own happiness .
How long had Mr . Knightley been so dear to her , as every feeling declared him now to be ?
" But , unfortunately , sir , my time is so limited --"
They shew her to the greatest advantage .
Frank ' s mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her .
He thanked her with all his heart , and continued some time to speak with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness .
The contrivances of modern days indeed have rendered a gentleman ' s carriage perfectly complete .
" It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy , but I cannot believe it .
He had been most agreeable , most delightful ; he had told Harriet that he had seen them go by , and had purposely followed them ; other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt , but nothing serious .
" You may depend upon me ," said she .
No , my dear little modest Harriet , depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond - street till just before he mounts his horse to - morrow .
My daughter and I are both highly sensible of your goodness , and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield ."
I really am a most troublesome companion to you both , but I hope I am not often so ill - equipped .
Every body was punctual , every body in their best looks : not a tear , and hardly a long face to be seen .
He hesitated , got up , walked to a window .
We are to walk about your gardens , and gather the strawberries ourselves , and sit under trees ;-- and whatever else you may like to provide , it is to be all out of doors -- a table spread in the shade , you know .
And now I come to the principal , the only important part of my conduct while belonging to you , which excites my own anxiety , or requires very solicitous explanation .
But in time they will .
Now , however , it was absolutely to be ; every preparation was resumed , and very soon after the Churchills had removed to Richmond , a few lines from Frank , to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change , and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty - four hours at any given time , induced them to name as early a day as possible .
Knightley ' s words dwelt with her .
" I either depend more upon Emma ' s good sense than you do , or am more anxious for her present comfort ; for I cannot lament the acquaintance .
" You are prepared for the worst , I see -- and very bad it is .
" Yes ; if you and Mr . Woodhouse see no objection , and I trust you cannot , my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there .
" Will you read the letter ?"
" How often , when you were a girl , have you said to me , with one of your saucy looks --` Mr . Knightley , I am going to do so - and - so ; papa says I may , or I have Miss Taylor ' s leave '-- something which , you knew , I did not approve .
Do you suppose she does not often say all this to herself ?
She was his object , and every body must perceive it .
The party did not break up without Emma ' s being positively secured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening , nor without her overhearing Mr . Weston whisper to his wife , " He has asked her , my dear .
Oh no !
She gave a slight glance round the table , and applied herself to it .
very true indeed .
" And so you actually put this piece of court - plaister by for his sake !"
Mrs . Weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem .
My dear sir , you are too obliging .-- Is there nobody you would not rather ?-- I am not helpless .
" But I am afraid , Mr . Elton , Harriet will not like to sit .
" Which makes his good manners the more valuable .
.
The Coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into any great family .
" I think they will neither of them do the other any good ."
They should lose her ; and , probably , in great measure , her husband also .-- Frank Churchill would return among them no more ; and Miss Fairfax , it was reasonable to suppose , would soon cease to belong to Highbury .
All that remained to be wished was , that the nephew should form the attachment , as , with all her goodwill in the cause , Emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed .
