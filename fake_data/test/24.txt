CHAPTER XVIII
Emma thanked him , but could not allow of his disappointing his friend on their account ; her father was sure of his rubber .
Elton ?"
When I think of the kindness and favour I have met with , of her excellence and patience , and my uncle ' s generosity , I am mad with joy : but when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her , and how little I deserve to be forgiven , I am mad with anger .
Was not she like a daughter , his eldest daughter ?-- he must tell her ; and Miss Bates being present , it passed , of course , to Mrs . Cole , Mrs . Perry , and Mrs . Elton , immediately afterwards .
I was late ; I met her walking home by herself , and wanted to walk with her , but she would not suffer it .
They met readily and smiling , but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said ; and having all sat down again , there was for some time such a blank in the circle , that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged , which she had long felt , of seeing Frank Churchill once more , and of seeing him with Jane , would yield its proportion of pleasure .
" Happy couple !"
Jane and I quite ready .
" Why should you caution me ?-- You do not think I care about Mr . Frank Churchill ."
Had the same behaviour continued , Miss Smith might have been led into a misconception of your views ; not being aware , probably , any more than myself , of the very great inequality which you are so sensible of .
In respectability of character , there can be no doubt that they are .
Indeed they are very delightful apples , and Mrs . Wallis does them full justice -- only we do not have them baked more than twice , and Mr . Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times -- but Miss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it .
You do us a great deal of honour to - day , I am sure .
Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer , and advised its being written directly , which was agreed to , in the hope of her assistance ; and though Emma continued to protest against any assistance being wanted , it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence .
" Dating from three o ' clock yesterday .
He had been most agreeable , most delightful ; he had told Harriet that he had seen them go by , and had purposely followed them ; other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt , but nothing serious .
I shall be at home in twenty minutes ."
The strength of the song falls on the second ."
" Upon my word ," she cried , " the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking .
" Me , my love ," cried his wife , hearing and understanding only in part .-- " Are you talking about me ?-- I am sure nobody ought to be , or can be , a greater advocate for matrimony than I am ; and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving Hartfield , I should never have thought of Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world ; and as to slighting Mr . Weston , that excellent Mr . Weston , I think there is nothing he does not deserve .
How will a conundrum reckon ?"
" Oh !"
" You cannot do better , sir ."
What an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream !
They must not do less than others , or she should be exposed to odious suspicions , and imagined capable of pitiful resentment .
Do not be impatient , Emma ; it will all come out too soon ."
Now Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte ; and the remembrance of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing , that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough ; and , with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to say of the good wishes which she really felt , took leave .
` Full many a flower is born to blush unseen , ` And waste its fragrance on the desert air .'
No !
It seems an impossibility !-- You cannot mean to say , that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin .
Many vain solicitudes would be prevented -- many awkwardnesses smoothed by it .
Weston ."
and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things ?"
" Oh !
He did speak yesterday -- that is , he wrote , and was refused ."
Miss Hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a Bristol -- merchant , of course , he must be called ; but , as the whole of the profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate , it was not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very moderate also .
But I am quite in the minority , I believe ; few people seem to value simplicity of dress ,-- show and finery are every thing .
This is like giving ourselves a slap , to be sure !
" Ah !
I have often known it done myself ."
Mrs . Weston ' s communications furnished Emma with more food for unpleasant reflection , by increasing her esteem and compassion , and her sense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax .
Two or three more of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them , and it was to be done in a quiet , unpretending , elegant way , infinitely superior to the bustle and preparation , the regular eating and drinking , and picnic parade of the Eltons and the Sucklings .
To give up one ' s child !
He was here only a quarter of an hour , and in a state of agitation which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay -- but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said .
You provide for the family , you know , ( with a smile at his father ).
Jane was quite longing to go to Ireland , from his account of things ."
Not more than five couple could be mustered ; but the rarity and the suddenness of it made it very delightful , and she found herself well matched in a partner .
So she thought at first ;-- but a little consideration convinced her that every thing need not be put off .
I almost long to attempt her likeness myself .
This will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about Emma , Mr .
He asked me if he could do any thing .
Shall we walk , Augusta ?"
It was a long , well - written letter , giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings , expressing all the affection , gratitude , and respect which was natural and honourable , and describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed attractive , with spirit and precision .
The good sense of Colonel and Mrs . Campbell could not oppose such a resolution , though their feelings did .
They would feel that they could trust him ; that the nephew who had done rightly by his father , would do rightly by them ; for they know , as well as he does , as well as all the world must know , that he ought to pay this visit to his father ; and while meanly exerting their power to delay it , are in their hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims .
A cold stormy rain set in , and nothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs , which the wind was despoiling , and the length of the day , which only made such cruel sights the longer visible .
He knows he is wrong , and has nothing rational to urge .-- Bad .-- He ought not to have formed the engagement .--` His father ' s disposition :'-- he is unjust , however , to his father .
He was immediately interested .
To know that he has not thrown himself away , is such a comfort !-- She does seem a charming young woman , just what he deserves .
The difference which Randalls , Randalls alone makes in your goings - on , is very great ."
You would not think it to look at him , but he is bilious -- Mr . Cole is very bilious .
A few minutes more , and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own house , to get sober and cool , and the other recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over .
CHAPTER I
Some time afterwards it was , " I think Mrs . Goddard would be very much surprized if she knew what had happened .
I am tired of doing nothing .
Every moment had brought a fresh surprize ; and every surprize must be matter of humiliation to her .-- How to understand it all !
Mr . Woodhouse would have been miserable had his daughter attempted it , and she was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas .
There was no want of likeness , she had been fortunate in the attitude , and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure , to give a little more height , and considerably more elegance , she had great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last , and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both -- a standing memorial of the beauty of one , the skill of the other , and the friendship of both ; with as many other agreeable associations as Mr . Elton ' s very promising attachment was likely to add .
He is desperately in love and means to marry her ."
.
However , I think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again .
" I wish you may not get into a scrape , Harriet , whenever he does marry ;-- I mean , as to being acquainted with his wife -- for though his sisters , from a superior education , are not to be altogether objected to , it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice .
.
Mr . Weston would not be blind to folly , though in his own son ; but he is very likely to have a more yielding , complying , mild disposition than would suit your notions of man ' s perfection .
I was the most miserable wretch !"
A reasonable visit paid , Mr . Weston began to move .--" He must be going .
Emma was extremely glad to see him -- but there was a degree of confusion -- a number of embarrassing recollections on each side .
She was as happy as possible with the Martins in the summer .
" Oh !
It is not every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did , and refuse to take Jane ' s answer ; but she positively declared she would _not_ write any such denial yesterday , as Jane wished her ; she would wait -- and , sure enough , yesterday evening it was all settled that Jane should go .
Or , perhaps she may not have resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life .
I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions , though you make so noble a profession of doing it , but I honestly tell you what they are ."
I suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere .
My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings , Lords of the earth !
I should not wonder if it were to bring on the declaration .
" Oh yes , papa .
Mr . Woodhouse agreed to it all , but added ,
We were speaking the other day , you know , of his being so warm an admirer of her performance ."
It struck her with dreadful force , and she was ready to give it every bad name in the world .
It is a great deal more natural than one could wish , that a young man , brought up by those who are proud , luxurious , and selfish , should be proud , luxurious , and selfish too .
No invitation came amiss to her .
Mr . Knightley ' s excessive curiosity to know what this word might be , made him seize every possible moment for darting his eye towards it , and it was not long before he saw it to be _Dixon_ .
He was afraid not even Miss Woodhouse "-- he stopt a moment --" or Miss Smith could inspire him ."
This was too true for contradiction .
She was feeling too much ; but at last Emma collected from her enough to understand the sort of meeting , and the sort of pain it was creating .
It was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece of news , as proving that Mr . Elton could not have suffered long ; but she was sorry for Harriet : Harriet must feel it -- and all that she could hope was , by giving the first information herself , to save her from hearing it abruptly from others .
This is meeting quite in fairy - land !-- Such a transformation !-- Must not compliment , I know ( eyeing Emma most complacently )-- that would be rude -- but upon my word , Miss Woodhouse , you do look -- how do you like Jane ' s hair ?-- You are a judge .-- She did it all herself .
Exactly so .
" Nay , she has always been a first favourite with him , as you very well know ."
