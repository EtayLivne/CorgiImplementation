Mr . Woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the utmost that his nerves could bear -- and here would be a ninth -- and Emma apprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even to Hartfield for forty - eight hours without falling in with a dinner - party .
Mr . Elton is good - humoured , cheerful , obliging , and gentle .
` If _Miss_ _Taylor_ undertakes to wrap Miss Emma up , you need not have any fears , sir .'
And a delightful dance it was to be .
I do look forward to it , I own , with _very_ great pleasure ."
" Something that would do !"
There is a littleness about him which you discovered , and which I did not : and I was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet .
The subject followed ; it was in plain , unaffected , gentlemanlike English , such as Mr . Knightley used even to the woman he was in love with , how to be able to ask her to marry him , without attacking the happiness of her father .
It is too unlikely , for me to believe it without proof ."
I admired your spirit ; and I dare say we shall get home very well .
She thought nothing of his attachment , and was insulted by his hopes .
asked Mrs .
The party did not break up without Emma ' s being positively secured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening , nor without her overhearing Mr . Weston whisper to his wife , " He has asked her , my dear .
Robert Martin would never have proceeded so far , if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him .
The gentlemen spoke of his horse .
" He had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed -- he had not stopped , he would not stop for more than a word -- but he had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call , and much as he wished to stay longer at Hartfield , he must hurry off ."
Two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the over - throw of every thing .
A cold stormy rain set in , and nothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs , which the wind was despoiling , and the length of the day , which only made such cruel sights the longer visible .
can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from Harriet to me ?-- Absurd and insufferable !"
There could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her .
CHAPTER XVII
The idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse , whom she really loved extremely , made her wretched for a while , and when the violence of grief was comforted away , still remained powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it very tolerably .
There would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb , or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities .-- No , I am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly ."
What !
" My picture !-- But he has left my picture in Bond - street ."
And so then , in my nonsense , I could not help making a treasure of it -- so I put it by never to be used , and looked at it now and then as a great treat ."
the best nature in the world -- a wedding ."
He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived more evil than good from them .
The prospect before her now , was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled -- that might not be even partially brightened .
The fever was over , and Emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by injurious courtesy .
She had taken up a wrong idea , fancying it was a mother and daughter , a son and son ' s wife , who all lived together ; but when it appeared that the Mr . Martin , who bore a part in the narrative , and was always mentioned with approbation for his great good - nature in doing something or other , was a single man ; that there was no young Mrs . Martin , no wife in the case ; she did suspect danger to her poor little friend from all this hospitality and kindness , and that , if she were not taken care of , she might be required to sink herself forever .
As it was , I was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit .
I think Harriet is doing extremely well .
I am going to London , to spend a few days with John and Isabella .
I knew it was -- but had not resolution enough to part with them ."
Mr . Elton was so hot and tired , that all this wit seemed thrown away .
True , true , you are acquainted with Miss Fairfax ; I remember you knew her at Weymouth , and a fine girl she is .
you forget yourself -- you take me for my friend -- any message to Miss Smith I shall be happy to deliver ; but no more of this to _me_ , if you please ."
Well , time does fly indeed !-- and my memory is very bad .
On the subject of the first of the two circumstances , she did , after a little reflection , venture the following question .
Tell me how Miss Fairfax is ."
Well , Frank , your dream certainly shews that Highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent .
The beginning , however , of every visit displayed none but the properest feelings , and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality .
We invalids think we are privileged people ."
I hope you find a chair .
He may be sure of every woman ' s approbation while he writes with such gallantry ."
I wanted to know a little more , and this tells me quite enough .
" Indeed , Harriet , it would have been a severe pang to lose you ; but it must have been .
" I must spend some time with them ; I am sure they will want it ;-- afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself .
"' Tis twelve ; I shall not forget to think of you four hours hence ; and by this time to - morrow , perhaps , or a little later , I may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here .
" Leave out the two last lines , and there is no reason why you should not write it into your book ."
I was snowed up at a friend ' s house once for a week .
It was Miss Taylor ' s loss which first brought grief .
He only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself ; and if Miss Woodhouse of Hartfield , the heiress of thirty thousand pounds , were not quite so easily obtained as he had fancied , he would soon try for Miss Somebody else with twenty , or with ten .
It was Miss Taylor ' s loss which first brought grief .
In the meanwhile , she resolved against seeing Harriet .-- It would do neither of them good , it would do the subject no good , to be talking of it farther .-- She was resolved not to be convinced , as long as she could doubt , and yet had no authority for opposing Harriet ' s confidence .
.
" I have not said , exert yourself Harriet for my sake ; think less , talk less of Mr . Elton for my sake ; because for your own sake rather , I would wish it to be done , for the sake of what is more important than my comfort , a habit of self - command in you , a consideration of what is your duty , an attention to propriety , an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others , to save your health and credit , and restore your tranquillity .
I thought -- but I beg your pardon , perhaps I have been under a mistake .
She had not time to know how Mr . Elton took the reproof , so rapidly did another subject succeed ; for Mr . John Knightley now came into the room from examining the weather , and opened on them all with the information of the ground being covered with snow , and of its still snowing fast , with a strong drifting wind ; concluding with these words to Mr . Woodhouse :
He had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted , and he could sometimes act an ungracious , or say a severe thing .
Though her nephew had had no particular reason to hasten back on her account , she had not lived above six - and - thirty hours after his return .
He had reached Randalls the evening before .
" For the present , the whole affair was to be completely a secret .
She opened the parlour door , and saw two gentlemen sitting with her father -- Mr . Weston and his son .
" He appears rough to you ," said Emma , " because you are so very gentle yourself ; but if you could compare him with other papas , you would not think him rough .
I need not tell you what is to be done .
Without scruple -- without apology -- without much apparent diffidence , Mr . Elton , the lover of Harriet , was professing himself _her_ lover .
" From something that he said , my dear Emma , I rather imagine --"
Emma watched and decided , that with such feelings as were now shewn , it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting himself ; that he had not been acting a part , or making a parade of insincere professions ; and that Mr . Knightley certainly had not done him justice .
She was out ; and I felt it impossible not to wait till she came in .
Frank was next to Emma , Jane opposite to them -- and Mr . Knightley so placed as to see them all ; and it was his object to see as much as he could , with as little apparent observation .
Being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling , I have been in no hurry with my congratulations ; but I hope it all went off tolerably well .
A very few days brought the party from London , and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with Harriet , than she became perfectly satisfied -- unaccountable as it was !-- that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr . Knightley , and was now forming all her views of happiness .
how peculiarly unprepared I was !-- for I had reason to believe her very lately more determined against him , much more , than she was before ."
She was a great talker upon little matters , which exactly suited Mr . Woodhouse , full of trivial communications and harmless gossip .
Oh no ; we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart , and were sure of meeting every day ."
And now , let me talk to you of something else .
With such sensations , Mr . Elton ' s civilities were dreadfully ill - timed ; but she had the comfort of appearing very polite , while feeling very cross -- and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again , or the substance of it , from the open - hearted Mr .
Proportions , fore - shortening .-- Oh no !
Knightley ."
How do you do ?-- Very well , I thank you .
for I think you have a little cold , and Patty has been washing the kitchen .'--` Oh !
And , besides , I must give you a hint , Frank ; any want of attention to her _here_ should be carefully avoided .
Mr . Knightley might quarrel with her , but Emma could not quarrel with herself .
" Oh !
Randalls is such a distance .
Her sister , though comparatively but little removed by matrimony , being settled in London , only sixteen miles off , was much beyond her daily reach ; and many a long October and November evening must be struggled through at Hartfield , before Christmas brought the next visit from Isabella and her husband , and their little children , to fill the house , and give her pleasant society again .
" Oh !
Emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important service which his better sense would have rendered her , to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly follies -- her wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith ; but it was too tender a subject .-- She could not enter on it .-- Harriet was very seldom mentioned between them .
This is saying very plainly --` Pray , Miss Smith , give me leave to pay my addresses to you .
leave all that to me .
It will not be so great a loss of time : but if you dislike it --"
The youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy , and of powerful operation ; and if the distress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed , they will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope .
Emma listened with the warmest concern ; grieved for her more and more , and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful .
I am sure , a month ago , I had no more idea myself !-- The strangest things do take place !"
And , by the bye , can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion ?-- Pray be sincere , Knightley .
It was a great consolation that Mr . Elton should not be really in love with her , or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint him -- that Harriet ' s nature should not be of that superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive -- and that there could be no necessity for any body ' s knowing what had passed except the three principals , and especially for her father ' s being given a moment ' s uneasiness about it .
Worse and worse .
I have no faith in Mrs . Elton ' s acknowledging herself the inferior in thought , word , or deed ; or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good - breeding .
