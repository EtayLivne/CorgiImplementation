I cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side ; but I am sure there is a great wish on the Churchills ' to keep him to themselves .
Emma ' s confusion , and the acknowledged intimacy , seemed to declare her affection engaged .
You must see the difference ."
What right had he to endeavour to please , as he certainly did -- to distinguish any one young woman with persevering attention , as he certainly did -- while he really belonged to another ?-- How could he tell what mischief he might be doing ?-- How could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him ?-- very wrong , very wrong indeed ."
How it would affect Frank was among the earliest thoughts of both .
This is the simple truth ."
It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his schemes ; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth , it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase Randalls , and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to ; but he had gone steadily on , with these objects in view , till they were accomplished .
.
" Take a little time , consider , do not commit yourself ."
He was so busy the last time he was at Kingston that he quite forgot it , but he goes again to - morrow .
I am sure he was particularly silent when Mrs . Cole told us of it at dinner ."
Whenever you are transplanted , like me , Miss Woodhouse , you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind .
Mrs . Weston was disappointed .
Emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable ; the conviction was strengthened by what followed .
It was also a very early speculation with Emma .
What a blessing it is , when undue influence does not survive the grave !-- He gave his consent with very little persuasion ."
Their road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane , a lane leading at right angles from the broad , though irregular , main street of the place ; and , as may be inferred , containing the blessed abode of Mr . Elton .
" You should have gone to Cromer , my dear , if you went anywhere .-- Perry was a week at Cromer once , and he holds it to be the best of all the sea - bathing places .
" How d ' ye do ?-- how d ' ye do ?-- We have been sitting with your father -- glad to see him so well .
I must think your statement by no means fair .
It was a delightful visit ;-- perfect , in being much too short .
" I have always admired her complexion ," replied Emma , archly ; " but do not I remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale ?-- When we first began to talk of her .-- Have you quite forgotten ?"
He might observe that it was so .
But , however , I found afterwards from Patty , that William said it was all the apples of _that_ sort his master had ; he had brought them all -- and now his master had not one left to bake or boil .
It was her superior duty .
She understood their ways , could allow for their ignorance and their temptations , had no romantic expectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had done so little ; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy , and always gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good - will .
Had you witnessed my behaviour there , I can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well of me again .
" Not quite ," returned Emma , with forced calmness , " for all that you then said , appeared to me to relate to a different person .
With mixed feelings , she seated herself at a little distance from the numbers round the instrument , to listen .
It was a sad event -- a great shock -- with all her faults , what would Mr . Churchill do without her ?
Dear me !
" He should be happy to see Mrs . Goddard .
for myself , I protest I must be excused ," said Mrs . Elton ; " _I_ really cannot attempt -- I am not at all fond of the sort of thing .
" Thank you , dear Miss Woodhouse , you are all kindness .-- It is impossible to say -- Yes , indeed , I quite understand -- dearest Jane ' s prospects -- that is , I do not mean .-- But she is charmingly recovered .-- How is Mr .
She plays charmingly ."
He had returned to a late dinner , after some days ' absence , and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were well in Brunswick Square .
He sends us a sack every year ; and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees -- I believe there is two of them .
" Be satisfied ," said he , " I will not raise any outcry .
Emma felt that she could not do too much for her , that Harriet had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience ; but it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing any effect , for ever agreed to , without being able to make their opinions the same .
" Have you indeed , sir ?-- Bless me !
" I do not find myself making any use of the word _sacrifice_ ," said she .-- " In not one of all my clever replies , my delicate negatives , is there any allusion to making a sacrifice .
Mr . Cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago ."
Mr . Woodhouse agreed to it all , but added ,
It was not lost on me .
Mrs . Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday , and asked all the three teachers , Miss Nash , and Miss Prince , and Miss Richardson , to sup with her ."
Would Jane but go , means were to be found , servants sent , friends contrived -- no travelling difficulty allowed to exist ; but still she had declined it !
I think it is the state of mind which gives most spirit and delight .
" Low , I am afraid , sir , very low ," answered his son ;--" but we shall be indulgent -- especially to any one who leads the way ."
I never heard any county but Surry called so ."
She had not time to know how Mr . Elton took the reproof , so rapidly did another subject succeed ; for Mr . John Knightley now came into the room from examining the weather , and opened on them all with the information of the ground being covered with snow , and of its still snowing fast , with a strong drifting wind ; concluding with these words to Mr . Woodhouse :
Your resolution , or rather your expectation of never marrying , results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer , would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you .
This has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed .
Elton .-- She looked round for a moment ; he had joined Mr . Knightley at a little distance , and was arranging himself for settled conversation , while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife .
Let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations .
Oh !
Frank comes to - morrow -- I had a letter this morning -- we see him to - morrow by dinner - time to a certainty -- he is at Oxford to - day , and he comes for a whole fortnight ; I knew it would be so .
" My mother ' s deafness is very trifling you see -- just nothing at all .
" Your parish there was small ," said Jane .
My courage rises while I write .
" Ah !
His spirits required support .
He walked off to find his father , but was quickly back again with both Mr . and Mrs . Weston .
That Mr . and Mrs . Weston did think of it , she was very strongly persuaded ; and though not meaning to be induced by him , or by any body else , to give up a situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could change it for , she had a great curiosity to see him , a decided intention of finding him pleasant , of being liked by him to a certain degree , and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends ' imaginations .
The circumstance was told him at Hartfield ; for the moment , he was silent ; but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself , over a newspaper he held in his hand , " Hum !
You will be adored in Highbury .
To her he looked for comfort ; and her assurances of safety , her representation of the excellence of the horses , and of James , and of their having so many friends about them , revived him a little .
Conceive what the events of a week have done in that family !
I rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness than I deserve .
You know , Mrs . Weston , you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves .
Mrs . Elton is very good - natured and agreeable , and I dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought to be .
He had done his duty and could return to his son .
This is all that I can relate of the how , where , and when .
He had made his fortune , bought his house , and obtained his wife ; and was beginning a new period of existence , with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through .
Elton may talk sentimentally , but he will act rationally .
Often as she had wished for and ordered it , she had never been able to get any thing tolerable .
One perplexity , however , arose , which the gentlemen did not disdain .
Such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs . Weston .
They sat down to tea -- the same party round the same table -- how often it had been collected !-- and how often had her eyes fallen on the same shrubs in the lawn , and observed the same beautiful effect of the western sun !-- But never in such a state of spirits , never in any thing like it ; and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house , or even the attentive daughter .
But no sooner was the distress known to Mr . Elton , than it was removed .
Miss Woodhouse , do you think we shall ever find it out ?"
It would hold the very number for comfort .
said Emma , as she turned back into the hall again .
Emma was delighted , and only wanted him to go on in the same style ; but his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own Jane , and his next words were ,
The evil day was put off .
" Yes , Frank came over this morning , just to ask us how we did ."
" Ah !
I assure you I have .
Dinner - parties and evening - parties were made for him and his lady ; and invitations flowed in so fast that she had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were never to have a disengaged day .
there I am -- thinking of him directly .
Oh no !
She could never see a fault in any of them .
Time , however , she thought , would tell him that they ought to be friends again .
" Upon my word !
" You are extremely kind ," replied Miss Bates , highly gratified ; " you who are such a judge , and write so beautifully yourself .
They had gone , in short -- and very great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady .
He should like to see the old house again exceedingly , and should be very happy to meet Mr . and Mrs . Elton , and any other of his neighbours .-- He could not see any objection at all to his , and Emma ' s , and Harriet ' s going there some very fine morning .
She introduced him to her friend , Miss Smith , and , at convenient moments afterwards , heard what each thought of the other .
Voices approached the shop -- or rather one voice and two ladies : Mrs . Weston and Miss Bates met them at the door .
and it will not be very long , I hope , before that becomes the acknowledgment of more than your reason .-- Fortunate that your affections were not farther entangled !-- I could never , I confess , from your manners , assure myself as to the degree of what you felt -- I could only be certain that there was a preference -- and a preference which I never believed him to deserve .-- He is a disgrace to the name of man .-- And is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman ?-- Jane , Jane , you will be a miserable creature ."
" Nonsense !
