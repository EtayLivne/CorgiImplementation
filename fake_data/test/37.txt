Would not Mr . Knightley shew them the gardens -- all the gardens ?-- She wished to see the whole extent ."
It was better to pay my visit , then "--
We hear of him for ever at some watering - place or other .
" My dearest papa !
You must see the difference ."
Nobody is healthy in London , nobody can be .
I honestly said as much to Mr . E . when he was speaking of my future home , and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable ; and the inferiority of the house too -- knowing what I had been accustomed to -- of course he was not wholly without apprehension .
You should not have done it , indeed you should not .
" It is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion ," said Mr . Knightley .
Harriet , who had been standing in no unhappy reverie , was yet very glad to be called from it , by the now encouraging manner of such a judge , and such a friend as Miss Woodhouse , and only wanted invitation , to give the history of her hopes with great , though trembling delight .-- Emma ' s tremblings as she asked , and as she listened , were better concealed than Harriet ' s , but they were not less .
She had many acquaintance in the place , for her father was universally civil , but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for even half a day .
Much better employed talking to the young ladies .
" Oh !
" I am afraid we must be running away ," said Emma , glancing at Harriet , and beginning to rise --" My father will be expecting us .
He liked very much to have his friends come and see him ; and from various united causes , from his long residence at Hartfield , and his good nature , from his fortune , his house , and his daughter , he could command the visits of his own little circle , in a great measure , as he liked .
" Ah !
I had a letter from him this morning , and he will be with us within a fortnight ."
" Miss Smith !-- message to Miss Smith !-- What could she possibly mean !"
There is an anxiety , a curiosity in what one feels for Emma .
I am a talker , you know ; I am rather a talker ; and now and then I have let a thing escape me which I should not .
As to the pretence of trying her native air , I look upon that as a mere excuse .-- In the summer it might have passed ; but what can any body ' s native air do for them in the months of January , February , and March ?
" That is a grand pianoforte , and he might think it too large for Mrs . Bates ' s house ."
What is it ?-- why do you smile so ?-- where did you hear it ?-- at Randalls ?"
It would be almost beginning their life of civility again .
You do not think I could mean _you_ , or suppose Mr . Knightley to mean _you_ .
" What two letters !-- express perfection !
no , indeed ."
" Indeed , the truth was , that poor dear Jane could not bear to see any body -- any body at all -- Mrs . Elton , indeed , could not be denied -- and Mrs . Cole had made such a point -- and Mrs . Perry had said so much -- but , except them , Jane would really see nobody ."
I should not wonder if it were to bring on the declaration .
I shall certainly be at leisure ."
Who makes you their confidant ?"
" And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking ?"
" I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father -- or even may be some encumbrance to you , if your visiting engagements continue to increase as much as they have done lately ."
A mind like hers , once opening to suspicion , made rapid progress .
" We had better move on , Mr . Weston ," said she , " we are detaining the girls ."
She had a little beauty and a little accomplishment , but so little judgment that she thought herself coming with superior knowledge of the world , to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood ; and conceived Miss Hawkins to have held such a place in society as Mrs . Elton ' s consequence only could surpass .
Emma was gratified , to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character , and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance .
Emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost ; and all that was amiable , all that ought to be attaching , seemed on Harriet ' s side , not her own .
No indeed I am not ."
I met her frequently at Weymouth .
For Miss ----------, read Miss Smith .
Emma wondered on what , of all the medley , she would fix .
" Poor creatures !
I can hardly imagine the young man whom I saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well , if left quite to his own powers , and yet it is not the style of a woman ; no , certainly , it is too strong and concise ; not diffuse enough for a woman .
She had understood it was to be delayed till Colonel Campbell ' s return ."
It is always the lady ' s right to decide on the degree of acquaintance .
He sat by her at dinner .
Now , it would be really having Frank in their neighbourhood .
" But you need not imagine Mr . Weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up Henry or John .
He wanted to marry well , and having the arrogance to raise his eyes to her , pretended to be in love ; but she was perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for .
The answer was only in this short note :
Such another scheme , composed of so many ill - assorted people , she hoped never to be betrayed into again .
very delightful indeed ; I can say nothing less , for I suppose Miss Woodhouse and Mr . Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that passes .
she was not so easily to be talked out of it .
Frank Churchill returned to his station by Emma ; and as soon as Miss Bates was quiet , she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse of Mrs . Elton and Miss Fairfax , who were standing a little way behind her .-- He was thoughtful .
" These matters are always a secret , till it is found out that every body knows them .
At this moment , an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma ' s brain with regard to Jane Fairfax , this charming Mr . Dixon , and the not going to Ireland , she said , with the insidious design of farther discovery ,
Mr . Knightley had done all in his power for Mr . Woodhouse ' s entertainment .
CHAPTER VII
What a horrible idea !
" Well ," said Mrs . Weston , smiling , " you give him credit for more simple , disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do ; for while Miss Bates was speaking , a suspicion darted into my head , and I have never been able to get it out again .
For half an hour Mr . Weston was surprized and sorry ; but then he began to perceive that Frank ' s coming two or three months later would be a much better plan ; better time of year ; better weather ; and that he would be able , without any doubt , to stay considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner .
She could not speak another word .-- Her voice was lost ; and she sat down , waiting in great terror till Harriet should answer .
God knows , I have been a very indifferent lover .-- But you understand me .-- Yes , you see , you understand my feelings -- and will return them if you can .
That is what she writes about .
" And mine ," said Mr . Knightley warmly , " is , that if he turn out any thing like it , he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing !
It was a happy circumstance , and animated Mr . Woodhouse for some time .
This is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating .
I assure you , Jane Fairfax is a very delightful character , and interests me more than I can express ."
_What_ she was , must be uncertain ; but _who_ she was , might be found out ; and setting aside the 10 , 000 l ., it did not appear that she was at all Harriet ' s superior .
Mr . Elton is good - humoured , cheerful , obliging , and gentle .
Emma was gratified , to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character , and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance .
She had no scruple with regard to him .
how shall you employ yourself when you grow old ?"
Emma continued ,
Were not you struck ?
I used to be quite angry with Selina ; but really I begin now to comprehend that a married woman has many things to call her attention .
He was no dancer in general .
-- You always called me , ` Mr . Knightley ;' and , from habit , it has not so very formal a sound .-- And yet it is formal .
Mrs . Weston was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made himself -- how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether .
I have no pleasure in seeing my friends , unless I can believe myself fit to be seen ."
if you were to see what a headache she has .
It was kindly said , and very far from giving offence .
I am quite ready .
Small heart had Harriet for visiting .
In this style she ran on ; never thoroughly stopped by any thing till Mr . Woodhouse came into the room ; her vanity had then a change of object , and Emma heard her saying in the same half - whisper to Jane ,
A Miss Hawkins of Bath .
you are an odd creature !"
He knew her illnesses ; they never occurred but for her own convenience .
Nothing should separate her from her father .
he told me all about it ; that Jane Fairfax and Mr . Frank Churchill are to be married , and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while .
Often as she had wished for and ordered it , she had never been able to get any thing tolerable .
Accordingly , with a mixture of the serious and the playful , which she hoped would best suit his half and half state , she replied ,
no -- a very bad plan .
I know what you mean -- but Emma ' s hand is the strongest ."
" My dear , you are too particular ," said her husband .
Harriet could just answer , " Oh !
but indeed I would much rather have it only in one .
Harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager exclamation .
I knew the name , the place , I knew all about it , and instantly saw what she had been doing .
