I think their father is too rough with them very often ."
I knew the name , the place , I knew all about it , and instantly saw what she had been doing .
" I do not often walk this way _now_ ," said Emma , as they proceeded , " but _then_ there will be an inducement , and I shall gradually get intimately acquainted with all the hedges , gates , pools and pollards of this part of Highbury ."
He caught her ."
Is not it a good exchange ?-- You consent -- I hope you consent ?"
John Knightley only was in mute astonishment .-- That a man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a day of business in London , should set off again , and walk half a mile to another man ' s house , for the sake of being in mixed company till bed - time , of finishing his day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers , was a circumstance to strike him deeply .
Not that I think Mr . Martin would ever marry any body but what had had some education -- and been very well brought up .
" Oh !
Emma was most sincerely interested .
I wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings .
Mr . Elton knows you ."
One would fancy we were bosom friends !
When the visit was returned , Emma made up her mind .
The acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her .
" Oh !
She felt that , in quitting Donwell , he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits ; that in living constantly with her father , and in no house of his own , there would be much , very much , to be borne with .
Miss Woodhouse , what a pity that I must not write this beautiful charade into my book !
Her influence would have been enough .
" I met William Larkins ," continued Mr . Elton , " as I got near the house , and he told me I should not find his master at home , but I did not believe him .-- William seemed rather out of humour .
" That may be -- but not by sketches in Swisserland .
This was the occurrence :-- The Coles had been settled some years in Highbury , and were very good sort of people -- friendly , liberal , and unpretending ; but , on the other hand , they were of low origin , in trade , and only moderately genteel .
" He should be happy to see Mrs . Goddard .
" But you are always kind ."
Harriet turned away ; but Emma could receive him with the usual smile , and her quick eye soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a push -- of having thrown a die ; and she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up .
No , indeed , Miss Woodhouse , you need not be afraid ; I can sit and admire him now without any great misery .
-- and as clearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth .
with a deep sigh , that he wished I might find as much happiness in the marriage state as he had done .-- I felt that it would be of a different sort .-- Are you disposed to pity me for what I must have suffered in opening the cause to him , for my suspense while all was at stake ?-- No ; do not pity me till I reached Highbury , and saw how ill I had made her .
But you know what I am .-- You hear nothing but truth from me .-- I have blamed you , and lectured you , and you have borne it as no other woman in England would have borne it .-- Bear with the truths I would tell you now , dearest Emma , as well as you have borne with them .
" My Emma !"
The evening was quiet and conversable , as Mr . Woodhouse declined cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear Isabella , and the little party made two natural divisions ; on one side he and his daughter ; on the other the two Mr . Knightleys ; their subjects totally distinct , or very rarely mixing -- and Emma only occasionally joining in one or the other .
Did you ever hear any thing so strange ?
Mr . Woodhouse very soon followed them into the drawing - room .
Did you ever hear any thing so strange ?
Would not Mr . Knightley shew them the gardens -- all the gardens ?-- She wished to see the whole extent ."
What a thinking brain you have !
I should like to see two more here ,-- your pretty little friend , Miss Smith , and my son -- and then I should say we were quite complete .
Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived the former good old days of the room ?-- She who could do any thing in Highbury !
Just as your drawings always are , my dear .
he cried .
The most satisfactory comparisons were rising in her mind .
Dining once with the Coles -- and having a ball talked of , which never took place .
A situation such as you deserve , and your friends would require for you , is no everyday occurrence , is not obtained at a moment ' s notice ; indeed , indeed , we must begin inquiring directly ."
Jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour , and they had only accomplished some views of St . Mark ' s Place , Venice , when Frank Churchill entered the room .
-- Harriet ' s was --
very true indeed .
Oh !
Pray excuse me ; but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy , it cannot be expected that Emma , accountable to nobody but her father , who perfectly approves the acquaintance , should put an end to it , so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself .
" Nonsense !
This , you know , speaks a great degree of weakness -- but now she is so impatient to be in town , that she means to sleep only two nights on the road .-- So Frank writes word .
The character of Mrs . Churchill , the grief of her husband -- her mind glanced over them both with awe and compassion -- and then rested with lightened feelings on how Frank might be affected by the event , how benefited , how freed .
He is an excellent young man , and will suit Harriet exactly ; it will be an ` Exactly so ,' as he says himself ; but he does sigh and languish , and study for compliments rather more than I could endure as a principal .
He said , from the first , it was a very good sort -- which was our great comfort ; but the measles are a dreadful complaint .
" I hope so -- for at that time I was a fool ."
Miss Bates looked about her , so happily !--
Jane looked as if she did not mean to be conquered ; but instead of answering , she began speaking again to Mr . John Knightley .
One set might recommend their all removing to Donwell , and leaving Hartfield for the John Knightleys ; and another might predict disagreements among their servants ; but yet , upon the whole , there was no serious objection raised , except in one habitation , the Vicarage .-- There , the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction .
" Very true .-- Well , a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again , late at night , and cold as the nights are now .
Why was the evil so dreadfully increased by Harriet ' s having some hope of a return ?
_There_ , indeed , lay real pleasure , for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty - four to his comfort ; and feeling that , unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and confiding esteem , she could not , in her general conduct , be open to any severe reproach .
Elton !"
" It is very unfair to judge of any body ' s conduct , without an intimate knowledge of their situation .
She could not think that Harriet ' s solace or her own sins required more ; and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned ;-- but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded , and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter , and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive -- " Mr . Elton is so good to the poor !"
His professions and his proposals did him no service .
" You speak too plain .
Mr . Perry is not gone ."
Nobody cares for a letter ; the thing is , to be always happy with pleasant companions .
."
You must remember it now ?"
Mr . Knightley and Harriet !-- It was an odd tete - a - tete ; but she was glad to see it .-- There had been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion , and turned from her with little ceremony .
Pray , pray attempt it .
Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech , and saw no alarming symptoms of love .
You cannot mean that he has even proposed to her again -- yet .
Mrs . Perry was always particularly fond of my mother -- indeed I do not know who is not -- and she had mentioned it to her in confidence ; she had no objection to her telling us , of course , but it was not to go beyond : and , from that day to this , I never mentioned it to a soul that I know of .
Harriet had business at Ford ' s .-- Emma thought it most prudent to go with her .
I am always glad to see him .
You will find , whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints , that it did not take her wholly by surprize .
As to myself , I am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings -- Nothing could be farther from my wishes -- your attachment to my friend Harriet -- your pursuit of her , ( pursuit , it appeared ,) gave me great pleasure , and I have been very earnestly wishing you success : but had I supposed that she were not your attraction to Hartfield , I should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent .
It did her no service however .
Woodhouse ?-- I am so glad to hear such a good account .
Emma saw its artifice , and returned to her first surmises .
Read it in comfort to yourself .
And as for Mrs . Hodges , Wright holds her very cheap indeed .-- She promised Wright a receipt , and never sent it ."
We admired it so much , that I have ventured to write it into Miss Smith ' s collection .
You will find , whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints , that it did not take her wholly by surprize .
June will soon be here ."
The man must be a blockhead who wanted more .
You begged hard to be commanded to come ."
She tried to stop him ; but vainly ; he would go on , and say it all .
What is the foolish girl about ?"
said he , turning his eyes towards Jane .
She ran away to indulge the inclination , leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to Harriet ' s share .
At this moment Frank began talking so vigorously , that Emma could not but imagine he had overheard his own praises , and did not want to hear more ;-- and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while , till another suspension brought Mrs . Elton ' s tones again distinctly forward .-- Mr .
Emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey ; and walking a few yards forward , while they talked together , soon made her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with Mr . Robert Martin .
Knightley !-- Mr .
Such was his own account at Randall ' s .
Its character as a ball - room caught him ; and instead of passing on , he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed windows which were open , to look in and contemplate its capabilities , and lament that its original purpose should have ceased .
One of those points on which his influence failed , he then mentioned .
I shall sit by you .
" If you please , my dear .
Only let me be told when I may speak out .-- I wonder whether Jane has any suspicion ."
