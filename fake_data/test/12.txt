You had , somehow or other , broken bounds yesterday , and run away from your own management ; but to - day you are got back again -- and as I cannot be always with you , it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine ."
This discovery laid many smaller matters open .
I promised my wife to leave it all to her .
" He has been wanting to come to us ," continued Mr . Weston , " ever since September : every letter has been full of it ; but he cannot command his own time .
She spoke with great agitation ; and Emma very feelingly replied , " That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now .
" As to the circumstances of her birth , though in a legal sense she may be called Nobody , it will not hold in common sense .
` Miss Woodhouse calls me the child of good fortune .'
Mr . and Mrs . Elton appeared ; and all the smiles and the proprieties passed .
" My dearest papa !
" I either depend more upon Emma ' s good sense than you do , or am more anxious for her present comfort ; for I cannot lament the acquaintance .
Miss Smith , the step at the turning ."
She was pleased , on taking leave , to find Miss Fairfax determined to attend her out of the room , to go with her even downstairs ; it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of , to say ,
Oh !
It is only by seeing women in their own homes , among their own set , just as they always are , that you can form any just judgment .
The style of the letter was much above her expectation .
There will not be time for any thing ."
The Picture , elegantly framed , came safely to hand soon after Mr . Elton ' s return , and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common sitting - room , he got up to look at it , and sighed out his half sentences of admiration just as he ought ; and as for Harriet ' s feelings , they were visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment as her youth and sort of mind admitted .
They will be extremely glad to see you , I am sure ; and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way ."
It would amuse away the difficulties of her part , and lessen the irksomeness of Miss Smith ' s ."
I am quite enough in love .
" And do you see her , sir , tolerably often ?"
And then fly off , through half a sentence , to her mother ' s old petticoat .
She was evidently displeased ; looked up , and seeing herself watched , blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her , and saying only , " I did not know that proper names were allowed ," pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit , and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered .
" Leave out the two last lines , and there is no reason why you should not write it into your book ."
We shall enjoy him completely ; every thing has turned out exactly as we could wish ."
Will you chuse a wife for me ?-- I am sure I should like any body fixed on by you .
-- And he repeated her words with such assurance of accent , such boastful pretence of amazement , that she could not help replying with quickness ,
It is not every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did , and refuse to take Jane ' s answer ; but she positively declared she would _not_ write any such denial yesterday , as Jane wished her ; she would wait -- and , sure enough , yesterday evening it was all settled that Jane should go .
Former provocations reappeared .
You must go to bed early , my dear -- and I recommend a little gruel to you before you go .-- You and I will have a nice basin of gruel together .
" If you are very kind ," said he , " it will be one of the waltzes we danced last night ;-- let me live them over again .
There was not a dissentient voice on the subject , either when Mrs . Perry drank tea with Mrs . and Miss Bates , or when Mrs . and Miss Bates returned the visit .
But still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully Mr . Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse danced -- for doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with Jane Fairfax -- and even for simple dancing itself , without any of the wicked aids of vanity -- to assist him first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made to hold -- and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour , in the hope of discovering , in spite of all that Mr . Weston could say of their exactly equal size , that it was a little the largest .
If it were to be shared with the woman he loved , he could not think any man to be pitied for having that house .
I think , on the contrary , when people shut themselves up entirely from society , it is a very bad thing ; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree , without living in it either too much or too little .
Miss Woodhouse , I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball .
said Mr . Weston , looking about .
I think your manners to him encouraging .
You are trying not to smile ."
I like them all ."
One good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal ,-- the ball at the Crown .
` Well ,' said she , ` it must be borne some time or other , and it may as well be now .'
" I hope he does ," replied Mr . Knightley coolly , and resuming the letter .
She heard Miss Bates ' s voice , something was to be done in a hurry ; the maid looked frightened and awkward ; hoped she would be pleased to wait a moment , and then ushered her in too soon .
Behold him there , the monarch of the seas !
You and Miss Fairfax gave us some very good music .
" Oh !
Oh !
A Mrs . Knightley for them all to give way to !-- No -- Mr .
Emma looked at her , quite unable to speak .
You are always with me ."
could not have supposed any thing !-- Such elegance and profusion !-- I have seen nothing like it since -- Well , where shall we sit ?
I say , Jane , what a perfect character you and I should make , if we could be shaken together .
Will you chuse a wife for me ?-- I am sure I should like any body fixed on by you .
" Why , to own the truth , I am afraid you are rather thrown away , and that with every disposition to bear , there will be nothing to be borne .
" Aye , I see what you are thinking of , the pianoforte .
A week to - morrow !-- And I have hardly begun to enjoy myself .
They are jealous even of his regard for his father .
A poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities , or neither .
He had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to Highbury , as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal ; and the greater part of her new acquaintance , disposed to commend , or not in the habit of judging , following the lead of Miss Bates ' s good - will , or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed herself , were very well satisfied ; so that Mrs . Elton ' s praise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do , unimpeded by Miss Woodhouse , who readily continued her first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being " very pleasant and very elegantly dressed ."
I took him as he was sleeping on the sofa , and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see .
" Well !
" And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain .
CHAPTER X
" To be sure .
Why does not Perry see her ?"
Mr . Weston was musing .
She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate , indulgent father ; and had , in consequence of her sister ' s marriage , been mistress of his house from a very early period .
Mrs . Weston , with her baby on her knee , indulging in such reflections as these , was one of the happiest women in the world .
Perry ."
He was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern .
The event was more favourable to Mr . Woodhouse than to Emma .
Either because he did not dance himself , or because the plan had been formed without his being consulted , he seemed resolved that it should not interest him , determined against its exciting any present curiosity , or affording him any future amusement .
You must have done well .
" Just as it should be ," said Mr . John Knightley , " and just as I hoped it was from your letters .
I saw the word , and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one , and so very distressing to the other ."
Yes , Harriet , just so long have I been wanting the very circumstance to happen what has happened .
There would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb , or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities .-- No , I am perfectly sure that he is not trifling or silly ."
As soon as she came to her own name , it was irresistible ; every line relating to herself was interesting , and almost every line agreeable ; and when this charm ceased , the subject could still maintain itself , by the natural return of her former regard for the writer , and the very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at that moment .
After some attempts , therefore , to be permitted to begin again , they were obliged to thank Mrs . Weston , look sorrowful , and have done .
such an aunt !"
" On this point we have been wretched .
Harriet was to sit again the next day ; and Mr . Elton , just as he ought , entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again .
" Oh !
He was on the move immediately ; but coming back , said ,
I cannot help suspecting him .
said she , " I get quite anxious about you .
By only raising my voice , and saying any thing two or three times over , she is sure to hear ; but then she is used to my voice .
The clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall .
There will be the leg to be salted , you know , which is so very nice , and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like ."
Jane says that Colonel Campbell is a little deaf .
The good was all to myself , by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me .
You are not just to Harriet ' s claims .
He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived more evil than good from them .
To those who had no resources it was a different thing ; but my resources made me quite independent .
Five couple are nothing , when one thinks seriously about it .
" Well , if you give me such kind encouragement , Mr . Elton , I believe I shall try what I can do .
Elton ?"
I should not mind walking half the way .
Soon after this Miss Bates came in , and Emma could not help being diverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself , resulting , she supposed , from doubt of what might be said , and impatience to say every thing .
