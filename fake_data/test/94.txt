" Exactly so ; that is what principally strikes me .
Oh !
she cried , looking aghast .
" Who shall answer that question ?"
Dancing with open windows !-- I am sure , neither your father nor Mrs . Weston ( poor Miss Taylor that was ) would suffer it ."
It saves trouble , and is a something to get me out .
And so does poor Mrs . Weston "-- with half a sigh and half a smile at her .
Skilful has been the hand !"
She went -- she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door , but had not been into the house since the morning after Box Hill , when poor Jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion , though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected .-- The fear of being still unwelcome , determined her , though assured of their being at home , to wait in the passage , and send up her name .-- She heard Patty announcing it ; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had before made so happily intelligible .-- No ; she heard nothing but the instant reply of , " Beg her to walk up ;"-- and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself , coming eagerly forward , as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient .-- Emma had never seen her look so well , so lovely , so engaging .
And he smiled with such seeming pleasure at the conviction , that she must proceed another step .
Where shall we see a better daughter , or a kinder sister , or a truer friend ?
It was not with Mrs . Suckling , it was not with Mrs . Bragge , but in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them : it was with a cousin of Mrs . Bragge , an acquaintance of Mrs . Suckling , a lady known at Maple Grove .
So obliged to you for the carriage last night .
She heard him sigh .
I have not forgotten it , I assure you .-- Deceived myself , I did very miserably deceive you -- and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever .
We were speaking of it only yesterday , and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma , that there should be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with .
" Upon my word , Emma , to hear you abusing the reason you have , is almost enough to make me think so too .
" Then it would not be so strong a sense .
I like him very well ."
" It is one thing ," said she , presently -- her cheeks in a glow --" to have very good sense in a common way , like every body else , and if there is any thing to say , to sit down and write a letter , and say just what you must , in a short way ; and another , to write verses and charades like this ."
" Come Miss Woodhouse , Miss Otway , Miss Fairfax , what are you all doing ?-- Come Emma , set your companions the example .
She was short , plump , and fair , with a fine bloom , blue eyes , light hair , regular features , and a look of great sweetness , and , before the end of the evening , Emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person , and quite determined to continue the acquaintance .
" On your side , my love , it was very innocently done .
" And there will be the two Gilberts , young Cox , my father , and myself , besides Mr . Knightley .
She knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than she could perform with credit ; she wanted neither taste nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable , and could accompany her own voice well .
Every thing tender and charming was to mark their parting ; but still they were to part .
In her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her .
Knightley !-- Mr .
Ah !
" And now we shall just miss them ; too provoking !-- I do not know when I have been so disappointed ."
Harriet , here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good thoughts .
" Proof indeed !"
Whenever I see her , she always curtseys and asks me how I do , in a very pretty manner ; and when you have had her here to do needlework , I observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it .
" I have not said , exert yourself Harriet for my sake ; think less , talk less of Mr . Elton for my sake ; because for your own sake rather , I would wish it to be done , for the sake of what is more important than my comfort , a habit of self - command in you , a consideration of what is your duty , an attention to propriety , an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others , to save your health and credit , and restore your tranquillity .
Upon these occasions , a lady ' s character generally precedes her ; and Highbury has long known that you are a superior performer ."
She could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment to _her_ .
She was pondering , in the meanwhile , upon the possibility , without seeming very rude , of making her escape from Jane Fairfax ' s letter , and had almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse , when Miss Bates turned to her again and seized her attention .
Frank Churchill , of whom , in the eagerness of her conversation with Mrs . Weston , she had been seeing nothing , except that he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax , followed Mr . Cole , to add his very pressing entreaties ; and as , in every respect , it suited Emma best to lead , she gave a very proper compliance .
" Cautious , very cautious ," thought Emma ; " he advances inch by inch , and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure ."
But they live very comfortably .
Her introductions and recommendations must all wait , and every projected party be still only talked of .
Mrs . Weston , did you ever hear the like ?
They were both so truly respectable in their happiness , so disinterested in every sensation ; thought so much of Jane ; so much of every body , and so little of themselves , that every kindly feeling was at work for them .
I know , indeed , that he is so , and , as such , wish him well .
Harriet , Mr . Elton , and Mr . Knightley , their own especial set , were the only persons invited to meet them ;-- the hours were to be early , as well as the numbers few ; Mr . Woodhouse ' s habits and inclination being consulted in every thing .
In one moment such a change !
" I assure you she did .
" You would not have encouraged me , then , if you had understood me ?
The chances are that she must be a gainer ."
Now , Mr . Knightley , a word or two more , and I have done .
At her age she can have no experience , and with her little wit , is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her .
It must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed ; and she hoped , that when able to see them together again , she might at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were .-- She should see them henceforward with the closest observance ; and wretchedly as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching , she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here .-- He was expected back every day .
Oh !
She will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you , Miss Woodhouse , but your kindness will excuse her .
But the question is not , whether it would be a bad connexion for him , but whether he wishes it ; and I think he does .
Serle understands boiling an egg better than any body .
" You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax , sir , are you ?"
" Yes , Frank came over this morning , just to ask us how we did ."
" Yes ," said his brother quickly , " it is Randalls that does it all ."
He might have doubled his presumption to me -- but poor Harriet !"
I could not have believed it !
A superior performer !-- very far from it , I assure you .
We must go in the carriage , to be sure ."
" You are a very warm friend to Mr . Martin ; but , as I said before , are unjust to Harriet .
Still , however , though every thing had not been accomplished by her ingenious device , she could not but flatter herself that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both , and must be leading them forward to the great event .
And now , let me talk to you of something else .
" Yes ," said Emma , " I hope I do ."
" I think they will neither of them do the other any good ."
" I do not often walk this way _now_ ," said Emma , as they proceeded , " but _then_ there will be an inducement , and I shall gradually get intimately acquainted with all the hedges , gates , pools and pollards of this part of Highbury ."
Consider what you are about .
Oh !
" This sensation of listlessness , weariness , stupidity , this disinclination to sit down and employ myself , this feeling of every thing ' s being dull and insipid about the house !-- I must be in love ; I should be the oddest creature in the world if I were not -- for a few weeks at least .
In that respect Mrs . Weston ' s loss had been important .
" Ah !
She is reserved , more reserved , I think , than she used to be -- And I love an open temper .
And it is no small credit , in my opinion , to him , that he should excite such an affection ; for , though I would not say it to any body else , she has no more heart than a stone to people in general ; and the devil of a temper ."
Oh !
I wish Hetty had not gone .
We were always glad to see him at Hartfield ."
And ( raising his voice still more ) I do not see why Miss Fairfax should not be mentioned too .
The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards Harriet , from her mind , while he not only sat at her elbow , but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice , and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion .
said Mr . Woodhouse , always the last to make his way in conversation ; " then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady .
Your friend Harriet will make a much longer history when you see her .-- She will give you all the minute particulars , which only woman ' s language can make interesting .-- In our communications we deal only in the great .-- However , I must say , that Robert Martin ' s heart seemed for _him_ , and to _me_ , very overflowing ; and that he did mention , without its being much to the purpose , that on quitting their box at Astley ' s , my brother took charge of Mrs . John Knightley and little John , and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry ; and that at one time they were in such a crowd , as to make Miss Smith rather uneasy ."
she cried , satisfied to have no one preferred to herself .--" You are a humourist , and may say what you like .
Emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech , from his wife .
Harriet ' s sweet easy temper will not mind it ."
She felt that half this folly must be drunkenness , and therefore could hope that it might belong only to the passing hour .
If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment , I have nothing to say against it , but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me .-- Oh !
And then whispering -- " Our companions are excessively stupid .
It is a great deal more natural than one could wish , that a young man , brought up by those who are proud , luxurious , and selfish , should be proud , luxurious , and selfish too .
She says I fidget her to death ; and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she could almost say the same .
These are the motives which I have been pressing on you .
Jane desired me to do it , so I always do : and so I began to - day with my usual caution ; but no sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell , than I burst out , quite frightened , with ` Bless me !
" Well , Emma , I do not believe I have any thing more to say about the boys ; but you have your sister ' s letter , and every thing is down at full length there we may be sure .
" You think her diffident .
We really are so shocked !
" Very much to the honour of both ," was the handsome reply .
What !-- engaged to her all the winter -- before either of them came to Highbury ?"
" Then pray stay at Richmond ."
" That I am sure you would .
