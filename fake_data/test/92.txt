But I have done with expecting any course of steady reading from Emma .
You and Mr . Elton are one as clever as the other .
I shall not be far off , if you want me ."
Jane Fairfax did look and move superior ; but Emma suspected she might have been glad to change feelings with Harriet , very glad to have purchased the mortification of having loved -- yes , of having loved even Mr . Elton in vain -- by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend .
" I think , indeed ," said John Knightley pleasantly , " that Mr . Weston has some little claim .
A very few minutes more , however , completed the present trial .
Emma knew what was coming ; they must have the letter over again , and settle how long he had been gone , and how much he was engaged in company , and what a favourite he was wherever he went , and how full the Master of the Ceremonies ' ball had been ; and she went through it very well , with all the interest and all the commendation that could be requisite , and always putting forward to prevent Harriet ' s being obliged to say a word .
Yes , indeed , there is every thing in the world that can make her happy in it .
But still he went on measuring , and still he ended with ,
She had not advanced many yards from Mrs . Goddard ' s door , when she was met by Mr . Elton himself , evidently coming towards it , and as they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid -- of whom he , on the rumour of considerable illness , had been going to inquire , that he might carry some report of her to Hartfield -- they were overtaken by Mr . John Knightley returning from the daily visit to Donwell , with his two eldest boys , whose healthy , glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run , and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for .
She now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark .
I never heard any county but Surry called so ."
You are very obliging to say such things -- but certainly not .
She was in no hurry at all .
There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are .
Are you in any doubt as to that ?
" To be sure .
In general he was judged , throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury , with great candour ; liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man -- one who smiled so often and bowed so well ; but there was one spirit among them not to be softened , from its power of censure , by bows or smiles -- Mr . Knightley .
" He ought to come ," said Emma .
I know he would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion .
cried Mr . Elton , " what can be the meaning of this ?-- Miss Smith !-- I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my existence -- never paid her any attentions , but as your friend : never cared whether she were dead or alive , but as your friend .
Seats tolerably in the shade were found ; and now Emma was obliged to overhear what Mrs . Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of .-- A situation , a most desirable situation , was in question .
He had gone beyond the sweep -- some way along the Highbury road -- the snow was nowhere above half an inch deep -- in many places hardly enough to whiten the ground ; a very few flakes were falling at present , but the clouds were parting , and there was every appearance of its being soon over .
She is not the superior young woman which Emma ' s friend ought to be .
But whether he were entirely free from peculiar attachment -- whether there were no actual preference -- remained a little longer doubtful .
It was a very useful note , for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening .
He had time only to say ,
It is a very cold afternoon -- but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter .-- Ha !
How do you do , Miss Smith ?-- Very well I thank you .-- And I begged Mrs . Weston to come with me , that I might be sure of succeeding ."
The character of Mrs . Churchill , the grief of her husband -- her mind glanced over them both with awe and compassion -- and then rested with lightened feelings on how Frank might be affected by the event , how benefited , how freed .
But as to my _letting_ her marry Robert Martin , it is impossible ; she has refused him , and so decidedly , I think , as must prevent any second application .
What is to become of that ?-- Very true .
" And what are we to do for a proper partner for her ?"
CHAPTER XII
Mrs . Weston had , of course , formed a very favourable idea of the young man ; and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense , and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured .
That is the key to a great deal of capacity .
" Mr . Knightley ' s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare Mr . Martin with _him_ .
think a farmer , ( and with all his sense and all his merit Mr . Martin is nothing more ,) a good match for my intimate friend !
By your account , he does seem to have had some scruples .
" Well ," said he , in a deliberating manner , " for five minutes , perhaps ."
In short , she sat , during the first visit , looking at Jane Fairfax with twofold complacency ; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering justice , and was determining that she would dislike her no longer .
He was so busy the last time he was at Kingston that he quite forgot it , but he goes again to - morrow .
Captain Weston was a general favourite ; and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill , of a great Yorkshire family , and Miss Churchill fell in love with him , nobody was surprized , except her brother and his wife , who had never seen him , and who were full of pride and importance , which the connexion would offend .
.
Depend upon it , a man of six or seven - and - twenty can take care of himself ."
Emma was extremely gratified .-- They were interrupted by the bustle of Mr . Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again .
At least , however , I cannot be worse off than I should have been , if the other had been the person ; and now -- it _is_ possible --"
" I had only my own family to study from .
" Was he agreeable ?"
she cried , satisfied to have no one preferred to herself .--" You are a humourist , and may say what you like .
Yes , quite a proposal of marriage ; and a very good letter , at least she thought so .
I am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing .
His companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence , or smooth objections ; and by the time they had talked it all over together , and he had talked it all over again with Emma , in their walk back to Hartfield , he was become perfectly reconciled , and not far from thinking it the very best thing that Frank could possibly have done .
are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr .
At first , if you had not told me that more wonderful things had happened ; that there had been matches of greater disparity ( those were your very words );-- I should not have dared to give way to -- I should not have thought it possible -- But if _you_ , who had been always acquainted with him --"
I will invite your guests ."
My dear Harriet , what do you mean ?
It soon appeared that London was not the place for her .
They were going to remove immediately to Richmond .
Was not she like a daughter , his eldest daughter ?-- he must tell her ; and Miss Bates being present , it passed , of course , to Mrs . Cole , Mrs . Perry , and Mrs . Elton , immediately afterwards .
" No ," said Mr . Knightley , nearly at the same time ; " you are not often deficient ; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension .
The carriage was sent for them now .
She knows nothing herself , and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing .
CHAPTER X
Still , however , though every thing had not been accomplished by her ingenious device , she could not but flatter herself that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both , and must be leading them forward to the great event .
He was a married man , with only one living child , a girl , about Jane ' s age : and Jane became their guest , paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all ; and before she was nine years old , his daughter ' s great fondness for her , and his own wish of being a real friend , united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her education .
" You think her diffident .
You have shewn that you can dance , and you know we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper ."
They must encounter each other , and make the best of it .
Men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity -- and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in , when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed .
She went on herself , to give that portion of time to an old servant who was married , and settled in Donwell .
" The old lady !
He felt the disappointment of the young man , and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it , by the sanction he had given ; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had taken in the affair , was provoking him exceedingly .
Under that peculiar sort of dry , blunt manner , I know you have the warmest heart .
So I begged he would not -- for really as to ours being gone , I could not absolutely say that we had a great many left -- it was but half a dozen indeed ; but they should be all kept for Jane ; and I could not at all bear that he should be sending us more , so liberal as he had been already ; and Jane said the same .
Mr . Knightley was thoughtful again .
Mr . Woodhouse ' s peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill - bestowed .
I have heard her every year of our lives since we both began .
He might be superseded by another ; he certainly would indeed ; nothing could be clearer ; even a Robert Martin would have been sufficient ; but nothing else , she feared , would cure her .
" Where -- may I ask ?-- is Miss Fairfax going ?"
--
my dear , we cannot begin too early ; you are not aware of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing ."
and " John , how are you ?"
" As to the circumstances of her birth , though in a legal sense she may be called Nobody , it will not hold in common sense .
The dread of being awakened from the happiest dream , was perhaps the most prominent feeling .
She has been gone longer already than she intended ."
" I am very much astonished , Mr . Elton .
Mrs . and Miss Bates occupied the drawing - room floor ; and there , in the very moderate - sized apartment , which was every thing to them , the visitors were most cordially and even gratefully welcomed ; the quiet neat old lady , who with her knitting was seated in the warmest corner , wanting even to give up her place to Miss Woodhouse , and her more active , talking daughter , almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness , thanks for their visit , solicitude for their shoes , anxious inquiries after Mr . Woodhouse ' s health , cheerful communications about her mother ' s , and sweet - cake from the beaufet --" Mrs . Cole had just been there , just called in for ten minutes , and had been so good as to sit an hour with them , and _she_ had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she liked it very much ; and , therefore , she hoped Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too ."
" Take it ," said Emma , smiling , and pushing the paper towards Harriet --" it is for you .
" Very well ; and if he had intended to give her one , he would have told her so ."
" You are right .
" My dear , how am I to get so far ?
" Oh !
You will not be sorry to find yourself at home ."
I should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty , and she would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement .-- But I had no choice .
The most indefatigable , true friend .
He seemed hardly to hear her ; he was thoughtful -- and in a manner which shewed him not pleased , soon afterwards said ,
She was delighted to see her father look comfortable , and very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well ; but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated .
That will just do for me , you know .
There is no hurry at all .
