He began -- stopping , however , almost directly to say , " Had I been offered the sight of one of this gentleman ' s letters to his mother - in - law a few months ago , Emma , it would not have been taken with such indifference ."
The truth of this representation there was no denying .
A little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear .
" Oh !
The introduction must be unpleasant , whenever it takes place ; and the sooner it could be over , the better ."
They were laying themselves open to that very phrase -- and to having it sent off in a letter to Maple Grove by one lady , to Ireland by another .
Do not you begin to feel that now ?
" Yes , yes -- but I am amused that he should have seen so far into my feelings .
The style of the letter was much above her expectation .
"' Tis twelve ; I shall not forget to think of you four hours hence ; and by this time to - morrow , perhaps , or a little later , I may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here .
It is not in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of Knightley ."
" Good Heaven !"
Emma pondered a moment , and then replied , " I will not pretend _not_ to understand you ; and to give you all the relief in my power , be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me , as you are apprehensive of ."
Every letter from her is read forty times over ; her compliments to all friends go round and round again ; and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher , or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother , one hears of nothing else for a month .
" There is my news :-- I thought it would interest you ," said Mr . Knightley , with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of what had passed between them .
Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could , with thorough self - approbation , recommend ; though he might constrain himself , while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things , to say :
evil to some is always good to others .
" Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning ?-- Do , if it be possible .
He will think all the happiness , all the advantage , on your side of the question ; all the merit on mine .
said Mrs . Weston , " have not you finished it yet ?
" Oh , what a sweet house !-- How very beautiful !-- There are the yellow curtains that Miss Nash admires so much ."
After tea , Mr . and Mrs . Weston , and Mr . Elton sat down with Mr . Woodhouse to cards .
Had he begun as he ought , there would have been no difficulty now ."
His mother and sisters were very fond of him .
Never had she felt so agitated , mortified , grieved , at any circumstance in her life .
You wrote me word of it three months ago ."
Impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort ; if we except , perhaps , Mrs . Suckling ' s own family , and Mrs . Bragge ' s ; but Mrs . Smallridge is intimate with both , and in the very same neighbourhood :-- lives only four miles from Maple Grove .
It was folly to be disturbed by it .
Donwell and Randalls had received their invitation , and none had come for her father and herself ; and Mrs . Weston ' s accounting for it with " I suppose they will not take the liberty with you ; they know you do not dine out ," was not quite sufficient .
You and Miss Fairfax gave us some very good music .
They were so deserving , that a _little_ higher should have been enough : but as it was , how could she have done otherwise ?-- Impossible !-- She could not repent .
yes , and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance .
It has hurt his father equally .
And now I come to the principal , the only important part of my conduct while belonging to you , which excites my own anxiety , or requires very solicitous explanation .
And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield , so convenient for even solitary female walking , and in Mr . Weston ' s disposition and circumstances , which would make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week together .
It will not do to _invite_ five couple .
It was hot ; and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered , dispersed way , scarcely any three together , they insensibly followed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of limes , which stretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the river , seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds .-- It led to nothing ; nothing but a view at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars , which seemed intended , in their erection , to give the appearance of an approach to the house , which never had been there .
She had frequently thought -- especially since his father ' s marriage with Miss Taylor -- that if she _were_ to marry , he was the very person to suit her in age , character and condition .
" My dear Jane , say no more about it .
She was vexed .
And yet it was far , very far , from impossible .-- Was it a new circumstance for a man of first - rate abilities to be captivated by very inferior powers ?
But she had believed them to be well - meaning , worthy people before ; and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion ?
They met readily and smiling , but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said ; and having all sat down again , there was for some time such a blank in the circle , that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged , which she had long felt , of seeing Frank Churchill once more , and of seeing him with Jane , would yield its proportion of pleasure .
Mrs . Perry was always particularly fond of my mother -- indeed I do not know who is not -- and she had mentioned it to her in confidence ; she had no objection to her telling us , of course , but it was not to go beyond : and , from that day to this , I never mentioned it to a soul that I know of .
It would have killed me never to come to Hartfield any more !"
So she thought at first ;-- but a little consideration convinced her that every thing need not be put off .
This is a matter of mere common politeness and good - breeding , and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry ."
" Ever since the day -- about four years ago -- that Miss Taylor and I met with him in Broadway Lane , when , because it began to drizzle , he darted away with so much gallantry , and borrowed two umbrellas for us from Farmer Mitchell ' s , I made up my mind on the subject .
It is a pity that they were ever got over ."
she cried .--" And such weather for exploring !-- These delays and disappointments are quite odious .
Will you ?
Harriet was on the point of leaving the room , and only stopt to say , with a very interesting naivete ,
There was a little hesitation in Emma ' s answer .
She hoped they might now become friends again .
Living constantly with right - minded and well - informed people , her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline and culture ; and Colonel Campbell ' s residence being in London , every lighter talent had been done full justice to , by the attendance of first - rate masters .
Time , you may be sure , will make one or the other of us think differently ; and , in the meanwhile , we need not talk much on the subject ."
Harriet was remembered only from being _her_ friend .
A piece of paper was found on the table this morning --( dropt , we suppose , by a fairy )-- containing a very pretty charade , and we have just copied it in ."
She held the parcel towards her , and Emma read the words _Most_ _precious_ _treasures_ on the top .
" Yes , she would be , but that she thinks there will be another put - off .
Gone to Mr . Woodhouse ' s .
Let me entreat you to run no risks .
" Sir ," said Mr . Woodhouse , rather warmly , " you are very much mistaken if you suppose Mr . Perry to be that sort of character .
You appear to me a little hoarse already , and when you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues to - morrow will bring , I think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to - night ."
And who but Mr . Knightley could know and bear with Mr . Woodhouse , so as to make such an arrangement desirable !-- The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr . Woodhouse had been always felt in her husband ' s plans and her own , for a marriage between Frank and Emma .
She does not depend upon his coming so much as I do : but she does not know the parties so well as I do .
She was obliged to stop and think .
This was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by , and Mr . Weston , with a very good grace , immediately exclaimed ,
She went , however ; and when they reached the farm , and she was to be put down , at the end of the broad , neat gravel walk , which led between espalier apple - trees to the front door , the sight of every thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before , was beginning to revive a little local agitation ; and when they parted , Emma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity , which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour .
Her father ' s comfort was amply secured , Mrs . Bates as well as Mrs . Goddard being able to come ; and her last pleasing duty , before she left the house , was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after dinner ; and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her dress , to make the two ladies all the amends in her power , by helping them to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine , for whatever unwilling self - denial his care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise during the meal .-- She had provided a plentiful dinner for them ; she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it .
And all the grandeur of the connexion seemed dependent on the elder sister , who was _very_ _well_ _married_ , to a gentleman in a _great_ _way_ , near Bristol , who kept two carriages !
was her immediate exclamation .
The strength of the song falls on the second ."
Every body who sees it is struck by its beauty ; but to me , it has been quite a home .
Well , I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland ."
On the contrary , her plans and proceedings were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general appearances of the next few days .
The first error and the worst lay at her door .
_She_ could not .
."
" Thank you ," said he , in an accent of deep mortification , and not another syllable followed .
That was your doing , papa .
William Larkins is such an old acquaintance !
I have never seen either Mr . or Mrs . Elton .
It darted through her , with the speed of an arrow , that Mr . Knightley must marry no one but herself !
" Oh !
Mr . Woodhouse hesitated .--" Not near so often , my dear , as I could wish ."
" Mr . Knightley ," said Emma , trying to be lively , but really confused -- " I am in a very extraordinary situation .
Mrs . Perry had told somebody , and was extremely happy about it .
" Not Harriet ' s equal !"
Oh !
" Well , Miss Woodhouse ," said Harriet , when they had quitted the house , and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin ; " Well , Miss Woodhouse , ( with a gentle sigh ,) what do you think of her ?-- Is not she very charming ?"
" Thank you , thank you .-- This is just what I wanted to be assured of .-- Oh !
" Upon my word ," exclaimed Emma , " you amuse me !
She soon resolved , equally as a duty and a pleasure , to employ half an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax .-- She ought to go -- and she was longing to see her ; the resemblance of their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill .
That it was time for every body to go , concluded the subject ; and with a short final arrangement for the next day ' s scheme , they parted .
You may imagine how desirable !
It is the fault of her face that she has them not ."
When people come into a beautiful country of this sort , you know , Miss Woodhouse , one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible ; and Mr . Suckling is extremely fond of exploring .
I was sure it could not be far off ; but I had put my huswife upon it , you see , without being aware , and so it was quite hid , but I had it in my hand so very lately that I was almost sure it must be on the table .
She is playing _Robin_ _Adair_ at this moment -- _his_ favourite ."
