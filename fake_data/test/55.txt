How well you put it on !-- so gratified !
" There does , indeed , seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present ," said Mrs . Weston , " as can well be ; and while she is so happy at Hartfield , I cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor Mr . Woodhouse ' s account .
" I have escaped ; and that I should escape , may be a matter of grateful wonder to you and myself .
Nothing , but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future .
Well , I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland ."
" _My_ report from Mrs . Goddard ' s ," said she presently , " was not so pleasant as I had hoped --` Not better ' was _my_ answer ."
" Was he agreeable ?"
It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin .
A disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips , but I am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood ."
Was it impossible ?-- No .-- Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in understanding ; but he had been very much struck with the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner ; and all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour .-- For Harriet , it would be advantageous and delightful indeed .
CHAPTER VIII
I shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way ."
" To be sure .
.
Kitty , a fair but frozen maid , Kindled a flame I yet deplore , The hood - wink ' d boy I called to aid , Though of his near approach afraid , So fatal to my suit before .
She heard enough to know that Mr . Weston was giving some information about his son ; she heard the words " my son ," and " Frank ," and " my son ," repeated several times over ; and , from a few other half - syllables very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son ; but before she could quiet Mr . Elton , the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her would have been awkward .
CHAPTER I
" It was her very particular friend , you know ."
And how suffer him to leave her without saying one word of gratitude , of concurrence , of common kindness !
I hope you turned directly ."
CHAPTER V
I have some notion of putting such a trimming as this to my white and silver poplin .
" Emma knows I never flatter her ," said Mr . Knightley , " but I meant no reflection on any body .
Well , I shall bring Jane with me -- Jane and her aunt .-- The rest I leave to you .
It had been serviceable in deadening the first shock , without retaining any influence to alarm .
Emma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little blush .
Never had the exquisite sight , smell , sensation of nature , tranquil , warm , and brilliant after a storm , been more attractive to her .
my dear ; but so much as Patty has to do !-- And it is a kindness to employ our men ."
Can I do any thing for you ?"
" No , I thank you .
I know what thorough justice you will do it , and have scarcely a doubt of its happy effect .-- I think we shall never materially disagree about the writer again ; but I will not delay you by a long preface .-- We are quite well .-- This letter has been the cure of all the little nervousness I have been feeling lately .-- I did not quite like your looks on Tuesday , but it was an ungenial morning ; and though you will never own being affected by weather , I think every body feels a north - east wind .-- I felt for your dear father very much in the storm of Tuesday afternoon and yesterday morning , but had the comfort of hearing last night , by Mr . Perry , that it had not made him ill . " Yours ever , " A . W ."
I assure you mine are very different .
He shook his head with a smile , and looked as if he had very little doubt and very little mercy .
" It is so cold , so very cold -- and looks and feels so very much like snow , that if it were to any other place or with any other party , I should really try not to go out to - day -- and dissuade my father from venturing ; but as he has made up his mind , and does not seem to feel the cold himself , I do not like to interfere , as I know it would be so great a disappointment to Mr . and Mrs . Weston .
" I think her all you describe .
I wonder who the friend was -- and who could be the young lady .
" My dear Harriet , you must not refine too much upon this charade .-- You will betray your feelings improperly , if you are too conscious and too quick , and appear to affix more meaning , or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it .
But you see , every thing turns out for the best .
I hoped I was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description .
She asked after their mutual friends ; they were all well .-- When had he left them ?-- Only that morning .
But I have done with expecting any course of steady reading from Emma .
I knew he would !"
You must answer it of course -- and speedily ."
He promised to join me here , and pay his respects to you ."
" My dear Miss Woodhouse , a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act .
" Aye , we men are sad fellows .
I know he had horses to - day -- for we arrived together ; and I laughed at him about it , but he said not a word that could betray ."
They had received her doubtingly , if not coolly ; and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time -- till just at last , when Mrs . Martin ' s saying , all of a sudden , that she thought Miss Smith was grown , had brought on a more interesting subject , and a warmer manner .
He thought much of the evils of the journey for her , and not a little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some of the party the last half of the way ; but his alarms were needless ; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished , and Mr . and Mrs . John Knightley , their five children , and a competent number of nursery - maids , all reaching Hartfield in safety .
He knows he is wrong , and has nothing rational to urge .-- Bad .-- He ought not to have formed the engagement .--` His father ' s disposition :'-- he is unjust , however , to his father .
He was a nervous man , easily depressed ; fond of every body that he was used to , and hating to part with them ; hating change of every kind .
She merely said , in the course of some trivial chat , " Well , Harriet , whenever you marry I would advise you to do so and so "-- and thought no more of it , till after a minute ' s silence she heard Harriet say in a very serious tone , " I shall never marry ."
Fairfax of the _______ regiment of infantry , and Miss Jane Bates , had had its day of fame and pleasure , hope and interest ; but nothing now remained of it , save the melancholy remembrance of him dying in action abroad -- of his widow sinking under consumption and grief soon afterwards -- and this girl .
I am extremely happy .
She had a little beauty and a little accomplishment , but so little judgment that she thought herself coming with superior knowledge of the world , to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood ; and conceived Miss Hawkins to have held such a place in society as Mrs . Elton ' s consequence only could surpass .
I believe he is one of the very best - tempered men that ever existed .
Mr . Knightley grew angry .
Goldsmith tells us , that when lovely woman stoops to folly , she has nothing to do but to die ; and when she stoops to be disagreeable , it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill - fame .
I saw the word , and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one , and so very distressing to the other ."
A better written letter , Harriet ( returning it ,) than I had expected ."
CHAPTER X
He is desperately in love and means to marry her ."
that I had never seen her !"
The regular and best families Emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite -- neither Donwell , nor Hartfield , nor Randalls .
" Ah !
" I do not know why you should say so .
Even pleasure , you know , is fatiguing -- and I cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it .
We were always glad to see him at Hartfield ."
" I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother ," cried Emma , " about your friend Mr . Graham ' s intending to have a bailiff from Scotland , to look after his new estate .
She had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself .
I never shall forget his manner .
" My father and Mrs . Weston are at the Crown at this moment ," said Frank Churchill , " examining the capabilities of the house .
Much , much beyond impropriety !-- It has sunk him , I cannot say how it has sunk him in my opinion .
Very well ; I shall not attempt to deny Emma ' s being pretty ."
" Insufferable woman !"
" I have no doubt of it ."
If it can be contrived to be at the Crown , papa , it will be very convenient for the horses .
Was not she the whole day with you ?"
Oh !
My acquaintance with him has been but trifling .-- And even if I have not underrated him hitherto , he may yet turn out well .-- With such a woman he has a chance .-- I have no motive for wishing him ill -- and for her sake , whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct , I shall certainly wish him well ."
She felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant , as she viewed the respectable size and style of the building , its suitable , becoming , characteristic situation , low and sheltered -- its ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream , of which the Abbey , with all the old neglect of prospect , had scarcely a sight -- and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues , which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up .-- The house was larger than Hartfield , and totally unlike it , covering a good deal of ground , rambling and irregular , with many comfortable , and one or two handsome rooms .-- It was just what it ought to be , and it looked what it was -- and Emma felt an increasing respect for it , as the residence of a family of such true gentility , untainted in blood and understanding .-- Some faults of temper John Knightley had ; but Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably .
We are both prejudiced ; you against , I for him ; and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here ."
The older a person grows , Harriet , the more important it is that their manners should not be bad ; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness , or coarseness , or awkwardness becomes .
What a pity it is that Mr . Weston ever thought of her !"
" Oh !"
Then turning to Isabella , who had not been attending before --" You must know , my dear Mrs . Knightley , that we are by no means so sure of seeing Mr . Frank Churchill , in my opinion , as his father thinks .
" Only one more , papa ; only for Mr . Elton .
He is an excellent young man , both as son and brother .
A few more to - morrows , and the party from London would be arriving .
He paused .-- She coloured and laughed .--" I know you saw my letter , and think you may remember my wish in your favour .
said Mr . Woodhouse , always the last to make his way in conversation ; " then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady .
" Yes , I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him ."
Such a beautiful hind - quarter of pork !
There , it is done .
In that case , nothing could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on .
Selina says it is quite horror to her -- and I believe I have caught a little of her nicety .
Mr . Weston certainly would never marry again .
The touch seemed immediate .
" You , Emma , who have so few opportunities of dancing , you are really out of luck ; you are very much out of luck !"
" Oh !
