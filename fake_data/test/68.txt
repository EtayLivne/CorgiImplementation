It was the end of an old pencil ,-- the part without any lead .
It is a great deal more natural than one could wish , that a young man , brought up by those who are proud , luxurious , and selfish , should be proud , luxurious , and selfish too .
Weston may grow cross from the wantonness of comfort , or his son may plague him ."
And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield , so convenient for even solitary female walking , and in Mr . Weston ' s disposition and circumstances , which would make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week together .
" In short ," said he , " perhaps , Miss Woodhouse -- I think you can hardly be quite without suspicion "--
It was made a great favour of ; and altogether it was more than I could bear ; and so I never would finish it , to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness , to every morning visitor in Brunswick Square ;-- and , as I said , I did then forswear ever drawing any body again .
Mrs . Elton ' s invitations I should have imagined any thing but inviting ."
My dear Miss Woodhouse -- I come quite over - powered .
He could not believe her to be encouraging him .
I really am ashamed of always leading the way ."
" Oh !
Emma called on her the next day , and found her doom already signed with regard to Randalls .
And Mr . Dixon seems a very charming young man , quite worthy of him .
I cannot see you acting wrong , without a remonstrance .
Is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers ; and has not Mrs . Weston some inimitable figure - pieces in her drawing - room , at Randalls ?"
" He appears rough to you ," said Emma , " because you are so very gentle yourself ; but if you could compare him with other papas , you would not think him rough .
" Here is April come !"
They have no indoors man , else they do not want for any thing ; and Mrs . Martin talks of taking a boy another year ."
" Yes , certainly it does .
He never read the Romance of the Forest , nor The Children of the Abbey .
She and Mrs . Weston were obliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together .
And Mr . Weston at the same time , walking briskly with long steps through the passage , was calling out ,
It is not likely you should ever have observed him ; but he knows you very well indeed -- I mean by sight ."
She saw , that in persuading herself , in fancying , in acting to the contrary , she had been entirely under a delusion , totally ignorant of her own heart -- and , in short , that she had never really cared for Frank Churchill at all !
I speak as a friend , Emma .
Mrs . Weston , you would be quite laid up ; do not let them talk of such a wild thing .
Every body is so surprized ; and every body says the same obliging things .
Not one of them had the power of removal , or of effecting any material change of society .
" So very kind !"
So much the better .
" But , my dear papa , you are no friend to matrimony ; and therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _bride_ ?
Mrs . Weston had been delighted before , and was delighted again ; Emma joined her in all her praise ; and the pianoforte , with every proper discrimination , was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise .
Mr . Knightley had spoken prophetically , when he once said , " Emma , you have been no friend to Harriet Smith ."
She promised him again and again to come -- much oftener than he doubted -- and was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy , such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it .
" Oh !
They were a couple worth looking at .
This made a difficulty .
" Oh !
Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet ' s fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose , for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr . Elton ' s being a remarkably handsome man , with most agreeable manners ; and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints , she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on Harriet ' s side , as there could be any occasion for .
If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment , I have nothing to say against it , but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me .-- Oh !
" Something that would do !"
" I am not speaking of its prudence ; merely its probability ."
Once , I felt the fire rather too much ; but then I moved back my chair a little , a very little , and it did not disturb me .
She must not appear to think it a misfortune .-- With all the spirits she could command , she prepared him first for something strange , and then , in a few words , said , that if his consent and approbation could be obtained -- which , she trusted , would be attended with no difficulty , since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all -- she and Mr . Knightley meant to marry ; by which means Hartfield would receive the constant addition of that person ' s company whom she knew he loved , next to his daughters and Mrs . Weston , best in the world .
" I did ," replied Emma , " and they cannot forgive me ."
I knew it was -- but had not resolution enough to part with them ."
Well , I shall bring Jane with me -- Jane and her aunt .-- The rest I leave to you .
In what respect ?
" I do think it is , without exception , the best charade I ever read ."
Let us be discreet -- quite on our good behaviour .-- Hush !-- You remember those lines -- I forget the poem at this moment :
" From the very circumstance of its being larger , sir .
That is , I know you must have seen her a hundred times -- but are you acquainted ?"
It is a retired place .
I never met with her equal .
The persons to be invited , required little thought .
" This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements , sir .
I doubt whether he will return the compliment , and discover her to be a lady .
It was a done thing ; Mr . Elton was to go , and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment ; never had his smile been stronger , nor his eyes more exulting than when he next looked at her .
But poor Mrs . Bates had a bad cold about a month ago ."
So very odd we should happen to meet !
It is the fault of her face that she has them not ."
A week had not passed since Miss Hawkins ' s name was first mentioned in Highbury , before she was , by some means or other , discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind ; to be handsome , elegant , highly accomplished , and perfectly amiable : and when Mr . Elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects , and circulate the fame of her merits , there was very little more for him to do , than to tell her Christian name , and say whose music she principally played .
She owned that , considering every thing , she was not absolutely without inclination for the party .
But he is not the only gentleman you have been lately used to .
But do not imagine that I want to influence you ."
" Pray , Emma ," said he , " may I ask in what lay the great amusement , the poignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax ?
While he staid , the Martins were forgotten ; and on the very morning of his setting off for Bath again , Emma , to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned , judged it best for her to return Elizabeth Martin ' s visit .
I always fetch the letters when I am here .
The evening was quiet and conversable , as Mr . Woodhouse declined cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear Isabella , and the little party made two natural divisions ; on one side he and his daughter ; on the other the two Mr . Knightleys ; their subjects totally distinct , or very rarely mixing -- and Emma only occasionally joining in one or the other .
cried Harriet .
" If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women , and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with them , as you are where these children are concerned , we might always think alike ."
I am all amazement !
There are places in town , offices , where inquiry would soon produce something -- Offices for the sale -- not quite of human flesh -- but of human intellect ."
I never met with a disposition more truly amiable ."
Oh !
" Oh !
" He is very young to settle ," was Mr . Woodhouse ' s observation .
" And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess ?-- I pity you .-- I thought you cleverer -- for , depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck .
" They would have solicited the honour earlier , but had been waiting the arrival of a folding - screen from London , which they hoped might keep Mr . Woodhouse from any draught of air , and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour of his company ."
" I rather wonder that it was never made before ."
Emma was in no danger of forgetting .
Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr . Woodhouse ' s family , less as a governess than a friend , very fond of both daughters , but particularly of Emma .
Yes , quite a proposal of marriage ; and a very good letter , at least she thought so .
Here is my sketch of the fourth , who was a baby .
Mr . Weston is really as kind as herself .
She had no visible friends but what had been acquired at Highbury , and was now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her .
A situation such as you deserve , and your friends would require for you , is no everyday occurrence , is not obtained at a moment ' s notice ; indeed , indeed , we must begin inquiring directly ."
yes -- very -- a very pleasing young woman ."
Well , Frank , your dream certainly shews that Highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent .
She was afterwards looking for her shawl -- Frank Churchill was looking also -- it was growing dusk , and the room was in confusion ; and how they parted , Mr . Knightley could not tell .
Emma wished to go to work directly , and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts at portraits , for not one of them had ever been finished , that they might decide together on the best size for Harriet .
It is impossible ."
" And while Mrs . Weston pays her visit , I may be allowed , I hope ," said Frank Churchill , " to join your party and wait for her at Hartfield -- if you are going home ."
He was to leave them early the next day ; and he soon began with --
Now , as her objection was nothing but her very great dislike of Mrs . Elton , of which Mr . Weston must already be perfectly aware , it was not worth bringing forward again :-- it could not be done without a reproof to him , which would be giving pain to his wife ; and she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she would have done a great deal to avoid ; an arrangement which would probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of Mrs . Elton ' s party !
She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt , very worthy people ; I have known them all my life .
" But they like it , papa ; there is nothing they like so much .
Before she had committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane Fairfax , or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors , than saying to Mr . Knightley , " She certainly is handsome ; she is better than handsome !"
" I never saw any gentleman ' s handwriting "-- Emma began , looking also at Mrs . Weston ; but stopped , on perceiving that Mrs . Weston was attending to some one else -- and the pause gave her time to reflect , " Now , how am I going to introduce him ?-- Am I unequal to speaking his name at once before all these people ?
" How d ' ye do ?-- how d ' ye do ?-- Very well , I thank you .
