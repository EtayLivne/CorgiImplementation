It is too unlikely , for me to believe it without proof ."
I have not the smallest doubt of the issue .
I assure you I have .
If I come , I shall be cross ."
Mrs . Churchill rules at Enscombe , and is a very odd - tempered woman ; and his coming now , depends upon her being willing to spare him ."
and A .-- Em - ma .-- Do you understand ?"
With all my heart .
cried Harriet .
It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his schemes ; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth , it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase Randalls , and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to ; but he had gone steadily on , with these objects in view , till they were accomplished .
I really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else ."
Such a debasement on his !
He had returned to a late dinner , after some days ' absence , and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were well in Brunswick Square .
Every thing tender and charming was to mark their parting ; but still they were to part .
" The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me .
Had she intended ever to _marry_ him , it might have been worth while to pause and consider , and try to understand the value of his preference , and the character of his temper ; but for all the purposes of their acquaintance , he was quite amiable enough .
They met with the utmost friendliness .
No !
Emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject .
" And I am sure I should never want to go there ; for I am never happy but at Hartfield ."
I am sure Mr . Elton will lose no time in calling on him ; and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage ."
She always travels with her own sheets ; an excellent precaution .
He may have as strong a sense of what would be right , as you can have , without being so equal , under particular circumstances , to act up to it ."
She was so surprized she did not know what to do .
Mr . Knightley saw no such passion , and of course thought nothing of its effects ; but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest ; and more than a reasonable , becoming degree of prudence , she was very sure did not belong to Mr . Elton .
Soon afterwards he began again ,
Humph -- Harriet ' s ready wit !
" And while Mrs . Weston pays her visit , I may be allowed , I hope ," said Frank Churchill , " to join your party and wait for her at Hartfield -- if you are going home ."
" I dare say your apologies were accepted , sir .
-- She was afraid she had done her nothing but disservice .-- It was true that she had not to charge herself , in this instance as in the former , with being the sole and original author of the mischief ; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered Harriet ' s imagination ; for Harriet had acknowledged her admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she had ever given her a hint on the subject ; but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed .
poor Jane is ill !'
" It is my duty , and I am sure it is my wish ," she continued , " to have no reserves with you on this subject .
No doubt he is a sensible man , and I suppose may have a natural talent for -- thinks strongly and clearly -- and when he takes a pen in hand , his thoughts naturally find proper words .
Resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father , from which she was so pointedly excluded .
" You mean to return a favourable answer , I collect ."
Its character as a ball - room caught him ; and instead of passing on , he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed windows which were open , to look in and contemplate its capabilities , and lament that its original purpose should have ceased .
In general , it was a very well approved match .
Our coachman and horses are so extremely expeditious !-- I believe we drive faster than any body .-- What a pleasure it is to send one ' s carriage for a friend !-- I understand you were so kind as to offer , but another time it will be quite unnecessary .
I have often known it done myself ."
" I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love ."
" Six years hence !
" Upon my word !
As for Isabella , she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the Mr . Westons aside as much as she can ."
He has those to please who must be pleased , and who ( between ourselves ) are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices .
Beyond it she would on no account proceed .
I am only afraid of your sitting up for me .
I hope whenever poor Isabella ' s little ones have the measles , she will send for Perry ."
Had not Mrs . Weston any letter about her to produce ?"
Frank Churchill returned to his station by Emma ; and as soon as Miss Bates was quiet , she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse of Mrs . Elton and Miss Fairfax , who were standing a little way behind her .-- He was thoughtful .
" Yes , he has been gone just four weeks , as you observe , Miss Woodhouse ," said Miss Bates , " four weeks yesterday .-- A Miss Hawkins !-- Well , I had always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts ; not that I ever -- Mrs . Cole once whispered to me -- but I immediately said , ` No , Mr . Elton is a most worthy young man -- but '-- In short , I do not think I am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries .
His company so sought after , that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it ; that he has more invitations than there are days in the week .
What shall I say ?"
He had , in fact , been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence .
CHAPTER XV
But you really frightened me .
I must order the carriage .
And after such success , you know !-- Every body said that Mr . Weston would never marry again .
" Do you dare to suppose me so great a blockhead , as not to know what a man is talking of ?-- What do you deserve ?"
Even if this family , the Braithwaites , are put off , I am still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us .
My right to place myself in a situation requiring such concealment , is another question .
She never stopt till she had gone through the whole ; and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong , yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed -- and he had suffered , and was very sorry -- and he was so grateful to Mrs . Weston , and so much in love with Miss Fairfax , and she was so happy herself , that there was no being severe ; and could he have entered the room , she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever .
Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet ' s fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose , for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr . Elton ' s being a remarkably handsome man , with most agreeable manners ; and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints , she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on Harriet ' s side , as there could be any occasion for .
Donwell was famous for its strawberry - beds , which seemed a plea for the invitation : but no plea was necessary ; cabbage - beds would have been enough to tempt the lady , who only wanted to be going somewhere .
I am sure Miss Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant , Emma .
If one thinks of all that it has to do , and all that it does so well , it is really astonishing !"
by the bye ," then sinking his voice , and looking demure for the moment --" I hope Mr . Knightley is well ?"
Ladies and gentlemen -- I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say , that she waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of , and only requires something very entertaining from each of you , in a general way .
And as to conceit , he is the farthest from it of any man I know .
A worthy employment for a young lady ' s mind !
I shall sit by you .
What shall I say ?"
When once it had been read , there was no doing any thing , but lament and exclaim .
He was soon pretty well resigned .
Nobody can be more devoted to home than I am .
dear -- I think you play the best of the two .
Her visit to Abbey - Mill , this summer , seems to have done his business .
" Oh !
I never saw Mrs . Weston better in my life -- never looking so well .
Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived the former good old days of the room ?-- She who could do any thing in Highbury !
Where I have a regard , I always think a person well - looking .
She knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than she could perform with credit ; she wanted neither taste nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable , and could accompany her own voice well .
Mr . Weston , his son , Emma , and Harriet , only remained ; and the young man ' s spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant .
Mr . Knightley , is not she ?"
The appearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight ; and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart , and the solicitude of Mrs . Elton to have _her_ carriage first , were gladly endured , in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure .
But you see , every thing turns out for the best .
Soft is the very word for her eye -- of all epithets , the justest that could be given .
" You are prepared for the worst , I see -- and very bad it is .
There is great fear , great caution , great resolution somewhere .-- She is _not_ to be with the _Dixons_ .
Neither father nor mother could promote , and the daughter could not endure it .
Frank ' s was the first idea ; and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it ; for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties , and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance .
Name your day , and I will come .
She saw it all ; and entering into her feelings , promoted her quitting the house immediately , and watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend .
He was not a great favourite with his fair sister - in - law .
" We cannot suppose ," said Emma , smiling , " that Mr . Elton would hesitate to assure you of there being a _very_ musical society in Highbury ; and I hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be pardoned , in consideration of the motive ."
The information was , as you state , that he was going to be married to a Miss Hawkins .
At last Emma attacked her on another ground .
" Very well ; I will not plague you any more .
Harriet listened , and Emma drew in peace .
" Me !"
Latterly , however -- for some time , indeed -- I have had no idea of their meaning any thing .-- I thought them a habit , a trick , nothing that called for seriousness on my side .
I have engaged Mrs . Weston to correspond with me .
