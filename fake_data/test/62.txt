" I am glad you think I have been useful to her ; but Harriet only wanted drawing out , and receiving a few , very few hints .
" He is a most fortunate man !"
It was very natural for you to say , what right has he to lecture me ?-- and I am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner .
He may be sure of every woman ' s approbation while he writes with such gallantry ."
If she has fancied otherwise , her own wishes have misled her , and I am very sorry -- extremely sorry -- But , Miss Smith , indeed !-- Oh !
Weston !-- Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a gentlewoman !
He is an excellent young man , both as son and brother .
She speaks a little too quick .
And Elizabeth , too .
Mr . Elton , my astonishment is much beyond any thing I can express .
" As a friend !"
" No , I am sure it is not from the Campbells .
" That ' s true ," she cried --" very true .
Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be expected ; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits , which appeared perfectly natural , as there was a dentist to be consulted ; but , since that business had been over , she did not appear to find Harriet different from what she had known her before .-- Isabella , to be sure , was no very quick observer ; yet if Harriet had not been equal to playing with the children , it would not have escaped her .
" Well , I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does , or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out .
But in every respect , as she saw more of her , she approved her , and was confirmed in all her kind designs .
Oh , said I , Patty do not come with your bad news to me .
We are rather out of distance of the very striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of ; and we are a very quiet set of people , I believe ; more disposed to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure ."
But , however , I found afterwards from Patty , that William said it was all the apples of _that_ sort his master had ; he had brought them all -- and now his master had not one left to bake or boil .
Why was it so much worse that Harriet should be in love with Mr . Knightley , than with Frank Churchill ?
" Emma , I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do : a privilege rather endured than allowed , perhaps , but I must still use it .
with the help of spectacles .
Mrs . Perry had told somebody , and was extremely happy about it .
" Mrs . Gilbert does not mean to dance , but there is a young lady disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing -- Miss Smith ."
By only raising my voice , and saying any thing two or three times over , she is sure to hear ; but then she is used to my voice .
You must answer it of course -- and speedily ."
" Dear me !-- How should I ever have borne it !
That she was not immediately ready , Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves ; she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion ; she must reason herself into the power of performance ; and Emma could not but pity such feelings , whatever their origin , and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again .
A disagreeable truth would be palatable through her lips , but I am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood ."
Let them be sent to Donwell .
" I shall be very glad to look it over ," said he ; " but it seems long .
How does Miss Smith do ?
Be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and the children , and let me look as I chuse ."
" And now that I understand your question , I must pronounce it to be a very unfair one .
He ought to have opposed the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father .
" How much I am obliged to you ," said he , " for telling me to come to - day !-- If it had not been for you , I should certainly have lost all the happiness of this party .
They , in their different homes , and their different ways , might be looking back on it with pleasure ; but in her view it was a morning more completely misspent , more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time , and more to be abhorred in recollection , than any she had ever passed .
Mr . Woodhouse was resigned .
He was gone immediately ; and Emma soon saw him standing before Miss Fairfax , and talking to her ; but as to its effect on the young lady , as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them , exactly in front of Miss Fairfax , she could absolutely distinguish nothing .
" My dear , you are too particular ," said her husband .
CHAPTER IX
He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived more evil than good from them .
" Well , I have so little confidence in my own judgment , that whenever I marry , I hope some body will chuse my wife for me .
If _she_ had so misinterpreted his feelings , she had little right to wonder that _he_ , with self - interest to blind him , should have mistaken hers .
Well , sir , the time must come when you will be paid for all this , when you will have little labour and great enjoyment ."
there is one difficulty unprovided for ," cried Emma .
Then she is no rule for Mrs . Churchill , who is as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld ."
Mr . Elton was all obligation and cheerfulness ; he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed , that she began to think he must have received a different account of Harriet from what had reached her .
Harriet smiled again , and her smiles grew stronger .
She could never quit him ."
Mr . Knightley suspected in Frank Churchill the determination of catching her eye -- he seemed watching her intently -- in vain , however , if it were so -- Jane passed between them into the hall , and looked at neither .
He did speak yesterday -- that is , he wrote , and was refused ."
But there is nobody hereabouts to attach her ; and she goes so seldom from home ."
" If so , you must extend your suspicions and comprehend _Mr_ .
She gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence ; but was really obliged to put an end to it , and request him to place himself elsewhere .
If she can hesitate as to ` Yes ,' she ought to say ` No ' directly .
" Nay , dear Emma , now I must take his part ; for though he has been wrong in this instance , I have known him long enough to answer for his having many , very many , good qualities ; and --"
Harriet ' s staying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy .
It could not be otherwise .
Yet he would speak .
Your description of Mrs . Churchill made me think of them directly .
The beginning , however , of every visit displayed none but the properest feelings , and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality .
" Well , there _is_ feeling here .-- He does seem to have suffered in finding her ill .-- Certainly , I can have no doubt of his being fond of her .
Do not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration .
She was pleased , on taking leave , to find Miss Fairfax determined to attend her out of the room , to go with her even downstairs ; it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of , to say ,
She was your governess , I think ?"
They would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself ; Mr . Martin may be the richest of the two , but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in society .-- The sphere in which she moves is much above his .-- It would be a degradation ."
" I do not understand what you mean by ` success ,'" said Mr . Knightley .
He could say no more ; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him , returned with Mrs . Weston to Mrs . Bates ' s door .
-- If he would say so to her at once , in the tone of decision becoming a man , there would be no opposition made to his going ."
the coldness of a Jane Fairfax !-- Harriet is worth a hundred such -- And for a wife -- a sensible man ' s wife -- it is invaluable .
" He has been wanting to come to us ," continued Mr . Weston , " ever since September : every letter has been full of it ; but he cannot command his own time .
A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked , or because he is attached to her , and can write a tolerable letter ."
the proper sport of boys and girls , but a single woman , of good fortune , is always respectable , and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else .
_She_ was a little occupied in weighing her own feelings , and trying to understand the degree of her agitation , which she rather thought was considerable .
We seemed to understand each other .
That young man ( speaking lower ) is very thoughtless .
Small heart had Harriet for visiting .
Waiving that point , however , and supposing her to be , as you describe her , only pretty and good - natured , let me tell you , that in the degree she possesses them , they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general , for she is , in fact , a beautiful girl , and must be thought so by ninety - nine people out of an hundred ; and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed ; till they do fall in love with well - informed minds instead of handsome faces , a girl , with such loveliness as Harriet , has a certainty of being admired and sought after , of having the power of chusing from among many , consequently a claim to be nice .
How did you all behave ?
" Yes , she would be , but that she thinks there will be another put - off .
My mother desires her very best compliments and regards , and a thousand thanks , and says you really quite oppress her ."
When he came to Miss Woodhouse , he was obliged to read the whole of it aloud -- all that related to her , with a smile ; a look ; a shake of the head ; a word or two of assent , or disapprobation ; or merely of love , as the subject required ; concluding , however , seriously , and , after steady reflection , thus --
She had never rejoiced at the sound before , nor ever before entered the passage , nor walked up the stairs , with any wish of giving pleasure , but in conferring obligation , or of deriving it , except in subsequent ridicule .
" And what are we to do for a proper partner for her ?"
" I shall not scold you .
` Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself !'
He seemed to be almost asking her , whether her affections were engaged .-- But as soon as she ( Miss Woodhouse ) appeared likely to join them , he changed the subject , and began talking about farming :-- The second , was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour before Emma came back from her visit , the very last morning of his being at Hartfield -- though , when he first came in , he had said that he could not stay five minutes -- and his having told her , during their conversation , that though he must go to London , it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all , which was much more ( as Emma felt ) than he had acknowledged to _her_ .
Something occurred while they were at Hartfield , to make Emma want their advice ; and , which was still more lucky , she wanted exactly the advice they gave .
She never mentioned it before , because she would not alarm us .
But Mrs . Dixon must be very much disappointed .
madness , if it is so ; but I hope you are mistaken ."
She could not be alone without feeling the full weight of their separate claims ; and how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost , was the question .
-- Highbury , with Mrs . Weston , stood for Hartfield ; and she trusted to its bearing the same construction with him .
That was your doing , papa .
" While her dear father lived , any change of condition must be impossible for her .
Harriet did not consider herself as having any thing to complain of .
She did not really like her .
There is my sister ; and really quite her own little elegant figure !-- and the face not unlike .
A crowd in a little room -- Miss Woodhouse , you have the art of giving pictures in a few words .
