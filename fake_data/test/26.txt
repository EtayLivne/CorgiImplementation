He had been thinking it over most deeply , most intently ; he had at first hoped to induce Mr . Woodhouse to remove with her to Donwell ; he had wanted to believe it feasible , but his knowledge of Mr . Woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself long ; and now he confessed his persuasion , that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father ' s comfort , perhaps even of his life , which must not be hazarded .
I feel it so very due .
The dream must be borne with , and Mr . Knightley must take his seat with the rest round the large modern circular table which Emma had introduced at Hartfield , and which none but Emma could have had power to place there and persuade her father to use , instead of the small - sized Pembroke , on which two of his daily meals had , for forty years been crowded .
His manner had no air of study or exaggeration .
He came down by yesterday ' s coach , and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast , to report his proceedings , first on my affairs , and then on his own .
But take care of yourself .
Why does not he try Bath ?-- Indeed he should .
Every body last night said how well you played ."
cried Emma , " I know there is not a better creature in the world : but you must allow , that what is good and what is ridiculous are most unfortunately blended in her ."
She was in gay spirits , and would have prolonged the conversation , wanting to hear the particulars of his suspicions , every look described , and all the wheres and hows of a circumstance which highly entertained her : but his gaiety did not meet hers .
They all united ; and , on reaching Hartfield gates , Emma , who knew it was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father , pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him .
I am sure they will bring him soon ."
Frank Churchill came back again ; and if he kept his father ' s dinner waiting , it was not known at Hartfield ; for Mrs . Weston was too anxious for his being a favourite with Mr . Woodhouse , to betray any imperfection which could be concealed .
A fine open sea , he says , and very pure air .
She had taken up a wrong idea , fancying it was a mother and daughter , a son and son ' s wife , who all lived together ; but when it appeared that the Mr . Martin , who bore a part in the narrative , and was always mentioned with approbation for his great good - nature in doing something or other , was a single man ; that there was no young Mrs . Martin , no wife in the case ; she did suspect danger to her poor little friend from all this hospitality and kindness , and that , if she were not taken care of , she might be required to sink herself forever .
Her height was pretty , just such as almost every body would think tall , and nobody could think very tall ; her figure particularly graceful ; her size a most becoming medium , between fat and thin , though a slight appearance of ill - health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two .
Some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed , and others of the son and the uncle not letting him .
He might have doubled his presumption to me -- but poor Harriet !"
The only way of proving it , however , will be to turn to our maps .
But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge !
The preparations must take their time , nothing could be properly ready till the third week were entered on , and for a few days they must be planning , proceeding and hoping in uncertainty -- at the risk -- in her opinion , the great risk , of its being all in vain .
If we were obliged to go out such an evening as this , by any call of duty or business , what a hardship we should deem it ;-- and here are we , probably with rather thinner clothing than usual , setting forward voluntarily , without excuse , in defiance of the voice of nature , which tells man , in every thing given to his view or his feelings , to stay at home himself , and keep all under shelter that he can ;-- here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another man ' s house , with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard yesterday , and may not be said and heard again to - morrow .
He told me it was to be a great secret ; and , therefore , I should not think of mentioning it to any body but you , but he said you knew it ."
for I know gentlemen do not like morning visits , and Mr . Elton ' s time is so engaged ."
However , she seems a very obliging , pretty - behaved young lady , and no doubt will make him a very good wife .
I could not help being provoked ; for after all my pains , and when I had really made a very good likeness of it --( Mrs . Weston and I were quite agreed in thinking it _very_ like )-- only too handsome -- too flattering -- but that was a fault on the right side -- after all this , came poor dear Isabella ' s cold approbation of --" Yes , it was a little like -- but to be sure it did not do him justice ."
I remember one evening the poor boys saying , ` Uncle seems always tired now .'"
No , if he had believed me at all to share his feelings , he would not have been so wretched .
" My mother ' s deafness is very trifling you see -- just nothing at all .
It was , indeed , a highly prized letter .
Mr . Weston , with triumph of a different sort , was confessing that he had known it to be snowing some time , but had not said a word , lest it should make Mr . Woodhouse uncomfortable , and be an excuse for his hurrying away .
It is Frank Churchill ' s duty to pay this attention to his father .
So she thought at first ;-- but a little consideration convinced her that every thing need not be put off .
It does relate to him , and I will tell you directly ;" ( resuming her work , and seeming resolved against looking up .)
As long as they lived , no exertions would be necessary , their home might be hers for ever ; and for their own comfort they would have retained her wholly ; but this would be selfishness :-- what must be at last , had better be soon .
Either bathing has been of the greatest service to her , or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of Mr . Wingfield ' s , which we have been applying at times ever since August ."
Her friends evidently thought this good enough for her ; and it _was_ good enough .
Mr . Knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure ;-- not like Mr . Elton .
Mrs . Weston told me you were here .-- Oh !
cried Harriet , colouring , and astonished .
and " John , how are you ?"
Harriet had no penetration .
Here ,-- probably this basket with pink ribbon .
" Well , I believe , if you will excuse me , Mr . Knightley , if you will not consider me as doing a very rude thing , I shall take Emma ' s advice and go out for a quarter of an hour .
Would Jane but go , means were to be found , servants sent , friends contrived -- no travelling difficulty allowed to exist ; but still she had declined it !
" I hope she does .
This is all that I can relate of the how , where , and when .
shark is only one syllable .
Jane had come to Highbury professedly for three months ; the Campbells were gone to Ireland for three months ; but now the Campbells had promised their daughter to stay at least till Midsummer , and fresh invitations had arrived for her to join them there .
What a thinking brain you have !
It would amuse away the difficulties of her part , and lessen the irksomeness of Miss Smith ' s ."
Every thing tender and charming was to mark their parting ; but still they were to part .
The corner of the sofa is very good .
" Well , I have so little confidence in my own judgment , that whenever I marry , I hope some body will chuse my wife for me .
My Emma , does not every thing serve to prove more and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other ?"
His son , too well bred to hear the hint , rose immediately also , saying ,
I know him well .
It makes me envious and miserable ;-- I who have never seen it !
I mention no names ; but happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet !"
He may have as strong a sense of what would be right , as you can have , without being so equal , under particular circumstances , to act up to it ."
" Great has been the pleasure , I am sure .
such an aunt !"
Every body seemed happy ; and the praise of being a delightful ball , which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be , was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this .
" Ah !-- well -- to be sure .
Ah !
To youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma ' s , though under temporary gloom at night , the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of spirits .
Can I do any thing for you ?"
Take your own ."
Her person was rather good ; her face not unpretty ; but neither feature , nor air , nor voice , nor manner , were elegant .
Perhaps she ought to be ashamed , but Mr . Weston had been almost as uneasy as herself .-- In ten minutes , however , the child had been perfectly well again .
Elton ?"
Her face was averted from those who had made the attack , and turned towards her aunt .
she is a sweet creature !
Nothing , but to grow more worthy of him , whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own .
So very good of them to send her the whole way !
She is a woman that one may , that one _must_ laugh at ; but that one would not wish to slight .
But I think , my dear , you said you had got it ."
I would rather not be tempted .
She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful girl , which she trusted , with such frequent meetings at Hartfield , was foundation enough on his side ; and on Harriet ' s there could be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual weight and efficacy .
Emma was obliged to fancy what she liked -- but she could never believe that in the same situation _she_ should not have discovered the truth .
He is generally thought a fine young man , but do not expect a prodigy .
" That Mr . Elton should really be in love with me ,-- me , of all people , who did not know him , to speak to him , at Michaelmas !
She had not deserved it ; she had often been negligent or perverse , slighting his advice , or even wilfully opposing him , insensible of half his merits , and quarrelling with him because he would not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own -- but still , from family attachment and habit , and thorough excellence of mind , he had loved her , and watched over her from a girl , with an endeavour to improve her , and an anxiety for her doing right , which no other creature had at all shared .
" Very ."
-- but checking himself --" No , no , I understand you -- forgive me -- I am pleased that you can say even so much .-- He is no object of regret , indeed !
Many circumstances assisted the temptation .
She was particularly struck by his manner of considering Mr . Elton ' s house , which , as well as the church , he would go and look at , and would not join them in finding much fault with .
" Oh !
Elton ."
Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged -- appetite quite gone -- and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms , nothing touching the pulmonary complaint , which was the standing apprehension of the family , Mr . Perry was uneasy about her .
She had been often remiss , her conscience told her so ; remiss , perhaps , more in thought than fact ; scornful , ungracious .
A mind like hers , once opening to suspicion , made rapid progress .
" But really , I am half ashamed , and wish I had never taken up the idea ."
Understanding and gratification came together .
It does relate to him , and I will tell you directly ;" ( resuming her work , and seeming resolved against looking up .)
I consider one as including the other .
said she : " did you ever sit for your picture ?"
" A man ," said he , " must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks people to leave their own fireside , and encounter such a day as this , for the sake of coming to see him .
She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed : intelligent , well - informed , useful , gentle , knowing all the ways of the family , interested in all its concerns , and peculiarly interested in herself , in every pleasure , every scheme of hers -- one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose , and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault .
No !--( in an accent meant to be insinuating )-- I am sure you have seen and understood me ."
