Oh !
But she had believed them to be well - meaning , worthy people before ; and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion ?
Harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager exclamation .
" I say nothing of which I am ashamed ," replied he , with lively impudence .
She had hardly been able to speak a word , and every look and action had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness .
Emma had not been thinking of him , she had forgotten to think of him -- but she was very glad to see him .
It was not thrown away on her , she bounded higher than ever , flew farther down the middle , and was in a continual course of smiles .
He shook his head and laughed .--" I cannot separate Miss Fairfax and her complexion ."
" But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so soon , though he does .
" I am not fond of dinner - visiting ," said he --" I never was .
" Well ," said he , in a deliberating manner , " for five minutes , perhaps ."
So mild and ladylike -- and with such talents !-- I assure you I think she has very extraordinary talents .
" Yes ," said Harriet earnestly , " and well she might , nobody could ever have a better .
God knows , I have been a very indifferent lover .-- But you understand me .-- Yes , you see , you understand my feelings -- and will return them if you can .
" You would not have encouraged me , then , if you had understood me ?
With some there was great joy at the sight of Frank Churchill ; others took it very composedly ; but there was a very general distress and disturbance on Miss Fairfax ' s disappearance being explained .
I could very ill be spared -- but such a point had been made of my coming !
The contrivances of modern days indeed have rendered a gentleman ' s carriage perfectly complete .
" Indeed !
Her mind was in a state of flutter and wonder , which made it impossible for her to be collected .
Elton ?"
" She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there .
She had given them neither men , nor names , nor places , that could raise a blush .
It opens his designs to his family , it introduces you among them , it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature , eager curiosity and warm prepossession .
" Mrs . Cole has servants to send .
Elton ?"
She had never seen Frank Churchill so silent and stupid .
Here , she must be leading a life of privation and penance ; there it would have been all enjoyment .
We shall enjoy him completely ; every thing has turned out exactly as we could wish ."
Miss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence ; and finding that nothing more was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs . Cole ' s , turned to Frank Churchill .
But he is not the only gentleman you have been lately used to .
Her many beginnings were displayed .
Perry .-- I want his directions no more than his drugs ."
On his side were the inquiries ,--" Was she a horsewoman ?-- Pleasant rides ?-- Pleasant walks ?-- Had they a large neighbourhood ?-- Highbury , perhaps , afforded society enough ?-- There were several very pretty houses in and about it .-- Balls -- had they balls ?-- Was it a musical society ?"
Mr . Woodhouse talked over his alarms , and Emma was in spirits to persuade them away with all her usual promptitude .
It was her own choice to give the time of their absence to Highbury ; to spend , perhaps , her last months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear : and the Campbells , whatever might be their motive or motives , whether single , or double , or treble , gave the arrangement their ready sanction , and said , that they depended more on a few months spent in her native air , for the recovery of her health , than on any thing else .
" Are you sure ?
Living constantly with right - minded and well - informed people , her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline and culture ; and Colonel Campbell ' s residence being in London , every lighter talent had been done full justice to , by the attendance of first - rate masters .
at present I ask no more ."
If any thing , you are too attentive .
Vanity , extravagance , love of change , restlessness of temper , which must be doing something , good or bad ; heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs . Weston , indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general ; he became liable to all these charges .
They were going to remove immediately to Richmond .
His gallantry was always on the alert .
madam ," cried Emma , " if other children are at all like what I remember to have been myself , I should think five times the amount of what I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions , dearly earned ."
It had been a very happy fortnight , and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common course of Hartfield days .
To guess what all this meant , was impossible even for Emma .
" No , I do not know that Mr . Wingfield considers it _very_ sickly except --
She would not take a denial .
This proves that he can leave the Churchills ."
If we feel for the wretched , enough to do all we can for them , the rest is empty sympathy , only distressing to ourselves ."
" You mean to return a favourable answer , I collect ."
" You understand the force of influence pretty well , Harriet ; but I would have you so firmly established in good society , as to be independent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse .
The quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for Mr . Woodhouse , who had often been distressed by the more animated sort , which Mr . Weston had occasionally introduced , and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting , with tender melancholy , over the departure of the " poor little boys ," or in fondly pointing out , as he took up any stray letter near him , how beautifully Emma had written it .
In spite of all her faults , she knew she was dear to him ; might she not say , very dear ?-- When the suggestions of hope , however , which must follow here , presented themselves , she could not presume to indulge them .
What happiness it must be to her good old grandmother and excellent aunt , when she comes to visit them !
He is just as superior as ever ;-- but being married , you know , it is quite a different thing .
" How I could so long a time be fancying myself !
" How do you do , Mrs . Ford ?
I shall , therefore , set off to - morrow .'
" He had better not be in a hurry .
Humph -- Harriet ' s ready wit !
" How is it possible ?"
How , where , when ?-- Let me know it all .
He seemed hardly to hear her ; he was thoughtful -- and in a manner which shewed him not pleased , soon afterwards said ,
He wished the road might be impassable , that he might be able to keep them all at Randalls ; and with the utmost good - will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body , calling on his wife to agree with him , that with a little contrivance , every body might be lodged , which she hardly knew how to do , from the consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house .
" I wonder what they are all doing -- whether his sisters know -- if he is unhappy , they will be unhappy too .
He was afraid not even Miss Woodhouse "-- he stopt a moment --" or Miss Smith could inspire him ."
If we feel for the wretched , enough to do all we can for them , the rest is empty sympathy , only distressing to ourselves ."
He was warm in his reprobation of Mr . Elton ' s conduct ; it had been unpardonable rudeness ; and Mrs . Elton ' s looks also received the due share of censure .
Upon the whole , she was very persuadable ; and it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting his comfort -- how certainly Mrs . Goddard , if not Mrs . Bates , might be depended on for bearing him company -- Mr . Woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his daughter ' s going out to dinner on a day now near at hand , and spending the whole evening away from him .
" What is the matter ?"
.
She could not be alone without feeling the full weight of their separate claims ; and how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost , was the question .
The idea of her being indebted to Mrs . Elton for what was called an _introduction_ -- of her going into public under the auspices of a friend of Mrs . Elton ' s -- probably some vulgar , dashing widow , who , with the help of a boarder , just made a shift to live !-- The dignity of Miss Woodhouse , of Hartfield , was sunk indeed !
Mr . John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure , but said only , coolly ,
" But , in spite of all her friends ' urgency , and her own wish of seeing Ireland , Miss Fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and Mrs .
" Ah !
She hardly knew what to say .
what do you mean ?-- Mistake you !-- Am I to suppose then ?--"
You must see the difference ."
His appearance was very neat , and he looked like a sensible young man , but his person had no other advantage ; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen , she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet ' s inclination .
I assure you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in private life ."
CHAPTER XII
She had a great idea that people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the extensive grounds of any body else ; but it was not worth while to attack an error so double - dyed , and therefore only said in reply ,
And besides the operation of this , as a general principle , you may be sure that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs . Elton by her superiority both of mind and manner ; and that , face to face , Mrs . Elton treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to .
" This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements , sir .
That , from such a quarter , one might expect .
" Ah !
I have done with match - making indeed .
He turned to Mrs . Weston to implore her assistance , " Would not she give him her support ?-- would not she add her persuasions to his , to induce Miss Woodhouse not to go to Mrs . Goddard ' s till it were certain that Miss Smith ' s disorder had no infection ?
" As you do us such ample justice now ," said Emma , laughing , " I will venture to ask , whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first ?
I do not think it could disagree with you ."
He will be a completely gross , vulgar farmer , totally inattentive to appearances , and thinking of nothing but profit and loss ."
Every thing that I have said or done , for many weeks past , has been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself .
Both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again ; and after a few minutes silence , he said ,
I do indeed .
Frank comes to - morrow -- I had a letter this morning -- we see him to - morrow by dinner - time to a certainty -- he is at Oxford to - day , and he comes for a whole fortnight ; I knew it would be so .
His appearance was very neat , and he looked like a sensible young man , but his person had no other advantage ; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen , she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet ' s inclination .
" He knew nothing about it , Emma .
She would have ordered the carriage , and come to you , but she must see you _alone_ , and that you know --( nodding towards her father )-- Humph !-- Can you come ?"
