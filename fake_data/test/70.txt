" Such an extraordinary dream of mine !"
How to understand the deceptions she had been thus practising on herself , and living under !-- The blunders , the blindness of her own head and heart !-- she sat still , she walked about , she tried her own room , she tried the shrubbery -- in every place , every posture , she perceived that she had acted most weakly ; that she had been imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree ; that she had been imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying ; that she was wretched , and should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness .
I remember one evening the poor boys saying , ` Uncle seems always tired now .'"
A mind like hers , once opening to suspicion , made rapid progress .
-- Those were Miss Woodhouse ' s words , were they ?-- And a fine ending -- and there is the letter .
" Well , I have so little confidence in my own judgment , that whenever I marry , I hope some body will chuse my wife for me .
Her mind returned to Mrs . Elton ' s offences , and long , very long , did they occupy her .
" It is certainly very well regulated ."
The fact is , I suppose , that she is tired of Enscombe .
Ford .-- " Yes -- no -- yes , to Mrs . Goddard ' s .
" Well , Miss Woodhouse !"
If we were obliged to go out such an evening as this , by any call of duty or business , what a hardship we should deem it ;-- and here are we , probably with rather thinner clothing than usual , setting forward voluntarily , without excuse , in defiance of the voice of nature , which tells man , in every thing given to his view or his feelings , to stay at home himself , and keep all under shelter that he can ;-- here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another man ' s house , with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard yesterday , and may not be said and heard again to - morrow .
" Dear Emma bears every thing so well ," said her father .
" He has been used to her in these complaints , and I hope to - morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report .
We never see any thing of it on our club - nights ."
She was most forcibly struck .
Presently the carriage stopt ; she looked up ; it was stopt by Mr . and Mrs . Weston , who were standing to speak to her .
He would feel himself in the right ; and the declaration -- made , of course , as a man of sense would make it , in a proper manner -- would do him more good , raise him higher , fix his interest stronger with the people he depended on , than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do .
" Well , my dear ," he deliberately began , " considering we never saw her before , she seems a very pretty sort of young lady ; and I dare say she was very much pleased with you .
They are very fond of being at Hartfield , Harriet ."
I do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us , Harriet , by additional softness , but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be .
" There is nothing to be compared to it .
Disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn .
" Mrs . Elton , I suppose , has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax owes --"
They hardly can satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings : standing in a mother ' s place , but without a mother ' s affection to blind her .
" Has your son been with you , then ?"
I hope not of a putrid infectious sort .
She was sitting by Mr . Knightley , and turned to him for help .
" Jane Fairfax has feeling ," said Mr . Knightley --" I do not accuse her of want of feeling .
As far as good intentions went , we were _both_ right , and I must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong .
He was on the move immediately ; but coming back , said ,
Emma seriously hoped she would .
He would feel himself in the right ; and the declaration -- made , of course , as a man of sense would make it , in a proper manner -- would do him more good , raise him higher , fix his interest stronger with the people he depended on , than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do .
They were so deserving , that a _little_ higher should have been enough : but as it was , how could she have done otherwise ?-- Impossible !-- She could not repent .
no -- none in the least .
Am I to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss Smith ?-- that you have never thought seriously of her ?"
I wish Jane Fairfax very well ; but she tires me to death ."
His admiration was certainly very warm ; yet she thought , but for Mrs . Weston , it would not have struck her .
I am very happy .
And if he were to be lost to them for Harriet ' s sake ; if he were to be thought of hereafter , as finding in Harriet ' s society all that he wanted ; if Harriet were to be the chosen , the first , the dearest , the friend , the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence ; what could be increasing Emma ' s wretchedness but the reflection never far distant from her mind , that it had been all her own work ?
The symptoms were favourable .-- Instead of answering , Harriet turned away confused , and stood thoughtfully by the fire ; and though the letter was still in her hand , it was now mechanically twisted about without regard .
She was not so materially cast down , however , but that a little time and the return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives .
I only wanted to prove to you that Mrs . S . admits our apology , and is not offended .
But it is impossible not to feel uneasiness .
-- And to this day , I do believe , she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter ' s ."
Now , here will be Mr . Elton and Miss Hawkins ; and there are the Coles , such very good people ; and the Perrys -- I suppose there never was a happier or a better couple than Mr . and Mrs . Perry .
It was not in his calmness that she read his comparative difference .
His good - nature , his humanity , as I tell you , would be quite enough to account for the horses .
" Well , there _is_ feeling here .-- He does seem to have suffered in finding her ill .-- Certainly , I can have no doubt of his being fond of her .
They sang together once more ; and Emma would then resign her place to Miss Fairfax , whose performance , both vocal and instrumental , she never could attempt to conceal from herself , was infinitely superior to her own .
She would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place in her mind which Harriet had occupied .
" I have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man .
It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his schemes ; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth , it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase Randalls , and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to ; but he had gone steadily on , with these objects in view , till they were accomplished .
Mr . John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother .
Emma seriously hoped she would .
" What a very great pleasure it will be to you !
The day came , the party were punctually assembled , and Mr . John Knightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable .
But as she wanted to be drawing , the declaration must wait a little longer .
Could a linguist , could a grammarian , could even a mathematician have seen what she did , have witnessed their appearance together , and heard their history of it , without feeling that circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other ?-- How much more must an imaginist , like herself , be on fire with speculation and foresight !-- especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her mind had already made .
But hush , hush !"
Miss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door ; and her visitors walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to , pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good - will .
If you think he will come , I shall think so too ; for you know Enscombe ."
They can do nothing satisfactorily without you ."
They seemed more like cheerful , easy friends , than lovers .
Emma listened with the warmest concern ; grieved for her more and more , and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful .
I am sure they will like her extremely ; and when she gets a little acquainted with them , her fears will completely wear off , for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliating .-- I shall have her very often indeed while they are with me , and I dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in the barouche - landau in some of our exploring parties ."
She remembered what Mr . Knightley had once said to her about Mr . Elton , the caution he had given , the conviction he had professed that Mr . Elton would never marry indiscreetly ; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself .
" They told me -- that Mr . Martin dined with them last Saturday ."
In short , I can feel no dependence on his coming , and I wish Mr . Weston were less sanguine ."
It would only be giving trouble and distress .
One cannot love a reserved person ."
There does seem to be a something in the air of Hartfield which gives love exactly the right direction , and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow .
I never saw such a likeness in my life .
" You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs . and Miss Bates ," said Emma , " I have not heard one inquiry after them ."
I beg your pardon .
But from one cause or another , I gave it up in disgust .
You know , my dear , she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor was to us .
-- which my mother , being on the watch , heard distinctly , and was sadly alarmed at .
" The carriage !
The very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten !-- My dear Mr . E ., he must have left a message for you , I am sure he must .-- Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric ;-- and his servants forgot it .
do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax ' s sensations from you , or from any body else .
Bates ?"
She opened the packet ; it was too surely so ;-- a note from Mrs . Weston to herself , ushered in the letter from Frank to Mrs . Weston .
" I say nothing of which I am ashamed ," replied he , with lively impudence .
She tried to stop him ; but vainly ; he would go on , and say it all .
It was all right , all open , all equal .
It is a great deal more natural than one could wish , that a young man , brought up by those who are proud , luxurious , and selfish , should be proud , luxurious , and selfish too .
I was snowed up at a friend ' s house once for a week .
She had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother , but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother ' s unreasonable anger , nor from missing the luxuries of her former home .
Mr . Weston meanwhile , perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was exciting , happy and cheerful as usual , and with all the right of being principal talker , which a day spent anywhere from home confers , was making himself agreeable among the rest ; and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner , convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants had been forgotten , and spread abroad what public news he had heard , was proceeding to a family communication , which , though principally addressed to Mrs . Weston , he had not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in the room .
" The Churchills are very likely in fault ," said Mr . Knightley , coolly ; " but I dare say he might come if he would ."
" Is not she looking well ?"
You find me trying to be useful ; tell me if you think I shall succeed ."
Emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little self - willed , and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of dancing with her ; but she took the compliment , and forgave the rest .
I do not advise you to give way to it , Harriet .
no , my love ; but you will soon be tired .
As he became rational , he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in their authority .
" Well , my dear ," he deliberately began , " considering we never saw her before , she seems a very pretty sort of young lady ; and I dare say she was very much pleased with you .
But you are too good for that , I am sure ."
It was a dislike so little just -- every imputed fault was so magnified by fancy , that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any considerable absence , without feeling that she had injured her ; and now , when the due visit was paid , on her arrival , after a two years ' interval , she was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners , which for those two whole years she had been depreciating .
