" I have something to tell you , Emma ; some news ."
" Mr . Elton , this is the most extraordinary conduct !
He was silent .
I would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else ; but you need not be afraid , they are very small , you see -- one of our small eggs will not hurt you .
" I hope every body had a pleasant evening ," said Mr . Woodhouse , in his quiet way .
In fact , it does not concern you -- it concerns only myself ,-- that is , we hope .-- Humph !-- In short , my dear Emma , there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it .
No !--( in an accent meant to be insinuating )-- I am sure you have seen and understood me ."
You will laugh at my warmth -- but , upon my word , I talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax .-- And her situation is so calculated to affect one !-- Miss Woodhouse , we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her .
Many circumstances assisted the temptation .
Had she followed Mr . Knightley ' s known wishes , in paying that attention to Miss Fairfax , which was every way her due ; had she tried to know her better ; had she done her part towards intimacy ; had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith ; she must , in all probability , have been spared from every pain which pressed on her now .-- Birth , abilities , and education , had been equally marking one as an associate for her , to be received with gratitude ; and the other -- what was she ?-- Supposing even that they had never become intimate friends ; that she had never been admitted into Miss Fairfax ' s confidence on this important matter -- which was most probable -- still , in knowing her as she ought , and as she might , she must have been preserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr . Dixon , which she had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself , but had so unpardonably imparted ; an idea which she greatly feared had been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane ' s feelings , by the levity or carelessness of Frank Churchill ' s .
" No , to be sure you could not ; but I never thought of that before .
Only three of us .-- besides dear Jane at present -- and she really eats nothing -- makes such a shocking breakfast , you would be quite frightened if you saw it .
she cried , satisfied to have no one preferred to herself .--" You are a humourist , and may say what you like .
" You are speaking of letters of business ; mine are letters of friendship ."
Mr . Woodhouse would have been miserable had his daughter attempted it , and she was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas .
There is no danger of your not being intelligible , which is the first thing .
I am sure they will like her extremely ; and when she gets a little acquainted with them , her fears will completely wear off , for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliating .-- I shall have her very often indeed while they are with me , and I dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in the barouche - landau in some of our exploring parties ."
" Elegant , agreeable manners , I was prepared for ," said he ; " but I confess that , considering every thing , I had not expected more than a very tolerably well - looking woman of a certain age ; I did not know that I was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs .
dear , Miss Woodhouse -- well , at last , I fancy , he looked round and saw me ; for instead of going on with her buyings , they began whispering to one another .
" No -- I cannot call them gifts ; but they are things that I have valued very much ."
cried Emma , shaking her head .--" Ah !
I am not prejudiced ."
.
Emma was not thinking of it at the moment , which made the information she received more valuable .
But here there was nothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future .
I may not have convinced you perhaps , but I am perfectly convinced myself that Mr . Dixon is a principal in the business ."
Mr . and Mrs . John Knightley , from having been longer than usual absent from Surry , were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest .
Mr . Elton , I must beg leave to stop at your house , and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string , or any thing just to keep my boot on ."
This is feeling your way .
And , indeed , though my mother ' s eyes are not so good as they were , she can see amazingly well still , thank God !
said Frank Churchill .
you are not serious now .
Mrs . Weston ought to have found more in it , for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him ; but though she had one sort of spirit , she had not the best .
Emma had not had time even to think of Mr . Elton , and she was so completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start , and a little blush , at the sound .
Angry as she was , the thought of the moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak .
She promised , however , to think of it ; and pretty nearly promised , moreover , to think of it , with the intention of finding it a very good scheme .
I know no man more likely than Mr . Knightley to do the sort of thing -- to do any thing really good - natured , useful , considerate , or benevolent .
"' Tis twelve ; I shall not forget to think of you four hours hence ; and by this time to - morrow , perhaps , or a little later , I may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here .
" There is no denying it ," he replied .
She knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than she could perform with credit ; she wanted neither taste nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable , and could accompany her own voice well .
" Very well -- and as Randalls , I suppose , is not likely to have less influence than heretofore , it strikes me as a possible thing , Emma , that Henry and John may be sometimes in the way .
Harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful .
I have a right to talk on such subjects , without being suspected of introducing Robert Martin ."
" You will not ask me what is the point of envy .-- You are determined , I see , to have no curiosity .-- You are wise -- but _I_ cannot be wise .
" I have always admired her complexion ," replied Emma , archly ; " but do not I remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale ?-- When we first began to talk of her .-- Have you quite forgotten ?"
" I have known her from a child , undoubtedly ; we have been children and women together ; and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate ,-- that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited her friends .
You will see her to advantage ; see her and hear her -- no , I am afraid you will not hear her at all , for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue ."
I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I had been of some use ; but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they may .
Every body must be aware that Miss Taylor must be missed , but every body ought also to be assured that Mr . and Mrs . Weston do really prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated -- which is the exact truth ."
Of all houses in the kingdom Mrs . Bragge ' s is the one I would most wish to see you in ."
Perhaps it is paid already .
for I know gentlemen do not like morning visits , and Mr . Elton ' s time is so engaged ."
I am always glad to see him .
" True , true ," he answered , warmly .
" Well !
cried Emma , not attending to her .--" Mrs .
` Woman , lovely woman .'
" I should have been sorry , Mr . Knightley , to be dependent on _your_ recommendation , had I quitted Mr . Woodhouse ' s family and wanted another situation ; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body .
Mr . Knightley does nothing mysteriously ."
However , she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago ; which is saying a great deal at my mother ' s time of life -- and it really is full two years , you know , since she was here .
The pleasure is not enhanced , and the inconvenience is often considerable .
It does relate to him , and I will tell you directly ;" ( resuming her work , and seeming resolved against looking up .)
Miss Bates looked about her , so happily !--
His company so sought after , that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it ; that he has more invitations than there are days in the week .
The symptoms were favourable .-- Instead of answering , Harriet turned away confused , and stood thoughtfully by the fire ; and though the letter was still in her hand , it was now mechanically twisted about without regard .
He is an excellent young man , both as son and brother .
The " How d ' ye do ' s " were quiet and constrained on each side .
Most comfortable carriage .-- Oh !
She was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all apprehensive or embarrassed ; it was for him .
and I can account for it only in one way ; you are not yourself , or you could not speak either to me , or of Harriet , in such a manner .
Oh !
.
After the first chat of pleasure he was silent ; and then , in a graver tone , began with ,
" Mrs . Cole has servants to send .
" I do not say it is so ; but you will do well to consider whether it is so or not , and to regulate your behaviour accordingly .
" Oh !
Weston .-- " Very well , I thank you , ma ' am .
" Yes -- I _have_ called there ; passing the door , I thought it better .
" No trouble in the world , ma ' am ," said the obliging Mrs . Ford .
He was wishing to confide in her -- perhaps to consult her ;-- cost her what it would , she would listen .
She was stopped by a slight fit of coughing , and Mr . Weston instantly seized the opportunity of going on .
As Harriet described it , there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour .
" He will have every body ' s wishes for his happiness ."
There she sat -- and who would have guessed how many tears she had been lately shedding ?
What is to become of that ?-- Very true .
Let every body on the Hill hear me if they can .
There was no recovering Miss Taylor -- nor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her ; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr . Woodhouse .
" A man ," said he , " must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks people to leave their own fireside , and encounter such a day as this , for the sake of coming to see him .
The invitation was everywhere so well received , that it seemed as if , like Mrs . Elton , they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to themselves .-- Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it ; and Mr . Weston , unasked , promised to get Frank over to join them , if possible ; a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with .-- Mr . Knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad to see him ; and Mr . Weston engaged to lose no time in writing , and spare no arguments to induce him to come .
He did so , but very soon stopt again to say , " the pianoforte !
I shall not attempt calling on Mrs . Goddard , for I really do not think she cares for any thing but _boiled_ pork : when we dress the leg it will be another thing .
Emma and Harriet were going to walk ; he joined them ; and , on returning , they fell in with a larger party , who , like themselves , judged it wisest to take their exercise early , as the weather threatened rain ; Mr . and Mrs . Weston and their son , Miss Bates and her niece , who had accidentally met .
` If you must go , my dear ,' said I , ` you must , and I will say you are laid down upon the bed .'"
Here , she must be leading a life of privation and penance ; there it would have been all enjoyment .
Not that I think Mr . Martin would ever marry any body but what had had some education -- and been very well brought up .
she was considerably worse from this reappearance of Mr . Elton .
The wedding was no distant event , as the parties had only themselves to please , and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for ; and when he set out for Bath again , there was a general expectation , which a certain glance of Mrs . Cole ' s did not seem to contradict , that when he next entered Highbury he would bring his bride .
" Mr . Weston do not trifle with me .-- Consider how many of my dearest friends are now in Brunswick Square .
Well , I was persuaded there were two .
I should not mind walking half the way .
