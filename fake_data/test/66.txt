A warm climate may be prescribed for her .
cried Mr . Elton , " what can be the meaning of this ?-- Miss Smith !-- I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my existence -- never paid her any attentions , but as your friend : never cared whether she were dead or alive , but as your friend .
All the minor arrangements of table and chair , lights and music , tea and supper , made themselves ; or were left as mere trifles to be settled at any time between Mrs . Weston and Mrs .
" Oh !
His wish of staying longer evidently did not please ; but it was not opposed .
This is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating .
" Oh !
Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet ' s fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose , for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr . Elton ' s being a remarkably handsome man , with most agreeable manners ; and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints , she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on Harriet ' s side , as there could be any occasion for .
sir -- but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a window - curtain , and throw up a sash , without its being suspected .
He was very much pleased with Randalls , thought it a most admirably arranged house , would hardly allow it even to be very small , admired the situation , the walk to Highbury , Highbury itself , Hartfield still more , and professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but one ' s _own_ country gives , and the greatest curiosity to visit it .
" Indeed you did .
if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax !"
Harriet submitted , though her mind could hardly separate the parts , so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a declaration of love .
So afraid you might have a headache !-- seeing you pass by so often , and knowing how much trouble you must have .
But I must be more in want of a friend , or an agreeable companion , than I have yet been , to take the trouble of conquering any body ' s reserve to procure one .
I do not pretend to be a wit .
The scene enlarged ; two persons appeared ; Mrs . Weston and her son - in - law ; they were walking into Highbury ;-- to Hartfield of course .
I have heard him say that he could listen to her for ever .
" You get upon delicate subjects , Emma ," said Mrs . Weston smiling ; " remember that I am here .-- Mr .
" Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately ?
My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the table spread in the dining - room .
such delightful proofs of Hartfield ' s attraction , as those sort of visits conveyed , might shortly be over .
They would be married , and settled either at or near Enscombe .
Man ' s boasted power and freedom , all are flown ; Lord of the earth and sea , he bends a slave , And woman , lovely woman , reigns alone .
A boyish scheme , indeed !-- I cannot comprehend a man ' s wishing to give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense with ; and he did know that she would have prevented the instrument ' s coming if she could ."
Emma turned round to look at her in consternation , and hastily said ,
" Oh !
You would not think it to look at him , but he is bilious -- Mr . Cole is very bilious .
Making - up indeed would not do .
Surprizes are foolish things .
" I should have been sorry , Mr . Knightley , to be dependent on _your_ recommendation , had I quitted Mr . Woodhouse ' s family and wanted another situation ; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body .
when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of court - plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about !
" Oh !
" Oh !
" Oh , the difference of situation and habit !
While waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off , Emma found time , in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her voice and her taste , to look about , and see what became of Mr . Knightley .
He seemed hardly to hear her ; he was thoughtful -- and in a manner which shewed him not pleased , soon afterwards said ,
If I find him conversable , I shall be glad of his acquaintance ; but if he is only a chattering coxcomb , he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts ."
Emma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her friend .
" And you must be off this very morning ?"
" No -- It will not be worth while .
" It is hotter to - day ."
All this ran so glibly through her thoughts , that by the time her father had arranged himself , after the bustle of the Eltons ' departure , and was ready to speak , she was very tolerably capable of attending .
said he quietly , and looking at her ; " of what nature ?"
She must have been a perpetual enemy .
" Poor creatures !
We cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before .
" Not at all , sir .
" Where is the young man ?"
He must have a pretty good opinion of himself ."
That is , _I_ always had a strong persuasion he would be here again soon , I was sure something favourable would turn up -- but nobody believed me .
How little did I think !-- The two Abbots and I ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by , and Miss Nash came and scolded us away , and staid to look through herself ; however , she called me back presently , and let me look too , which was very good - natured .
No !-- she was more and more convinced that Mrs . Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise .
How was she to bear the change ?-- It was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them ; but Emma was aware that great must be the difference between a Mrs . Weston , only half a mile from them , and a Miss Taylor in the house ; and with all her advantages , natural and domestic , she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude .
I wish you could have heard how she talked of it -- with what candour and generosity .
He was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern .
Where shall we see a better daughter , or a kinder sister , or a truer friend ?
Here are seven of you , besides myself , ( who , she is pleased to say , am very entertaining already ,) and she only demands from each of you either one thing very clever , be it prose or verse , original or repeated -- or two things moderately clever -- or three things very dull indeed , and she engages to laugh heartily at them all ."
Emma could hardly understand him ; he seemed in an odd humour .
It opens his designs to his family , it introduces you among them , it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature , eager curiosity and warm prepossession .
Mr . Martin , I imagine , has his fortune entirely to make -- cannot be at all beforehand with the world .
" I wonder he did not remember the book "-- was all Harriet ' s answer , and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be safely left to itself .
" Very nicely dressed , indeed ; a remarkably elegant gown ."
" My dear , you do not understand me .
He could not be satisfied without a promise -- would not she give him her influence in procuring it ?"
It has been completely unexpected .
There is no danger of your not being intelligible , which is the first thing .
Elton ?"
Another room of much better size might be secured for the purpose ; but it was at the other end of the house , and a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it .
" We are going to Box Hill to - morrow ;-- you will join us .
We feel things differently .
no -- none in the least .
dear -- I think you play the best of the two .
said she .--" To chuse to remain here month after month , under privations of every sort !
" But where could _you_ hear it ?"
Such another scheme , composed of so many ill - assorted people , she hoped never to be betrayed into again .
I am quite ready .
Are you in any doubt as to that ?
Emma seriously hoped she would .
I want you to save yourself from greater pain .
I am tired of doing nothing .
However , when I read on , I found it was not near so bad as I had fancied at first ; and I make so light of it now to her , that she does not think much about it .
They are not far off .
" My poor dear Isabella ," said he , fondly taking her hand , and interrupting , for a few moments , her busy labours for some one of her five children --" How long it is , how terribly long since you were here !
-- Those were the words ; in them lay the tormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of , and which constituted the real misery of the business to her .
Mr . Elton ' s engagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting Mr . Martin .
She inherits her mother ' s talents , and must have been under subjection to her ."
But now , she would rather it had not happened .
He was not calm ; his spirits were evidently fluttered ; there was restlessness about him .
They sat down to tea -- the same party round the same table -- how often it had been collected !-- and how often had her eyes fallen on the same shrubs in the lawn , and observed the same beautiful effect of the western sun !-- But never in such a state of spirits , never in any thing like it ; and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house , or even the attentive daughter .
In this state of suspense they were befriended , not by any sudden illumination of Mr . Woodhouse ' s mind , or any wonderful change of his nervous system , but by the operation of the same system in another way .-- Mrs . Weston ' s poultry - house was robbed one night of all her turkeys -- evidently by the ingenuity of man .
Yes , Harriet , just so long have I been wanting the very circumstance to happen what has happened .
There will not be time for any thing ."
she is a sweet creature !
Ah !
Go , and interfere .
CHAPTER XII
I treat you without ceremony , Mr . Knightley .
If he had been anxious for secrecy , he would not have left the paper while I was by ; but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you .
But though I was always doing wrong things , they were very bad wrong things , and such as did me no service .-- It would have been a much better transgression had I broken the bond of secrecy and told you every thing ."
