Call upon her , by all means ."
I condition for nothing else ; but without music , life would be a blank to me .'"
Papa is only speaking his own regret ."
Not a creature knowing it but themselves -- neither the Campbells , nor her family , nor his .-- It is so wonderful , that though perfectly convinced of the fact , it is yet almost incredible to myself .
" So scrupulous for others ," he continued , " and yet so careless for herself !
It is not likely you should ever have observed him ; but he knows you very well indeed -- I mean by sight ."
" This is very true ," said she , " at least as far as relates to me , which was all that was meant -- and it is very shameful .-- Of the same age -- and always knowing her -- I ought to have been more her friend .-- She will never like me now .
She need not trouble herself to pity him .
Such talent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknown .-- I dare say you have heard those charming lines of the poet ,
She appeared to me to play well , that is , with considerable taste , but I know nothing of the matter myself .-- I am excessively fond of music , but without the smallest skill or right of judging of any body ' s performance .-- I have been used to hear her ' s admired ; and I remember one proof of her being thought to play well :-- a man , a very musical man , and in love with another woman -- engaged to her -- on the point of marriage -- would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument , if the lady in question could sit down instead -- never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other .
I am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head .
Emma even jumped with surprize ;-- and , horror - struck , exclaimed ,
The ground covered with snow , and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw , which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise , every morning beginning in rain or snow , and every evening setting in to freeze , she was for many days a most honourable prisoner .
A letter arrived from Mr . Churchill to urge his nephew ' s instant return .
" Oh !
You must take care of yourself , Mrs .
He seemed to be almost asking her , whether her affections were engaged .-- But as soon as she ( Miss Woodhouse ) appeared likely to join them , he changed the subject , and began talking about farming :-- The second , was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour before Emma came back from her visit , the very last morning of his being at Hartfield -- though , when he first came in , he had said that he could not stay five minutes -- and his having told her , during their conversation , that though he must go to London , it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all , which was much more ( as Emma felt ) than he had acknowledged to _her_ .
She has now been a longer time stationary there , than she ever was before , and she begins to want change .
He looked rather doubtingly -- rather confused ; said something about " honour ,"-- glanced at Emma and at Harriet , and then seeing the book open on the table , took it up , and examined it very attentively .
She pondered , but could think of nothing .
" Pray , Mr . Knightley ," said Emma , who had been smiling to herself through a great part of this speech , " how do you know that Mr . Martin did not speak yesterday ?"
These were pleasant feelings , and she walked about and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did , and collect round the strawberry - beds .-- The whole party were assembled , excepting Frank Churchill , who was expected every moment from Richmond ; and Mrs . Elton , in all her apparatus of happiness , her large bonnet and her basket , was very ready to lead the way in gathering , accepting , or talking -- strawberries , and only strawberries , could now be thought or spoken of .--" The best fruit in England -- every body ' s favourite -- always wholesome .-- These the finest beds and finest sorts .-- Delightful to gather for one ' s self -- the only way of really enjoying them .-- Morning decidedly the best time -- never tired -- every sort good -- hautboy infinitely superior -- no comparison -- the others hardly eatable -- hautboys very scarce -- Chili preferred -- white wood finest flavour of all -- price of strawberries in London -- abundance about Bristol -- Maple Grove -- cultivation -- beds when to be renewed -- gardeners thinking exactly different -- no general rule -- gardeners never to be put out of their way -- delicious fruit -- only too rich to be eaten much of -- inferior to cherries -- currants more refreshing -- only objection to gathering strawberries the stooping -- glaring sun -- tired to death -- could bear it no longer -- must go and sit in the shade ."
Alas !
he could ride to London at any time .
How improperly had she been acting by Harriet !
You will know it all in time .
" And now that I understand your question , I must pronounce it to be a very unfair one .
His eldest daughter ' s alarm was equal to his own .
" If it were admissible to contradict a lady ," said the gallant Mr . Elton --
" Ah !
" Harriet , I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning .
" Not I , indeed .
My liveliness and your solidity would produce perfection .-- Not that I presume to insinuate , however , that _some_ people may not think _you_ perfection already .-- But hush !-- not a word , if you please ."
" Miss Fairfax was not well enough to write ;" and when Mr . Perry called at Hartfield , the same morning , it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited , though against her own consent , by himself , and that she was suffering under severe headaches , and a nervous fever to a degree , which made him doubt the possibility of her going to Mrs . Smallridge ' s at the time proposed .
" I never should have presumed to think of it at first ," said she , " but for you .
The case , you see , is --( but this is quite between ourselves : I did not mention a syllable of it in the other room .
The corner of the sofa is very good .
I thought you had lost half your property , at least .
He had left them completely frightened ; and Harriet eagerly clinging to him , and hardly able to speak , had just strength enough to reach Hartfield , before her spirits were quite overcome .
You would not have been so long in coming , if you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury ."
The invitation was everywhere so well received , that it seemed as if , like Mrs . Elton , they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to themselves .-- Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it ; and Mr . Weston , unasked , promised to get Frank over to join them , if possible ; a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with .-- Mr . Knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad to see him ; and Mr . Weston engaged to lose no time in writing , and spare no arguments to induce him to come .
Though now the middle of December , there had yet been no weather to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise ; and on the morrow , Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family , who lived a little way out of Highbury .
But here there was nothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future .
With regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland , her account to her aunt contained nothing but truth , though there might be some truths not told .
They are not at all the less written you know , because you divide them .
We will not be parted .
Emma then looked up , and immediately saw how it was ; and after a moment ' s debate , as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not , replied ,
said Mr . Woodhouse , shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her with tender concern .-- The ejaculation in Emma ' s ear expressed , " Ah !
" Indifferent !
The answer was only in this short note :
A walk before breakfast does me good ."
At Hartfield , you have had very good specimens of well educated , well bred men .
" You have some news to hear , now you are come back , that will rather surprize you ."
" Yes -- it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill - humour of Mrs . Churchill , which I imagine to be the most certain thing in the world ."
Perfect happiness , even in memory , is not common ; and there were two points on which she was not quite easy .
She came solitarily down the gravel walk -- a Miss Martin just appearing at the door , and parting with her seemingly with ceremonious civility .
When once it had been read , there was no doing any thing , but lament and exclaim .
I do not pretend to be a wit .
" How do you do , Mrs . Ford ?
I am quite enough in love .
I hoped I was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description .
I am in no hurry .
and I have often wished -- but it is so little one can venture to do -- small , trifling presents , of any thing uncommon -- Now we have killed a porker , and Emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg ; it is very small and delicate -- Hartfield pork is not like any other pork -- but still it is pork -- and , my dear Emma , unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks , nicely fried , as ours are fried , without the smallest grease , and not roast it , for no stomach can bear roast pork -- I think we had better send the leg -- do not you think so , my dear ?"
" Business , you know , may bring money , but friendship hardly ever does ."
As to men and women , our opinions are sometimes very different ; but with regard to these children , I observe we never disagree ."
There will be very little merit in making a good wife to such a man as Mr .
" Not at all ."
" I was going to observe , sir ," said Frank Churchill , " that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any body ' s catching cold -- so much less danger at the Crown than at Randalls !
and she and her partner the happiest !--" I said it would be so ," was the only consolation .
" And if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must conclude it to come from the Campbells ."
You had better look about you , and ascertain what you do , and what you mean to do ."
" You are right , Mrs . Weston ," said Mr . Knightley warmly , " Miss Fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs . Elton .
Harriet was standing at one of the windows .
But I must be more in want of a friend , or an agreeable companion , than I have yet been , to take the trouble of conquering any body ' s reserve to procure one .
Were she your equal in situation -- but , Emma , consider how far this is from being the case .
She had led her friend astray , and it would be a reproach to her for ever ; but her judgment was as strong as her feelings , and as strong as it had ever been before , in reprobating any such alliance for him , as most unequal and degrading .
ma ' am , but there may be a difficulty .
" I hope ," said he presently , " I have not been severe upon poor Mrs . Churchill .
It will do you good to speak of your distress , whatever it may be ."
Let me return your congratulations .-- I assure you that I have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction .-- He is a man whom I cannot presume to praise ."
I should like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the party ; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys .
I was sitting near the door -- Elizabeth saw me directly ; but he did not ; he was busy with the umbrella .
He must have had a wet ride .-- Yes .-- He meant to walk with her , she found .
That is a great thing .
There will be a great many people talking at once .
Here Mr . Weston joined them , and on hearing what was proposed , gave it his decided approbation .
Jane declined it , however , and the husband and wife walked off .
" And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while ; whenever there is any temptation of pleasure ."
With this inspiriting notion , her questions increased in number and meaning ; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr . Martin , and there was evidently no dislike to it .
A fine open sea , he says , and very pure air .
Miss Bates looked about her , so happily !--
Do not you pity me ?"
" I perfectly agree with you , sir ,"-- was then his remark .
I shall certainly be at leisure ."
He would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided : she was sure he would not -- and she was expecting him every moment to escape into the card - room .
" My dear , you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be plain , and that you yourself --"
He sat musing a little while , and then said ,
I have a very sincere interest in Emma .
She wanted , rather , to be quiet , and out of temptation ; but still , as it was desirable that she should appear , in general , like her usual self , she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance , and enter as warmly into Mr . and Mrs . Weston ' s disappointment , as might naturally belong to their friendship .
said I , ` I shall not forestall Jane ; I left her dancing with Mr . George Otway ; she will love to tell you all about it herself to - morrow : her first partner was Mr . Elton , I do not know who will ask her next , perhaps Mr . William Cox .'
