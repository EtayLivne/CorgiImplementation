I dared not address her openly ; my difficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well known to require definition ; and I was fortunate enough to prevail , before we parted at Weymouth , and to induce the most upright female mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement .-- Had she refused , I should have gone mad .-- But you will be ready to say , what was your hope in doing this ?-- What did you look forward to ?-- To any thing , every thing -- to time , chance , circumstance , slow effects , sudden bursts , perseverance and weariness , health and sickness .
certainly not too tall ; not in the least too tall .
Emma felt they were friends again ; and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction , and then a little sauciness , she could not help saying , as he was admiring the baby ,
I hope he will not mind it so very much ."
She might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments .
For a few days , every morning visit in Highbury included some mention of the handsome letter Mrs . Weston had received .
It was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty ; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to her -- nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and securing her affection .
He had no reason to wish his hair longer , to conceal any confusion of face ; no reason to wish the money unspent , to improve his spirits .
Till now that she was threatened with its loss , Emma had never known how much of her happiness depended on being _first_ with Mr . Knightley , first in interest and affection .-- Satisfied that it was so , and feeling it her due , she had enjoyed it without reflection ; and only in the dread of being supplanted , found how inexpressibly important it had been .-- Long , very long , she felt she had been first ; for , having no female connexions of his own , there had been only Isabella whose claims could be compared with hers , and she had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed Isabella .
there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to South End .
the amiable , obliging , gentle Mr .
" Oh !
She never mentioned it before , because she would not alarm us .
At present , there was nothing to be done for Harriet ; good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible on Emma ' s side .
Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young , handsome , rich , nor married .
I remember it was written from Weymouth , and dated Sept . 28th -- and began , ` My dear Madam ,' but I forget how it went on ; and it was signed ` F . C . Weston Churchill .'
Where _I_ sit is of no consequence .
With insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every body ' s feelings ; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every body ' s destiny .
Whether it was his own idea you know , one cannot tell .
" Exactly so -- The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth -- I have not a doubt of your success .
Nonsense !
And Mr . Weston at the same time , walking briskly with long steps through the passage , was calling out ,
Before he could return to his chair , it was taken by Mrs . Weston .
" You are a very warm friend to Mr . Martin ; but , as I said before , are unjust to Harriet .
The persons to be invited , required little thought .
As I am happily quite an altered creature in _one_ _respect_ , it is very fit that you should have the satisfaction of knowing it .
In one respect Mrs . Elton grew even worse than she had appeared at first .
" One can suppose nothing else ," added Mrs . Cole , " and I was only surprized that there could ever have been a doubt .
I admire all that quaint , old - fashioned politeness ; it is much more to my taste than modern ease ; modern ease often disgusts me .
CHAPTER XII
She had no sense of superiority then .
" My dear , how am I to get so far ?
To amuse her , and be agreeable in her eyes , seemed all that he cared for -- and Emma , glad to be enlivened , not sorry to be flattered , was gay and easy too , and gave him all the friendly encouragement , the admission to be gallant , which she had ever given in the first and most animating period of their acquaintance ; but which now , in her own estimation , meant nothing , though in the judgment of most people looking on it must have had such an appearance as no English word but flirtation could very well describe .
Here ,-- probably this basket with pink ribbon .
So she thought at first ;-- but a little consideration convinced her that every thing need not be put off .
" My Emma !"
There is to be no form or parade -- a sort of gipsy party .
" Yes , Frank came over this morning , just to ask us how we did ."
I am thwarted in every thing material .
I can think of but one thing -- Who is in love with her ?
Emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first .
He had given it , he could assure her , very long and calm consideration ; he had been walking away from William Larkins the whole morning , to have his thoughts to himself .
_She_ would notice her ; she would improve her ; she would detach her from her bad acquaintance , and introduce her into good society ; she would form her opinions and her manners .
" Such things do occur , undoubtedly ."
Highbury , that airy , cheerful , happy - looking Highbury , would be his constant attraction ."
Late hours do not agree with us .
Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed , without reproaches , or apparent sense of ill - usage ; and yet Emma fancied there was a something of resentment , a something bordering on it in her style , which increased the desirableness of their being separate .-- It might be only her own consciousness ; but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke .
" Dear me !-- How should I ever have borne it !
cried Harriet .
She loves piquet , you know ; but when she is gone home , I am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself , instead of going to bed at your usual time -- and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort .
So I said I would go down and see , and Jane said , ` Shall I go down instead ?
Jane declined it , however , and the husband and wife walked off .
This was the occurrence :-- The Coles had been settled some years in Highbury , and were very good sort of people -- friendly , liberal , and unpretending ; but , on the other hand , they were of low origin , in trade , and only moderately genteel .
said she .-- " The regularity and despatch of it !
I shall soon have done .
" Oh !
They are to be new set .
" The clerks grow expert from habit .-- They must begin with some quickness of sight and hand , and exercise improves them .
And as for Harriet , I will venture to say that _she_ cannot gain by the acquaintance .
Do help me .
it was such an inexpressible obligation !-- The very recollection of it , and all that I felt at the time -- when I saw him coming -- his noble look -- and my wretchedness before .
The danger , however , was at present so unperceived , that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her .
But here is my father coming : you will not object to my reading the charade to him .
Emma felt that she could not do too much for her , that Harriet had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience ; but it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing any effect , for ever agreed to , without being able to make their opinions the same .
She might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison , while a sharer of his conversation with her friend ; and from the best , the purest of motives , might now be denying herself this visit to Ireland , and resolving to divide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty .
Mr . Woodhouse hesitated .--" Not near so often , my dear , as I could wish ."
I will bring friends with me ."
I would rather not be tempted .
Where is it ?
He had turned away , and the horses were in motion .
She knew the importance of it , and said every thing in her power to do it away .
cried Mr . Weston , " about Perry and a carriage ?
She was too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply : and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for Mr . Elton ' s sanguine state of mind , he tried to take her hand again , as he joyously exclaimed --
But take care of yourself .
" We have been calling at Randalls ," said she , " and found them both at home ; and very pleasant people they seem to be .
He always speaks to the purpose ; open , straightforward , and very well judging .
Mr . and Mrs . John Knightley were to come down in August , and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back .
Emma saw how Mr . Weston understood these joyous prospects .
And poor John ' s son came to talk to Mr . Elton about relief from the parish ; he is very well to do himself , you know , being head man at the Crown , ostler , and every thing of that sort , but still he cannot keep his father without some help ; and so , when Mr . Elton came back , he told us what John ostler had been telling him , and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to Randalls to take Mr . Frank Churchill to Richmond .
" Oh !
" I have known her from a child , undoubtedly ; we have been children and women together ; and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate ,-- that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited her friends .
I am tired of doing nothing .
I am delighted to find that you can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander -- but it will not do -- very sorry to check you in your first essay -- but indeed it will not do .
It was short , but expressed good sense , warm attachment , liberality , propriety , even delicacy of feeling .
The last night ' s ball seemed lost in the gipsies .
" Was he handsome ?"
It was the end of an old pencil ,-- the part without any lead .
What has he to do with books ?
" Why do you smile ?"
As to the pretence of trying her native air , I look upon that as a mere excuse .-- In the summer it might have passed ; but what can any body ' s native air do for them in the months of January , February , and March ?
" I have not said , exert yourself Harriet for my sake ; think less , talk less of Mr . Elton for my sake ; because for your own sake rather , I would wish it to be done , for the sake of what is more important than my comfort , a habit of self - command in you , a consideration of what is your duty , an attention to propriety , an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others , to save your health and credit , and restore your tranquillity .
She would be respectable and happy ; and Emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the world , to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a man ;-- or , if not quite the luckiest , to yield only to herself .
Emma said it would be awkward ; Mrs . Weston was in distress about the supper ; and Mr . Woodhouse opposed it earnestly , on the score of health .
CHAPTER VII
But Emma still shook her head in steady scepticism .
" I wish we had a donkey .
Miss Bates should never again -- no , never !
If not wise or refined herself , she would have connected him with those who were ; but Miss Hawkins , it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit , had been the best of her own set .
And it is not merely the house -- the grounds , I assure you , as far as I could observe , are strikingly like .
" Imprudent , if you please -- but not mad .
