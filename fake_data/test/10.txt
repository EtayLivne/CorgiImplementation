Is it necessary for me to use any roundabout phrase ?-- Your Yorkshire friend -- your correspondent in Yorkshire ;-- that would be the way , I suppose , if I were very bad .-- No , I can pronounce his name without the smallest distress .
said she , beginning again when they were all in the street .
" No , I have not ; I know nothing ; pray tell me ."
Mr . Knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort !-- No longer walking in at all hours , as if ever willing to change his own home for their ' s !-- How was it to be endured ?
Arthur !-- How do you do ?
said she .--" To chuse to remain here month after month , under privations of every sort !
Knightley .-- Were this most unequal of all connexions to take place , on her must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning ; for his attachment , she must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of Harriet ' s ;-- and even were this not the case , he would never have known Harriet at all but for her folly .
The acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her .
Mr . Elton ' s engagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting Mr . Martin .
" Oh !
" You are not quite so miserable , though , as when you first came .
Mrs . Goddard , and the teachers , and the girls and the affairs of the school in general , formed naturally a great part of the conversation -- and but for her acquaintance with the Martins of Abbey - Mill Farm , it must have been the whole .
" Emma , I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do : a privilege rather endured than allowed , perhaps , but I must still use it .
" Not I , indeed .
Think , then , what I must have endured in hearing it bandied between the Eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition , and all the insolence of imaginary superiority .
But I have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she cared for .
But ( lowering her voice )-- nobody speaks except ourselves , and it is rather too much to be talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people ."
She was warmly gratified -- and in another moment still more so , by a little movement of more than common friendliness on his part .-- He took her hand ;-- whether she had not herself made the first motion , she could not say -- she might , perhaps , have rather offered it -- but he took her hand , pressed it , and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips -- when , from some fancy or other , he suddenly let it go .-- Why he should feel such a scruple , why he should change his mind when it was all but done , she could not perceive .-- He would have judged better , she thought , if he had not stopped .-- The intention , however , was indubitable ; and whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry , or however else it happened , but she thought nothing became him more .-- It was with him , of so simple , yet so dignified a nature .-- She could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction .
You are not just to Harriet ' s claims .
Aye , I remember it all now ; all , except your saving this relic -- I knew nothing of that till this moment -- but the cutting the finger , and my recommending court - plaister , and saying I had none about me !-- Oh !
Before the middle of the next day , he was at Hartfield ; and he entered the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of the scheme .
Mrs . Cole seemed to be relating something of her that was expected to be very interesting .
How to understand the deceptions she had been thus practising on herself , and living under !-- The blunders , the blindness of her own head and heart !-- she sat still , she walked about , she tried her own room , she tried the shrubbery -- in every place , every posture , she perceived that she had acted most weakly ; that she had been imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree ; that she had been imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying ; that she was wretched , and should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness .
My dear sir , you are too obliging .
Harriet is disgraced by any comparison .
We have never been there above once since the new approach was made ; but still I have no doubt that James will take you very safely .
Emma divined what every body present must be thinking .
" Who could have thought it ?
Very well ; I shall not attempt to deny Emma ' s being pretty ."
Perfect happiness , even in memory , is not common ; and there were two points on which she was not quite easy .
She had given them neither men , nor names , nor places , that could raise a blush .
I could not give any connected detail yesterday ; but the suddenness , and , in one light , the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out , needs explanation ; for though the event of the 26th ult ., as you will conclude , immediately opened to me the happiest prospects , I should not have presumed on such early measures , but from the very particular circumstances , which left me not an hour to lose .
" Yes , that of course ."
I am a great advocate for timidity -- and I am sure one does not often meet with it .-- But in those who are at all inferior , it is extremely prepossessing .
She was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke , and opening the casement there , immediately called Mr . Knightley ' s attention , and every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others , as if it had passed within the same apartment .
When you are tired of eating strawberries in the garden , there shall be cold meat in the house ."
When I look back to the first time I saw him !
If Colonel Campbell is not the person , who can be ?"
that is quite -- I suppose there never was a piece of news more generally interesting .
" And yet ," said Emma , beginning hastily and with an arch look , but soon stopping -- it was better , however , to know the worst at once -- she hurried on --" And yet , perhaps , you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is .
I rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness than I deserve .
if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax !"
I shall see you at the Abbey to - morrow morning I hope , and then we will look them over , and you shall give me your opinion ."
It was hardly right ; but it had been so strong an idea , that it would escape her , and his submission to all that she told , was a compliment to her penetration , which made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue .
I do not know a more luxurious state , sir , than sitting at one ' s ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women ; sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation .
And there was time enough for Emma to form a reasonable judgment , as their visit included all the rest of the morning .
The superior degree of confidence towards Harriet , which this one article marked , gave her severe pain .
CHAPTER XIV
She is always so attentive to them !"
said she .
I had a letter from him this morning , and he will be with us within a fortnight ."
They had received her doubtingly , if not coolly ; and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time -- till just at last , when Mrs . Martin ' s saying , all of a sudden , that she thought Miss Smith was grown , had brought on a more interesting subject , and a warmer manner .
She went on herself , to give that portion of time to an old servant who was married , and settled in Donwell .
She went to Mrs . Goddard ' s accordingly the very next day , to undergo the necessary penance of communication ; and a severe one it was .-- She had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding -- to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred -- and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis - judging in all her ideas on one subject , all her observations , all her convictions , all her prophecies for the last six weeks .
Though much might be fancy , he could not doubt , when he looked back , that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been half a year ago .
Angry as she was , the thought of the moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak .
This is like giving ourselves a slap , to be sure !
" I remember once calling you ` George ,' in one of my amiable fits , about ten years ago .
Emma ' s attempts to stop her father had been vain ; and when he had reached such a point as this , she could not wonder at her brother - in - law ' s breaking out .
no -- a very bad plan .
Miss Nash had told her all this , and had talked a great deal more about Mr . Elton ; and said , looking so very significantly at her , " that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be , but she only knew that any woman whom Mr . Elton could prefer , she should think the luckiest woman in the world ; for , beyond a doubt , Mr . Elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness ."
" I believe it is very true , my dear , indeed ," said Mr . Woodhouse , with a sigh .
He positively said that it had been known to no being in the world but their two selves ."
But this good old Mr . Woodhouse , I wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner .
You may believe me , Mrs . Weston .
" And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess ?-- I pity you .-- I thought you cleverer -- for , depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck .
Her views of improving her little friend ' s mind , by a great deal of useful reading and conversation , had never yet led to more than a few first chapters , and the intention of going on to - morrow .
Emma could not help laughing as she answered , " Upon my word , I believe you know her quite as well as I do .-- But , Mr . Knightley , are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright _accepted_ him .
Certainly his being at Randalls had given great spirit to the last two weeks -- indescribable spirit ; the idea , the expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought , the assurance of his attentions , his liveliness , his manners !
" You may _say_ what you chuse -- but your countenance testifies that your _thoughts_ on this subject are very much like mine ."
To Hartfield , if you please , Mrs .
I should not mind walking half the way .
This is delightful , is not it ?-- Where ' s dear Mr .
A little while ago , he was at Weymouth .
He is generally thought a fine young man , but do not expect a prodigy .
Knightley must not marry !-- You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell ?-- Oh !
" That is a grand pianoforte , and he might think it too large for Mrs . Bates ' s house ."
He was so much displeased , that it was longer than usual before he came to Hartfield again ; and when they did meet , his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven .
" Oh !
It was being very deficient ."
I have some notion of putting such a trimming as this to my white and silver poplin .
said Mr . Woodhouse , always the last to make his way in conversation ; " then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady .
" _You_ probably have been less surprized than any of us , for you have had your suspicions .-- I have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution .-- I wish I had attended to it -- but --( with a sinking voice and a heavy sigh ) I seem to have been doomed to blindness ."
Knightley !-- never seen him in her life before , and call him Knightley !-- and discover that he is a gentleman !
Do you know any family of that name ?"
" Are you sure ?
Poor Mr . Woodhouse trembled as he sat , and , as Emma had foreseen , would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again .
At present , there was nothing to be done for Harriet ; good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible on Emma ' s side .
He had not been at Donwell for two years .
We hear of him for ever at some watering - place or other .
Perry ' s setting up his carriage !
" What sort of looking man is Mr .
Emma ' s comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on , by Harriet ' s being to stay longer ; her fortnight was likely to be a month at least .
They were the first entitled , after Mrs . Weston and Emma , to be made happy ;-- from them he would have proceeded to Miss Fairfax , but she was so deep in conversation with John Knightley , that it would have been too positive an interruption ; and finding himself close to Mrs . Elton , and her attention disengaged , he necessarily began on the subject with her .
Quite otherwise indeed , if I understood Miss Fairfax ' s opinion last night ."
" It has a disagreeable look to me .
In half an hour the arrowroot was returned , with a thousand thanks from Miss Bates , but " dear Jane would not be satisfied without its being sent back ; it was a thing she could not take -- and , moreover , she insisted on her saying , that she was not at all in want of any thing ."
" Oh !
Come , sir , pray let me hear it ."
Indeed you should take care of yourself as well as of your friend .
