For it is not five minutes since I received Mrs . Cole ' s note -- no , it cannot be more than five -- or at least ten -- for I had got my bonnet and spencer on , just ready to come out -- I was only gone down to speak to Patty again about the pork -- Jane was standing in the passage -- were not you , Jane ?-- for my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting - pan large enough .
The pain of being obliged to practise concealment towards him , was very little inferior to the pain of having made Harriet unhappy .
" Ah !
So much superadded decision of character !
Harriet slept at Hartfield that night .
asked Mrs .
Considering the very superior claims of the object , it ought ; and judging by its apparently stronger effect on Harriet ' s mind , producing reserve and self - command , it would .-- She must communicate the painful truth , however , and as soon as possible .
My charge would be much more concise than her ' s , and probably not much in the same spirit ; all that I have to recommend being comprised in , do not spoil them , and do not physic them ."
" Good morning to you ,"-- said he , rising and walking off abruptly .
She continued to look back , but in vain ; and soon , with what appeared unusual speed , they were half way down the hill , and every thing left far behind .
do the children grow ?
Come , he knows himself there .
" Well !
She frequently gave me hints of it .
" Oh !
" Elegant , agreeable manners , I was prepared for ," said he ; " but I confess that , considering every thing , I had not expected more than a very tolerably well - looking woman of a certain age ; I did not know that I was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs .
-- thought Emma .--" You have not deserved this .
Three months , she says so , positively , as I am going to have the pleasure of reading to you .
He had hoped she would speak again , but she did not .
You need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment ."
Do not tell his father , but that young man is not quite the thing .
Harriet , Mr . Elton , and Mr . Knightley , their own especial set , were the only persons invited to meet them ;-- the hours were to be early , as well as the numbers few ; Mr . Woodhouse ' s habits and inclination being consulted in every thing .
" Well , I have so little confidence in my own judgment , that whenever I marry , I hope some body will chuse my wife for me .
I am here till claimed by Colonel and Mrs .
The speech was more to Emma than to Harriet , which Emma could understand .
It was a long , well - written letter , giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings , expressing all the affection , gratitude , and respect which was natural and honourable , and describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed attractive , with spirit and precision .
The day came , the party were punctually assembled , and Mr . John Knightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable .
Mrs . Churchill was unwell -- far too unwell to do without him ; she had been in a very suffering state ( so said her husband ) when writing to her nephew two days before , though from her usual unwillingness to give pain , and constant habit of never thinking of herself , she had not mentioned it ; but now she was too ill to trifle , and must entreat him to set off for Enscombe without delay .
" No trouble in the world , ma ' am ," said the obliging Mrs . Ford .
I always deserve the best treatment , because I never put up with any other ; and , therefore , you must give me a plain , direct answer .
Harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude .
" No , indeed , I shall grant you nothing .
he told me all about it ; that Jane Fairfax and Mr . Frank Churchill are to be married , and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while .
" No , no ; your room is full enough .
No doubt he is a sensible man , and I suppose may have a natural talent for -- thinks strongly and clearly -- and when he takes a pen in hand , his thoughts naturally find proper words .
What do you imagine his age to be ?"
" These are the sights , Harriet , to do one good .
go to - day , go to - day .
" Yes : but a young lady -- a bride -- I ought to have paid my respects to her if possible .
said Mr . Woodhouse , always the last to make his way in conversation ; " then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady .
Miss Woodhouse , believe me I have not the presumption to suppose -- Indeed I am not so mad .-- But it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a distance -- and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world , with the gratitude , wonder , and veneration , which are so proper , in me especially ."
" Never , madam ," cried he , affronted in his turn : " never , I assure you .
He had been going to call on them .
Her spirits seemed overcome .
And , in short , from knowing his usual ways , I am very much inclined to think that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all .
I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill ; when , provoked by such conduct on my side , such shameful , insolent neglect of her , and such apparent devotion to Miss W ., as it would have been impossible for any woman of sense to endure , she spoke her resentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me .-- In short , my dear madam , it was a quarrel blameless on her side , abominable on mine ; and I returned the same evening to Richmond , though I might have staid with you till the next morning , merely because I would be as angry with her as possible .
How the trampers might have behaved , had the young ladies been more courageous , must be doubtful ; but such an invitation for attack could not be resisted ; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen children , headed by a stout woman and a great boy , all clamorous , and impertinent in look , though not absolutely in word .-- More and more frightened , she immediately promised them money , and taking out her purse , gave them a shilling , and begged them not to want more , or to use her ill .-- She was then able to walk , though but slowly , and was moving away -- but her terror and her purse were too tempting , and she was followed , or rather surrounded , by the whole gang , demanding more .
He thought much of the evils of the journey for her , and not a little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some of the party the last half of the way ; but his alarms were needless ; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished , and Mr . and Mrs . John Knightley , their five children , and a competent number of nursery - maids , all reaching Hartfield in safety .
" Poor Miss Taylor !-- I wish she were here again .
And no apology left , no message for me .
I shall have no fears for you with him .
very unaccountable !
There must be ample room in it for every real comfort .
" Can you trust me with such flatterers ?-- Does my vain spirit ever tell me I am wrong ?"
When the Campbells are returned , we shall meet them in London , and continue there , I trust , till we may carry her northward .-- But now , I am at such a distance from her -- is not it hard , Miss Woodhouse ?-- Till this morning , we have not once met since the day of reconciliation .
" Oh !
.
Humph -- Harriet ' s ready wit !
Every door was now closed , the passage plan given up , and the first scheme of dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again ; and with such good - will on Frank Churchill ' s part , that the space which a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple , was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough for ten .
It was not likely , however , that any body should have equalled her in the date of the plan , as it had entered her brain during the very first evening of Harriet ' s coming to Hartfield .
dear Mrs . Elton , so obliged to you for the carriage !-- excellent time .
for the very moment Mr . Cole told Mrs . Cole of it , she sat down and wrote to me .
Still , however , affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment .
for shame !"
But whether he were entirely free from peculiar attachment -- whether there were no actual preference -- remained a little longer doubtful .
VOLUME III
" Ah !
And at last , as if resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object , he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person .
Human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting situations , that a young person , who either marries or dies , is sure of being kindly spoken of .
From Frank Churchill ' s face , where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away , he had involuntarily turned to hers ; but she was indeed behind , and too busy with her shawl .
There is no use in delay .
" Ah !
" _I_ sick of prosperity and indulgence !
He is in Highbury every now and then , and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to Kingston .
My nephews and nieces !-- I shall often have a niece with me ."
" Oftentimes very convenient , no doubt , but never pleasing .
I have no pleasure in seeing my friends , unless I can believe myself fit to be seen ."
It was growing late , and Miss Bates became anxious to get home , on her mother ' s account .
This was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by , and Mr . Weston , with a very good grace , immediately exclaimed ,
yes , very .
The happiness of Miss Smith was quite equal to her intentions .
His lady greeted him with some of her sparkling vivacity .
Charming people , Mr . and Mrs . Weston ;-- Mrs . Weston indeed is much beyond praise , and he is exactly what one values , so hospitable , and so fond of society ;-- it will be a small party , but where small parties are select , they are perhaps the most agreeable of any .
The idea of Mr . Elton was certainly cheering ; but still , after a time , she was tender - hearted again towards the rejected Mr . Martin .
It did assist ; for though he began with grave looks and short questions , he was soon led on to talk of them all in the usual way , and to take the child out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity .
Mrs . John Knightley was a pretty , elegant little woman , of gentle , quiet manners , and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate ; wrapt up in her family ; a devoted wife , a doating mother , and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that , but for these higher ties , a warmer love might have seemed impossible .
" Oh yes , papa .
She meant to be very happy , in spite of the scene being laid at Mr . Cole ' s ; and without being able to forget that among the failings of Mr . Elton , even in the days of his favour , none had disturbed her more than his propensity to dine with Mr . Cole .
" I mean that he has done it ," answered Mr . Knightley , with smiling but determined decision , " and been accepted ."
Her affection must have overpowered her judgment ."
I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall make this rivet quite firm .
Emma hoped it must rapidly work Harriet ' s cure ; but the sensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very much .-- It was not to be doubted that poor Harriet ' s attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve , and her own share in the story , under a colouring the least favourable to her and the most soothing to him , had in all likelihood been given also .
" I shall never let that book go out of my own hands ," said she .
" This man is almost too gallant to be in love ," thought Emma .
The event was more favourable to Mr . Woodhouse than to Emma .
` I am sure you must be ,' said he , ` and I will send you another supply ; for I have a great many more than I can ever use .
That would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance !
He did not think we ever walked this road .
The difference in that respect of Richmond and London was enough to make the whole difference of seeing him always and seeing him never .
I have no fears at all for myself ; and I should have no scruples of staying as late as Mrs . Weston , but on your account .
