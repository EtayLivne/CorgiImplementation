Her nerves were under continual irritation and suffering ; and by the ten days ' end , her nephew ' s letter to Randalls communicated a change of plan .
I found Harriet more conversable than I expected ."
There was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest , and it caught Emma ' s attention only as it united with the subject which already engaged her mind .
We shall be most happy to consider you as one of the party ."
" Well ," said Emma , willing to let it pass --" you want to hear about the wedding ; and I shall be happy to tell you , for we all behaved charmingly .
Perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can : at any rate do not let them carry you far , unless you are persuaded of his liking you .
Jane ' s curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to occupy her .
The wedding was very much like other weddings , where the parties have no taste for finery or parade ; and Mrs . Elton , from the particulars detailed by her husband , thought it all extremely shabby , and very inferior to her own .--" Very little white satin , very few lace veils ; a most pitiful business !-- Selina would stare when she heard of it ."
He was not calm ; his spirits were evidently fluttered ; there was restlessness about him .
" Oh !
no , I could not endure William Coxe -- a pert young lawyer ."
He laughed rather consciously ; and though denying the sentiment , Emma was convinced that it had been so .
said Frank Churchill .
The subject followed ; it was in plain , unaffected , gentlemanlike English , such as Mr . Knightley used even to the woman he was in love with , how to be able to ask her to marry him , without attacking the happiness of her father .
It could be protracted no longer .
How do you all do ?-- Quite well , I am much obliged to you .
No more is Emma .
If the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize , it must have been the death of me .
" You may well class the delight , the honour , and the comfort of such a situation together ," said Jane , " they are pretty sure to be equal ; however , I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me .
But the sight of Mr . Knightley among the most attentive , soon drew away half Emma ' s mind ; and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of Mrs . Weston ' s suspicions , to which the sweet sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions .
impossible !"
CHAPTER X
He was soon pretty well resigned .
The listeners were amused ; and Mrs . Weston gave Emma a look of particular meaning .
" I should not wonder ," said Mrs . Weston , " if Miss Fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination , by her aunt ' s eagerness in accepting Mrs . Elton ' s civilities for her .
How it might be considered by the rest of the party , she could not tell .
Pray take care , Miss Woodhouse , ours is rather a dark staircase -- rather darker and narrower than one could wish .
My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings , Lords of the earth !
She spoke with a confidence which staggered , with a satisfaction which silenced , Mr . Knightley .
It does not bear talking of ."
But it is very remarkable that she should always hear Jane better than she does me .
The acquaintance at present had no charm for her .
" Increase !"
Dear Harriet !-- I would not change you for the clearest - headed , longest - sighted , best - judging female breathing .
As Harriet now lived , the Martins could not get at her , without seeking her , where hitherto they had wanted either the courage or the condescension to seek her ; for since her refusal of the brother , the sisters never had been at Mrs . Goddard ' s ; and a twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again , with any necessity , or even any power of speech .
His face lengthened immediately ; and his voice was the voice of sentiment as he answered .
She had no scruple with regard to him .
His appearance was very neat , and he looked like a sensible young man , but his person had no other advantage ; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen , she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet ' s inclination .
" So much the better -- or so much the worse :-- I do not know which .
But ah !
" No ,"-- he calmly replied ,--" there is but one married woman in the world whom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to Donwell , and that one is --"
There was merit in every drawing -- in the least finished , perhaps the most ; her style was spirited ; but had there been much less , or had there been ten times more , the delight and admiration of her two companions would have been the same .
Dear Miss Woodhouse , how could you so mistake me ?"
And is she , at seventeen , just entering into life , just beginning to be known , to be wondered at because she does not accept the first offer she receives ?
I am in no hurry .
Perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can : at any rate do not let them carry you far , unless you are persuaded of his liking you .
" Much , indeed !"
At present , I ask only to hear , once to hear your voice ."
How else could they come ?"
No , my dear little modest Harriet , depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond - street till just before he mounts his horse to - morrow .
" I do not know what I could imagine , but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers .
Granted ;-- for private enjoyment ; and for private enjoyment keep them .
Forcing herself to speak , therefore , in the hope of putting it by , she calmly said ,
She thought so well of the letter , that when Mr . Knightley came again , she desired him to read it .
A likeness pleases every body ; and Miss Woodhouse ' s performances must be capital .
when a gallant young man , like Mr . Frank Churchill ," said Mr . Knightley dryly , " writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse , he will , of course , put forth his best ."
" No ; not immediately here .
Why does not Perry see her ?"
But now I have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in January ."
Emma would be " very happy to wait on Mrs . Bates , & c .," and they did at last move out of the shop , with no farther delay from Miss Bates than ,
A mind lively and at ease , can do with seeing nothing , and can see nothing that does not answer .
They all united ; and , on reaching Hartfield gates , Emma , who knew it was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father , pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him .
said John Knightley .
I am not in the least ashamed of my meaning ."
" Thank you , sir , thank you ; I am going this moment myself ; and I think the sooner _you_ go the better .
I have taken some pains for your sake , and for Robert Martin ' s sake , ( whom I have always had reason to believe as much in love with her as ever ,) to get acquainted with her .
I behaved shamefully .
" Me !-- not at all ," replied Mr . Knightley , rather displeased ; " I do not want to think ill of him .
You mentioned it as what was certainly to be very soon .
and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things ?"
I never could have an idea of any body else -- and so I thought you knew .
Emma agreed to it , and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet ' s account , which she could not give any sincere explanation of .
I am sure he was particularly silent when Mrs . Cole told us of it at dinner ."
Of all the sources of evil surrounding the former , since her coming to Highbury , she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst .
A fine place , but very retired ."
It was his idea to bring her to Hartfield : he had thought of no other place .
Gratifying , however , and stimulative as was the letter in the material part , its sentiments , she yet found , when it was folded up and returned to Mrs . Weston , that it had not added any lasting warmth , that she could still do without the writer , and that he must learn to do without her .
With a little reserve of manner , Emma continued :
" Ah !
Emma could not doubt .
Ah !
I shall write to Mrs . Partridge in a day or two , and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look - out for any thing eligible ."
While poor Mrs . Churchill lived , I suppose there could not have been a hope , a chance , a possibility ;-- but scarcely are her remains at rest in the family vault , than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required .
I am determined against all interference .
" Well ," said she , " and you soon silenced Mr . Cole , I suppose ?"
I am very little able -- Have you a chair , ma ' am ?
my dear ,' said I -- well , and just then came the note .
" There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than you used to be .
We will follow them to Hartfield .
" Are you well , my Emma ?"
That is what she writes about .
The corner of the sofa is very good .
The invitation was refused , and by a verbal message .
It did assist ; for though he began with grave looks and short questions , he was soon led on to talk of them all in the usual way , and to take the child out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity .
No , you shall send it to Hartfield , if you please .
She read , and was surprized .
My brother and sister will be enchanted with this place .
For Miss ----------, read Miss Smith .
Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with her grandmother and aunt , and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state .
But while I visit at Hartfield , and you are so kind to me , Miss Woodhouse , I am not afraid of what any body can do ."
