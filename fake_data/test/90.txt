I used to be quite angry with Selina ; but really I begin now to comprehend that a married woman has many things to call her attention .
I had no hesitation in advising him to marry .
" Oh !"
Not that James ever complains ; but it is right to spare our horses when we can .
" And I have not forgotten ," said Emma , " how sure you were that he might have come sooner if he would .
are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr .
So I said , I was very much obliged to him : you know I could not do less ; and then he went back to Elizabeth , and I came round by the stables -- I believe I did -- but I hardly knew where I was , or any thing about it .
You must have heard every thing to be sure .
" It is a sort of thing ," cried Mrs . Elton emphatically , " which _I_ should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into .
" No -- Mrs . Knightley ;-- and till she is in being , I will manage such matters myself ."
-- said Emma , still perplexed .
I had no intention , I thought I had no power of staying more than five minutes , when I first entered the house .
The want of proper families in the place , and the conviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted to attend , were mentioned ; but he was not satisfied .
An abominable puppy !-- You know who I mean ( nodding to her husband ).
" I like your plan ," cried Mr . Weston .
He appeared to have a very open temper -- certainly a very cheerful and lively one ; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions , a great deal decidedly right ; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard , was fond of talking of him -- said he would be the best man in the world if he were left to himself ; and though there was no being attached to the aunt , he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude , and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect .
A ready - furnished house in a favourite spot was engaged , and much benefit expected from the change .
It inspired little more than an animating curiosity .
And Mr . Weston at the same time , walking briskly with long steps through the passage , was calling out ,
Things did not seem -- that is , there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some .-- So it appeared to me at least , but I might be mistaken .
As a walking companion , Emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her .
" My being charming , Harriet , is not quite enough to induce me to marry ; I must find other people charming -- one other person at least .
It then occurred to her to employ him in reading .
It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home ; and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society or other , it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house , too wise to stir out ; and to hear him say to Mr . Knightley , whom no weather could keep entirely from them ,--
I had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name , which I was not at all pleased with .
CHAPTER VII
Mrs . Weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion .
Mr . Martin , I imagine , has his fortune entirely to make -- cannot be at all beforehand with the world .
It was but an effusion of lively spirits .
Colonel Campbell , you know , is quite our angel .
She is not a clever girl , but she has better sense than you are aware of , and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly .
While I , to blind the world to our engagement , was behaving one hour with objectionable particularity to another woman , was she to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made every previous caution useless ?-- Had we been met walking together between Donwell and Highbury , the truth must have been suspected .-- I was mad enough , however , to resent .-- I doubted her affection .
Dear me !
do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax ' s sensations from you , or from any body else .
I really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey .
In the daily interchange of news , they must be again restricted to the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings ' coming had been united , such as the last accounts of Mrs . Churchill , whose health seemed every day to supply a different report , and the situation of Mrs . Weston , whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child , as that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it .
Mrs . Weston , capital in her country - dances , was seated , and beginning an irresistible waltz ; and Frank Churchill , coming up with most becoming gallantry to Emma , had secured her hand , and led her up to the top .
" I think her beautiful , quite beautiful ."
" No , to be sure you could not ; but I never thought of that before .
If we feel for the wretched , enough to do all we can for them , the rest is empty sympathy , only distressing to ourselves ."
Perry ?-- Has he been here this morning ?-- And how does he travel now ?-- Has he set up his carriage ?"
They sang together once more ; and Emma would then resign her place to Miss Fairfax , whose performance , both vocal and instrumental , she never could attempt to conceal from herself , was infinitely superior to her own .
" Now ,"-- said Emma , when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates ,-- " now Mr . Weston , do let me know what has happened ."
As for _his_ going , Emma did not wish him to think it possible , the hours would be too late , and the party too numerous .
And in this style he talked on for some time very properly , not much attending to any answer , but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat ; and Emma was quite in charity with him .
She had fallen into good hands , known nothing but kindness from the Campbells , and been given an excellent education .
With respect to her father , it was a question soon answered .
It was too old a story .-- Robert Martin had probably ceased to think of Harriet .-- They took a few turns together along the walk .-- The shade was most refreshing , and Emma found it the pleasantest part of the day .
In two minutes , however , he relented in his own favour ; and muttering something about spruce - beer , walked off .
If a separation of two months should not have cooled him , there were dangers and evils before her :-- caution for him and for herself would be necessary .
" You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates ," said Emma .
" Well -- but if any difficulties should arise , my housekeeper is extremely clever ."
He knows that he is a very handsome young man , and a great favourite wherever he goes ; and from his general way of talking in unreserved moments , when there are only men present , I am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away .
" On your side , my love , it was very innocently done .
She was too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply : and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for Mr . Elton ' s sanguine state of mind , he tried to take her hand again , as he joyously exclaimed --
Excepting inequality of fortune , and perhaps a little disparity of age , I can see nothing unsuitable ."
Selina is no fine lady , I assure you .
Mrs . Elton ' s invitations I should have imagined any thing but inviting ."
I believe I did not play with the children quite so much as usual .
--
" Nothing can be actually settled yet , perhaps ," replied Emma , smiling --" but , excuse me , it must be thought of ."
Mrs . Elton left them no choice .
With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate , she had resolved at one - and - twenty to complete the sacrifice , and retire from all the pleasures of life , of rational intercourse , equal society , peace and hope , to penance and mortification for ever .
John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection , and Isabella always thinks as he does ; except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children .
Mrs . Elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly .
And she is a good - natured woman after all .
She does not depend upon his coming so much as I do : but she does not know the parties so well as I do .
Woodhouse , who had already taken his little round in the highest part of the gardens , where no damps from the river were imagined even by him , stirred no more ; and his daughter resolved to remain with him , that Mrs . Weston might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety which her spirits seemed to need .
Neither would Mr . Knightley ' s downright , decided , commanding sort of manner , though it suits _him_ very well ; his figure , and look , and situation in life seem to allow it ; but if any young man were to set about copying him , he would not be sufferable .
I think you play quite as well as she does .
Emma spoke her pity so very kindly , that with a sudden accession of gay thought , he cried ,
I need not so totally despair of an equal alliance , as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith !-- No , madam , my visits to Hartfield have been for yourself only ; and the encouragement I received --"
He thanked her with all his heart , and continued some time to speak with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness .
Nobody can be more devoted to home than I am .
She could not enter the house again , could not be in the same room to which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago , to lace up her boot , without _recollecting_ .
We will not be parted .
I dare say he will come in when he knows who is here .
You would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way , if you were married ."
She is not to pay for the offence of others , by being held below the level of those with whom she is brought up .-- There can scarcely be a doubt that her father is a gentleman -- and a gentleman of fortune .-- Her allowance is very liberal ; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfort .-- That she is a gentleman ' s daughter , is indubitable to me ; that she associates with gentlemen ' s daughters , no one , I apprehend , will deny .-- She is superior to Mr . Robert Martin ."
Pray make my excuses and adieus to her ."
He recommended it for all the children , but particularly for the weakness in little Bella ' s throat ,-- both sea air and bathing ."
I could very ill be spared -- but such a point had been made of my coming !
In the warmth of true contrition , she would call upon her the very next morning , and it should be the beginning , on her side , of a regular , equal , kindly intercourse .
The rest of the gentlemen being now in the room , Emma found herself obliged to turn from him for a few minutes , and listen to Mr . Cole .
He was accused of having a delightful voice , and a perfect knowledge of music ; which was properly denied ; and that he knew nothing of the matter , and had no voice at all , roundly asserted .
" You are comfortable because you are under command ."
This made a difficulty .
" Oh no !
You are too obliging , my dear Miss Woodhouse ; but we really must take leave .
How does Miss Smith do ?
It ought to have been a habit with him by this time , of following his duty , instead of consulting expediency .
You quite shock me ; if you mean a fling at the slave - trade , I assure you Mr . Suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition ."
" Some very fine morning , he , and Emma , and Harriet , could go very well ; and he could sit still with Mrs . Weston , while the dear girls walked about the gardens .
After a few minutes of entire silence between them , John Knightley began with --
" Yes ; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays .
It is too unlikely , for me to believe it without proof ."
Her regard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him , and her regrets kept alive , and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss Hawkins ' s happiness , and continual observation of , how much he seemed attached !-- his air as he walked by the house -- the very sitting of his hat , being all in proof of how much he was in love !
" Might not they use both rooms , and dance across the passage ?"
Papa , do you not think it an excellent improvement ?"
Mr . Knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment , and that not another syllable of communication could rest with him .
