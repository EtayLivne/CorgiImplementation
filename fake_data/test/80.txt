The wedding over , and the bride - people gone , her father and herself were left to dine together , with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening .
" Oh !
There is safety in reserve , but no attraction .
" My dear , you do not understand me .
" Trouble !
It was enough for her to feel .
Pray take care , Miss Woodhouse , ours is rather a dark staircase -- rather darker and narrower than one could wish .
He saw a short word prepared for Emma , and given to her with a look sly and demure .
But I have done with expecting any course of steady reading from Emma .
She was nobody when he married her , barely the daughter of a gentleman ; but ever since her being turned into a Churchill she has out - Churchill ' d them all in high and mighty claims : but in herself , I assure you , she is an upstart ."
They never could have been all three together , without her having stabbed Jane Fairfax ' s peace in a thousand instances ; and on Box Hill , perhaps , it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no more .
She will be disagreeable in infancy , and correct herself as she grows older .
Their propriety , simplicity , and elegance , would make them the safest model for any young woman ."
He knew of no one but Mrs . Goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or friends .
Harriet had not surmised her own danger , but the idea of it struck her forcibly .
" We are going to Box Hill to - morrow ;-- you will join us .
where shall we sit ?
so silly -- so satisfied -- so smiling -- so prosing -- so undistinguishing and unfastidious -- and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me , I would marry to - morrow .
Emma looked graciously .
Its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each other !
The hair was curled , and the maid sent away , and Emma sat down to think and be miserable .-- It was a wretched business indeed !-- Such an overthrow of every thing she had been wishing for !-- Such a development of every thing most unwelcome !-- Such a blow for Harriet !-- that was the worst of all .
" Dear Mrs . Weston , how could you think of such a thing ?-- Mr .
He argued like a young man very much bent on dancing ; and Emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of the Weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the Churchills .
She had frequently thought -- especially since his father ' s marriage with Miss Taylor -- that if she _were_ to marry , he was the very person to suit her in age , character and condition .
Depend upon it he had encouragement ."
she was as grateful as possible , you may be sure .
.
Has Perry seen her ?
It was rather too late in the day to set about being simple - minded and ignorant ; but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of being humble and discreet , and repressing imagination all the rest of her life .
dear ; I was so miserable !
Do not let us be too solemn on the business .
Somebody had placed her , several years back , at Mrs . Goddard ' s school , and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlour - boarder .
` Well ,' said she , ` it must be borne some time or other , and it may as well be now .'
I know Mr . John Knightley too well -- I am very sure he understands the value of friendship as well as any body .
Two such could never be granted .
Oh !
I must make myself very disagreeable , or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend ."
To know that he has not thrown himself away , is such a comfort !-- She does seem a charming young woman , just what he deserves .
The impossibility of her quitting her father , Mr . Knightley felt as strongly as herself ; but the inadmissibility of any other change , he could not agree to .
For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself .
" I know you , I know you ; you would take up with any thing ; but I shall be a little more nice , and I am sure the good Campbells will be quite on my side ; with your superior talents , you have a right to move in the first circle .
--" She believed he was reckoned a very fine young man ."
I have been but half a friend to her ; and if she were _not_ to feel this disappointment so very much , I am sure I have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable for her ;-- William Coxe -- Oh !
Here is the rivet of your mistress ' s spectacles out .
" Good God !"
He saw that Emma had soon made it out , and found it highly entertaining , though it was something which she judged it proper to appear to censure ; for she said , " Nonsense !
You may be very sure I shall always take care of _them_ ."
" If I can come again , we are still to have our ball .
Half a dozen natural children , perhaps -- and poor Frank cut off !-- This , though very undesirable , would be no matter of agony to her .
Every body is so surprized ; and every body says the same obliging things .
Emma thought at least it would turn out so .
He had left them completely frightened ; and Harriet eagerly clinging to him , and hardly able to speak , had just strength enough to reach Hartfield , before her spirits were quite overcome .
But you , ( turning to Mr . Knightley ,) who know how very , very seldom I am ever two hours from Hartfield , why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me , I cannot imagine .
There he had not always the patience that could have been wished .
She cast her eye over it , pondered , caught the meaning , read it through again to be quite certain , and quite mistress of the lines , and then passing it to Harriet , sat happily smiling , and saying to herself , while Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope and dulness , " Very well , Mr . Elton , very well indeed .
She wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration .
This was the knowledge of herself , on the first question of inquiry , which she reached ; and without being long in reaching it .-- She was most sorrowfully indignant ; ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed to her -- her affection for Mr .
' Tis a sad business ."
" _He_ is undoubtedly very much in love -- every thing denotes it -- very much in love indeed !-- and when he comes again , if his affection continue , I must be on my guard not to encourage it .-- It would be most inexcusable to do otherwise , as my own mind is quite made up .
" I am afraid ," returned Emma , sighing , " that I must often have contributed to make her unhappy ."
I cannot let you continue in your error ; and yet , perhaps , since my manners gave such an impression , I have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have been at all attached to the person we are speaking of , as it might be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse .-- But I never have ."
Her own conduct , as well as her own heart , was before her in the same few minutes .
" He has been used to her in these complaints , and I hope to - morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report .
[ To Mrs .
I assure you mine are very different .
my dear , human flesh !
Her sensibilities , I suspect , are strong -- and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance , patience , self - controul ; but it wants openness .
You need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment ."
She had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from her heart , for he stopped to hand her out .
" I was only going to observe , that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women , I cannot imagine them to be very frequent .
Harriet , who had been standing in no unhappy reverie , was yet very glad to be called from it , by the now encouraging manner of such a judge , and such a friend as Miss Woodhouse , and only wanted invitation , to give the history of her hopes with great , though trembling delight .-- Emma ' s tremblings as she asked , and as she listened , were better concealed than Harriet ' s , but they were not less .
Those soft blue eyes , and all those natural graces , should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its connexions .
Any other situation would have been much less in character .
And I have no doubt that he _will_ thrive , and be a very rich man in time -- and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb _us_ ."
-- seemed to burst from an overcharged heart , and to describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her , even towards some of those who loved her best .
" Well ," said Mrs . Weston , laughing , " perhaps the greatest good he could do them , would be to give Jane such a respectable home ."
Miss Woodhouse , the comfort of being sometimes alone !"
His recollection of Harriet , and the words which clothed it , the " beautiful little friend ," suggested to her the idea of Harriet ' s succeeding her in his affections .
" He was four - and - twenty the 8th of last June , and my birthday is the 23rd just a fortnight and a day ' s difference -- which is very odd ."
You cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me !
" But , my dear papa , it is supposed to be summer ; a warm day in summer .
I made the match , you know , four years ago ; and to have it take place , and be proved in the right , when so many people said Mr . Weston would never marry again , may comfort me for any thing ."
Soon afterwards Mr . Elton quitted them , and she could not but do him the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his manner of naming Harriet at parting ; in the tone of his voice while assuring her that he should call at Mrs . Goddard ' s for news of her fair friend , the last thing before he prepared for the happiness of meeting her again , when he hoped to be able to give a better report ; and he sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his favour .
Emma ' s answer was ready at the first word .
It was , indeed , so odd ; Harriet ' s behaviour was so extremely odd , that Emma did not know how to understand it .
It was not closed , however , it still remained ajar ; but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation , she hoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room .
She was stopped by a slight fit of coughing , and Mr . Weston instantly seized the opportunity of going on .
My mother often talks of your good - nature .
My daughter and I are both highly sensible of your goodness , and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield ."
" You know what you are about ."
" My dear , dear anxious friend ,"-- said she , in mental soliloquy , while walking downstairs from her own room , " always overcareful for every body ' s comfort but your own ; I see you now in all your little fidgets , going again and again into his room , to be sure that all is right ."
convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about Hartfield .
I should wish it ."
Do not mimic her .
I care for nothing else .
I do suspect that he is not really necessary to my happiness .
But she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he had done , of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree .
And putting up her hand to screen her words from Emma --" A congratulatory visit , you know .-- Oh !
You need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here .
no , it is a meeting at the Crown , a regular meeting .
