I am sure it was a source of high entertainment to you , to feel that you were taking us all in .-- Perhaps I am the readier to suspect , because , to tell you the truth , I think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same situation .
Mr . Woodhouse agreed to it all , but added ,
She speaks a little too quick .
Emma saw him only once ; but two or three times every day Harriet was sure _just_ to meet with him , or _just_ to miss him , _just_ to hear his voice , or see his shoulder , _just_ to have something occur to preserve him in her fancy , in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture .
Emma could hardly understand him ; he seemed in an odd humour .
" On the misery of what she had suffered , during the concealment of so many months ," continued Mrs . Weston , " she was energetic .
" Aye , we men are sad fellows .
Will you ?
He had been sitting with her , it appeared , most companionably at home , till her usual hour of exercise ; and on being desired to chuse their walk , immediately fixed on Highbury .--" He did not doubt there being very pleasant walks in every direction , but if left to him , he should always chuse the same .
I promised my wife to leave it all to her .
But Mr . Weston is almost an old man .
He had time only to say ,
But after all the punishment that misconduct can bring , it is still not less misconduct .
And then not to find him at home !
Let me recommend Bath to you .
They were going to remove immediately to Richmond .
" So early in life -- at three - and - twenty -- a period when , if a man chuses a wife , he generally chuses ill . At three - and - twenty to have drawn such a prize !
" This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted , and Mr . Weston has done very well for himself ; but he must have knocked up every body else .
If you want any farther explanation ," continued he , smiling , " they are paid for it .
It is a great deal more natural than one could wish , that a young man , brought up by those who are proud , luxurious , and selfish , should be proud , luxurious , and selfish too .
She has been gone longer already than she intended ."
" Oh !
-- But Mrs . Elton was very much discomposed indeed .--" Poor Knightley !
We are rather out of distance of the very striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of ; and we are a very quiet set of people , I believe ; more disposed to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure ."
There was deep consciousness about him , and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend ' s .
They separated too much into parties .
" He will have every body ' s wishes for his happiness ."
" Oh !
no , indeed ; I must protest against any such idea .
He was reckoned very handsome ; his person much admired in general , though not by her , there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense with :-- but the girl who could be gratified by a Robert Martin ' s riding about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by Mr . Elton ' s admiration .
Selina is no fine lady , I assure you .
Another song , however , was soon begged for .
" Oftentimes very convenient , no doubt , but never pleasing .
It was a delightful visit ;-- perfect , in being much too short .
I am sure they will bring him soon ."
She is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom , with probably no settled provision at all , and certainly no respectable relations .
cried Emma , putting her hand before her face , and jumping up , " you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear .
( with a little sigh of sentiment ).
was not that her own doing too ?
If this is living in the country , it is nothing very formidable .
For the world would not she have seemed to threaten me .-- Imagine the shock ; imagine how , till I had actually detected my own blunder , I raved at the blunders of the post .-- What was to be done ?-- One thing only .-- I must speak to my uncle .
" Just as they always do -- very vulgar ."
" But you should tell them of the letter , my dear ," said her father .
" If you are very kind ," said he , " it will be one of the waltzes we danced last night ;-- let me live them over again .
" You speak too plain .
I am sure I had much rather hear you .
He was always agreeable and obliging , and speaking pleasantly of every body .
after the note I sent him this morning , and the message he returned , that he should certainly be at home till one ."
Emma was sure he had not forgiven her ; he looked unlike himself .
I should not be helped so soon , but it smells most excellent , and I cannot help beginning ."
The worn - out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming ; and in the rapidity of half a moment ' s thought , she hoped Mr . Elton would now be talked of no more .
Robert Martin would never have proceeded so far , if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him .
" I am concerned to hear of it .
Dear Miss Woodhouse , do advise me ."
Mr . Knightley , I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case .
The result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words .
" That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast , of my present perfect indifference ," she continued , " I will farther tell you , that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance , when I did like him , when I was very much disposed to be attached to him -- nay , was attached -- and how it came to cease , is perhaps the wonder .
And yet it was far , very far , from impossible .-- Was it a new circumstance for a man of first - rate abilities to be captivated by very inferior powers ?
You begged hard to be commanded to come ."
No , he could not believe it a bad house ; not such a house as a man was to be pitied for having .
I am quite determined to refuse him .
To be sure , the charade , with its " ready wit "-- but then the " soft eyes "-- in fact it suited neither ; it was a jumble without taste or truth .
The doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other .
And as to its recommendations to _you_ , I fancy I need not take much pains to dwell on them .
" Thank you , dear Miss Woodhouse , you are all kindness .-- It is impossible to say -- Yes , indeed , I quite understand -- dearest Jane ' s prospects -- that is , I do not mean .-- But she is charmingly recovered .-- How is Mr .
If you do not call early it will be a slight ."
He had found her agitated and low .-- Frank Churchill was a villain .-- He heard her declare that she had never loved him .
Oh !
Remember ."
There is a littleness about him which you discovered , and which I did not : and I was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet .
Emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech , from his wife .
" You do quite right ," said she ;--" we will make your apologies to Mr . and Mrs .
" What a comfort it is , that we think alike about our nephews and nieces .
Miss Smith , and Miss Bickerton , another parlour boarder at Mrs . Goddard ' s , who had been also at the ball , had walked out together , and taken a road , the Richmond road , which , though apparently public enough for safety , had led them into alarm .-- About half a mile beyond Highbury , making a sudden turn , and deeply shaded by elms on each side , it became for a considerable stretch very retired ; and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it , they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them , on a broader patch of greensward by the side , a party of gipsies .
Elton ?"
While he talked to Isabella , however , Emma found an opportunity of saying ,
but her lips were closed .
She must have delighted the Coles -- worthy people , who deserved to be made happy !-- And left a name behind her that would not soon die away .
If a separation of two months should not have cooled him , there were dangers and evils before her :-- caution for him and for herself would be necessary .
You see how delightfully she writes .
It was very wrong of me , you know , to keep any remembrances , after he was married .
Mrs . Weston would be at ease .
Very happy to hear it .
Oh !
I had not thought of it before , but that is the best way .
of Mr .
-- She did not suspect him .
Mr . Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury , and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed , though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life .
" It was certainly never brilliant , but she would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general ; and there was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face ."
My daughter and I are both highly sensible of your goodness , and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield ."
After a mutual silence of some minutes , Harriet thus began again --
do you recommend this side ?-- Well , I am sure , Mr . Churchill -- only it seems too good -- but just as you please .
And Mr . Dixon seems a very charming young man , quite worthy of him .
."
I shall not attempt calling on Mrs . Goddard , for I really do not think she cares for any thing but _boiled_ pork : when we dress the leg it will be another thing .
In half a minute they were in the room .
" This sensation of listlessness , weariness , stupidity , this disinclination to sit down and employ myself , this feeling of every thing ' s being dull and insipid about the house !-- I must be in love ; I should be the oddest creature in the world if I were not -- for a few weeks at least .
Her observation had been pretty correct .
However , this does make a difference ; and , perhaps , when we come to talk it over -- but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration .
" Good God !"
