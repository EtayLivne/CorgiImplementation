Have patience with me , I shall soon have done .-- She closed with this offer , resolving to break with me entirely , and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again .-- _She_ _felt_ _the_ _engagement_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _source_ _of_ _repentance_ _and_ _misery_ _to_ _each_ : _she_ _dissolved_ _it_ .-- This letter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt ' s death .
He only means --"
He thought it very well done of Mr . Knightley to invite them -- very kind and sensible -- much cleverer than dining out .-- He was not fond of dining out ."
And as to smaller - sized rooms than I had been used to , I really could not give it a thought .
Upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated .
Campbell ."
Here Mr . Weston joined them , and on hearing what was proposed , gave it his decided approbation .
--
Emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from their knowing each other , which had taken strong possession of her mind , had ever crossed his ; and whether his compliments were to be considered as marks of acquiescence , or proofs of defiance .
She rose early , and wrote her letter to Harriet ; an employment which left her so very serious , so nearly sad , that Mr . Knightley , in walking up to Hartfield to breakfast , did not arrive at all too soon ; and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him , literally and figuratively , was quite necessary to reinstate her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before .
" And now that I understand your question , I must pronounce it to be a very unfair one .
What has he to do with books ?
It was the very circumstance he could have wished for .
" Poor Jane Fairfax !"
.
She was a great talker upon little matters , which exactly suited Mr . Woodhouse , full of trivial communications and harmless gossip .
" You were mentioning May .
Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home , and thought this the best offer she was likely to have ."
It was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being employed on such an errand ."
" I saw you first in February .
Well , and how did Mr . Churchill take it ?"
" Mr . Knightley and Jane Fairfax !"
Oh !
There was no immediate appearance .
Emma laughed , and replied ,
" How d ' ye do ?-- how d ' ye do ?-- Very well , I thank you .
I would give any money for it .
It ought to have been a habit with him by this time , of following his duty , instead of consulting expediency .
She never mentioned it before , because she would not alarm us .
No suspicious flourishes now of apology or concern ; it was the language of real feeling towards Mrs . Weston ; and the transition from Highbury to Enscombe , the contrast between the places in some of the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt , and how much more might have been said but for the restraints of propriety .-- The charm of her own name was not wanting .
He asked my opinion as to what he was now to do .
Will not the old prejudice be too strong ?"
_Now_ you have nothing to try for .
Her early attachment to herself was very amiable ; and her inclination for good company , and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever , shewed that there was no want of taste , though strength of understanding must not be expected .
" Harriet !"
" You are silent , Miss Fairfax -- but I hope you mean to take an interest in this news .
" Oh , dear ," cried Harriet , " now I recollect what you mean ; but I was thinking of something very different at the time .
" I do not think it _is_ so very small .
" And here is Mrs . Weston and Mr . Frank Churchill too !-- Quite delightful ; so many friends !"
" And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her !
I have no doubt of his having , at times , considerable influence ; but it may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand _when_ it will be ."
And so excellent in the Church !
I admired your spirit ; and I dare say we shall get home very well .
And that is all that I can recollect of it -- but it is very clever all the way through .
A large debt of gratitude was owing here ; but the intercourse of the last seven years , the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed Isabella ' s marriage , on their being left to each other , was yet a dearer , tenderer recollection .
Oh !
Pass Mr . E ., Knightley , Jane , and myself .
She had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother , but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother ' s unreasonable anger , nor from missing the luxuries of her former home .
What has he been judging by ?-- I am not conscious of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this time for my marrying any more than at another .-- But it was so , I suppose .
" And now that I understand your question , I must pronounce it to be a very unfair one .
He had just read Elton ' s letter as I was shewn in , and handed it to me directly ."
Had the same behaviour continued , Miss Smith might have been led into a misconception of your views ; not being aware , probably , any more than myself , of the very great inequality which you are so sensible of .
But I will shew her greater attention than I have done ."
Mr . Dixon ' s preference of her music to her friend ' s , I can answer for being very decided ."
But Miss Bates soon came --" Very happy and obliged "-- but Emma ' s conscience told her that there was not the same cheerful volubility as before -- less ease of look and manner .
The aunt and niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room .
" My dear Jane , what is this I hear ?-- Going to the post - office in the rain !-- This must not be , I assure you .-- You sad girl , how could you do such a thing ?-- It is a sign I was not there to take care of you ."
" It was her very particular friend , you know ."
If I had not promoted Mr . Weston ' s visits here , and given many little encouragements , and smoothed many little matters , it might not have come to any thing after all .
Nobody can be more devoted to home than I am .
The acquaintance at present had no charm for her .
I really am a most troublesome companion to you both , but I hope I am not often so ill - equipped .
He had been at the pains of consulting Mr . Perry , the apothecary , on the subject .
Mr . John Knightley was a tall , gentleman - like , and very clever man ; rising in his profession , domestic , and respectable in his private character ; but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally pleasing ; and capable of being sometimes out of humour .
" It is not fair ," said Emma , in a whisper ; " mine was a random guess .
He may be very ` aimable ,' have very good manners , and be very agreeable ; but he can have no English delicacy towards the feelings of other people : nothing really amiable about him ."
Then , if you please , you shall send it all to Mrs . Goddard ' s -- I do not know -- No , I think , Miss Woodhouse , I may just as well have it sent to Hartfield , and take it home with me at night .
Enscombe is in Yorkshire ?"
Perhaps I may sometimes have felt that Harriet would not forget what was due -- or rather what would be kind by me ."
You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies -- quite a horror of them .
" She would rather not be in his company more than she could help .
" We are sure of excellent fires ," continued he , " and every thing in the greatest comfort .
" Oh !
" I must spend some time with them ; I am sure they will want it ;-- afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself .
They must not do less than others , or she should be exposed to odious suspicions , and imagined capable of pitiful resentment .
" Mr . Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse flirted together excessively ."
how so ?
" This is a pleasure ," said he , in rather a low voice , " coming at least ten minutes earlier than I had calculated .
Within half an hour it was known all over Highbury .
" Ah !
"` Smallridge !'
" I am perfectly satisfied ," replied Emma , with the brightest smiles , " and most sincerely wish them happy ."
It is such enjoyment to them , that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of their taking turns , whichever began would never give way to the other ."
Not a speck on them ."
My dear sir , you are too obliging .-- Is there nobody you would not rather ?-- I am not helpless .
Mr . Knightley could not be there too often ; he should be glad to see him every day ;-- but they did see him every day as it was .-- Why could not they go on as they had done ?
-- Emma had promised ; but still Harriet must be excepted .
" I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years ' experience , and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child .
" So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax ?"
` I will not say , that since I entered into the engagement I have not had some happy moments ; but I can say , that I have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour :'-- and the quivering lip , Emma , which uttered it , was an attestation that I felt at my heart ."
Yes , Harriet , just so long have I been wanting the very circumstance to happen what has happened .
I dare not let my mother know how little she eats -- so I say one thing and then I say another , and it passes off .
He proceeded a little farther , reading to himself ; and then , with a smile , observed , " Humph !
" Such an extraordinary dream of mine !"
" Is she unwell ?"
It will do you good to speak of your distress , whatever it may be ."
But how shall I do ?
Miss Churchill , however , being of age , and with the full command of her fortune -- though her fortune bore no proportion to the family - estate -- was not to be dissuaded from the marriage , and it took place , to the infinite mortification of Mr . and Mrs . Churchill , who threw her off with due decorum .
It was a very extraordinary thing !
I could very ill be spared -- but such a point had been made of my coming !
