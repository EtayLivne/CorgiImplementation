In another moment a happier sight caught her ;-- Mr . Knightley leading Harriet to the set !-- Never had she been more surprized , seldom more delighted , than at that instant .
It was almost enough to make her think of marrying .
Mr . Knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment , and that not another syllable of communication could rest with him .
" But really , I am half ashamed , and wish I had never taken up the idea ."
Your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name your own terms , have as many rooms as you like , and mix in the family as much as you chose ;-- that is -- I do not know -- if you knew the harp , you might do all that , I am very sure ; but you sing as well as play ;-- yes , I really believe you might , even without the harp , stipulate for what you chose ;-- and you must and shall be delightfully , honourably and comfortably settled before the Campbells or I have any rest ."
" Oh !
He was too angry to say another word ; her manner too decided to invite supplication ; and in this state of swelling resentment , and mutually deep mortification , they had to continue together a few minutes longer , for the fears of Mr . Woodhouse had confined them to a foot - pace .
The next remove was to the house ; they must all go in and eat ;-- and they were all seated and busy , and still Frank Churchill did not come .
" I wish we had a donkey .
He came to speak to his father on a subject ,-- to announce an attachment --"
It was no more than the principals were prepared for ; they had calculated from the time of its being known at Randalls , how soon it would be over Highbury ; and were thinking of themselves , as the evening wonder in many a family circle , with great sagacity .
Considering the very particular friendship between her and Mrs . Dixon , you could hardly have expected her to be excused from accompanying Colonel and Mrs .
And , without love , I am sure I should be a fool to change such a situation as mine .
We both abhor suspense .
" Well , there _is_ feeling here .-- He does seem to have suffered in finding her ill .-- Certainly , I can have no doubt of his being fond of her .
" I shall not scold you .
Emma soon recollected , and understood him ; and while she joined in the laugh , it was evident from Jane ' s countenance that she too was really hearing him , though trying to seem deaf .
Either bathing has been of the greatest service to her , or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of Mr . Wingfield ' s , which we have been applying at times ever since August ."
No sacrifice on any side worth the name .
" Robert Martin has no great loss -- if he can but think so ; and I hope it will not be long before he does .
Decidedly , I think , a very gentleman - like man ."
" To a Mrs . Smallridge -- charming woman -- most superior -- to have the charge of her three little girls -- delightful children .
She had not deserved it ; she had often been negligent or perverse , slighting his advice , or even wilfully opposing him , insensible of half his merits , and quarrelling with him because he would not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own -- but still , from family attachment and habit , and thorough excellence of mind , he had loved her , and watched over her from a girl , with an endeavour to improve her , and an anxiety for her doing right , which no other creature had at all shared .
Any thing else I should be most happy to do , at your command -- but my dancing days are over ."
Mr . Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick leather gaiters , and either the exertion of getting them together , or some other cause , brought the colour into his face , as he answered ,
The truth is , Harriet , that my playing is just good enough to be praised , but Jane Fairfax ' s is much beyond it ."
I wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings .
And , in short , from knowing his usual ways , I am very much inclined to think that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all .
He is not a gallant man , but he is a very humane one ; and this , considering Jane Fairfax ' s ill - health , would appear a case of humanity to him ;-- and for an act of unostentatious kindness , there is nobody whom I would fix on more than on Mr . Knightley .
" No ; not immediately here .
But I do not understand how the room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father ' s house ."
He loved to have the cloth laid , because it had been the fashion of his youth , but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it ; and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing , his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat .
Frank was standing by her , but not steadily ; there was a restlessness , which shewed a mind not at ease .
He will be here this evening , I dare say , and then I will give it him back , and some nonsense or other will pass between us , and you shall not be committed .-- Your soft eyes shall chuse their own time for beaming .
I told you that I did not wonder at your attachment ; that considering the service he had rendered you , it was extremely natural :-- and you agreed to it , expressing yourself very warmly as to your sense of that service , and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward to your rescue .-- The impression of it is strong on my memory ."
I should not wonder if it were to bring on the declaration .
If she were to meet Miss Bates in her way !-- and upon its beginning to rain , Emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be detaining her at Mrs . Goddard ' s , and that the intelligence would undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation .
There is always some talent in it .
By this time , the walk in the rain had reached Mrs . Elton , and her remonstrances now opened upon Jane .
I cannot recollect .-- It is very odd , but I cannot recollect .-- Mr .
She promised him again and again to come -- much oftener than he doubted -- and was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy , such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it .
Mr . Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it , besides all the history of his own and Isabella ' s coming , and of Emma ' s being to follow , and had indeed just got to the end of his satisfaction that James should come and see his daughter , when the others appeared , and Mrs . Weston , who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him , was able to turn away and welcome her dear Emma .
That Frank Churchill thought less of her than he had done , was indubitable .
( turning to Emma .)
He was not a great favourite with his fair sister - in - law .
" No indeed I have not .
One cannot creep upon a journey ; one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned ; and the pleasure of coming in upon one ' s friends before the look - out begins , is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs ."
The shower was heavy , but short ; and it had not been over five minutes , when in came Harriet , with just the heated , agitated look which hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give ; and the " Oh !
He was not exactly what she had expected ; less of the man of the world in some of his notions , less of the spoiled child of fortune , therefore better than she had expected .
" Oh no , no !
Do not let mine continue longer .
They were looking over views in Swisserland .
Jane ' s alertness in moving , proved her as ready as her aunt had preconceived .
" That is what you have in your head , I know -- and what you would certainly say if my father were not by ."
" Knightley !"
I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions , though you make so noble a profession of doing it , but I honestly tell you what they are ."
dear , no ," said her companion .
He had , by that time , realised an easy competence -- enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining Highbury , which he had always longed for -- enough to marry a woman as portionless even as Miss Taylor , and to live according to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition .
" Oh !
When this was over , Mr . Woodhouse gratefully observed , " It is very kind of you , Mr . Knightley , to come out at this late hour to call upon us .
She thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself , to have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her instead of his brother .
Do not you remember what Mr . Perry said , so many years ago , when I had the measles ?
Selina has entirely given up music -- never touches the instrument -- though she played sweetly .
What blindness , what madness , had led her on !
" My dearest papa !
" It is to be a secret , I conclude ," said he .
" Thank you , dear Miss Woodhouse .
In spite of all her faults , she knew she was dear to him ; might she not say , very dear ?-- When the suggestions of hope , however , which must follow here , presented themselves , she could not presume to indulge them .
You blush , Harriet .-- Does any body else occur to you at this moment under such a definition ?
I shall never forget it .
` Oh !'
" Here is his answer , if you like to see it ."
" He is very young to settle ," was Mr . Woodhouse ' s observation .
If _she_ had so misinterpreted his feelings , she had little right to wonder that _he_ , with self - interest to blind him , should have mistaken hers .
" No , I am sure it is not from the Campbells .
A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked , or because he is attached to her , and can write a tolerable letter ."
" My dearest Emma ," said he , " for dearest you will always be , whatever the event of this hour ' s conversation , my dearest , most beloved Emma -- tell me at once .
But from one cause or another , I gave it up in disgust .
A very few minutes more , however , completed the present trial .
Mrs . Weston , I am not to be talked out of my dislike of Harriet Smith , or my dread of its doing them both harm ."
" I can never think of it ," she cried , " without extreme shame ."
Jane desired me to do it , so I always do : and so I began to - day with my usual caution ; but no sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell , than I burst out , quite frightened , with ` Bless me !
Isabella cannot bear to stay behind her husband ."
" Well ," said Emma , " there is no disputing about taste .-- At least you admire her except her complexion ."
You see we have been wedging one leg with paper .
" Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon ?"
Her youth had passed without distinction , and her middle of life was devoted to the care of a failing mother , and the endeavour to make a small income go as far as possible .
` Woman , lovely woman .'
Now do not you feel that you had ?
Mrs . Weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion .
Emma , in good spirits too , from the amusement afforded her mind by the expectation of Mr . Frank Churchill , was willing to forget his late improprieties , and be as well satisfied with him as before , and on his making Harriet his very first subject , was ready to listen with most friendly smiles .
It was her superior duty .
She had given them neither men , nor names , nor places , that could raise a blush .
There could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs . John Knightley , in this short visit to Hartfield , going about every morning among her old acquaintance with her five children , and talking over what she had done every evening with her father and sister .
The time of year lightened the evil to him .
He is an excellent young man , both as son and brother .
Were she your equal in situation -- but , Emma , consider how far this is from being the case .
I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held ."
He is an excellent young man , both as son and brother .
She felt that she should like to have had the power of refusal ; and afterwards , as the idea of the party to be assembled there , consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her , occurred again and again , she did not know that she might not have been tempted to accept .
