This is just what Perry said .
Jane declined it , however , and the husband and wife walked off .
Let us forgive each other at once .
" I have not been working uninterruptedly ," he replied , " I have been assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily , it was not quite firm ; an unevenness in the floor , I believe .
However , she is very agreeable , and Mrs . Bates too , in a different way .
And after such success , you know !-- Every body said that Mr . Weston would never marry again .
" I will say no more about him ," cried Emma , " you turn every thing to evil .
" That may be -- but not by sketches in Swisserland .
There was a little hesitation in Emma ' s answer .
You would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way , if you were married ."
" Oh !
He is but young , and his uncle , perhaps --"
And now , let me talk to you of something else .
It is not likely that I _should_ , considering what I have been used to .
Our coachman and horses are so extremely expeditious !-- I believe we drive faster than any body .-- What a pleasure it is to send one ' s carriage for a friend !-- I understand you were so kind as to offer , but another time it will be quite unnecessary .
" I cannot imagine ," said Mrs . Elton , ( feeling the indignity as a wife ought to do ,) " I cannot imagine how he could do such a thing by you , of all people in the world !
yes "-- he replied ; " I was just going to mention it .
They are not at all the less written you know , because you divide them .
" Such an imagination has crossed me , I own , Emma ; and if it never occurred to you before , you may as well take it into consideration now ."
She felt your full meaning .
" One would rather have a stranger preferred than one ' s very particular friend -- with a stranger it might not recur again -- but the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand , to do every thing better than one does oneself !-- Poor Mrs . Dixon !
.
Concession must be out of the question ; but it was time to appear to forget that they had ever quarrelled ; and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration of friendship , that when he came into the room she had one of the children with her -- the youngest , a nice little girl about eight months old , who was now making her first visit to Hartfield , and very happy to be danced about in her aunt ' s arms .
" No -- I have never seen Mr . Elton ," she replied , starting on this appeal ; " is he -- is he a tall man ?"
What is it ?-- why do you smile so ?-- where did you hear it ?-- at Randalls ?"
-- with many other relative questions , all answered with patient politeness .
He comes to Highbury himself , he says , six days out of the seven , and has always business at Ford ' s .
It appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature .
This will be complete enjoyment ; and I do not know , Mrs . Elton , whether the uncertainty of our meetings , the sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to - day or to - morrow , and at any hour , may not be more friendly to happiness than having him actually in the house .
They shew her to the greatest advantage .
He had long made up his mind to Jane Fairfax ' s going out as governess , and could talk of it cheerfully , but Mr . Knightley ' s going to London had been an unexpected blow .
She was not obliged to hear .
and so forth -- I always felt that something would happen in our favour ; and so it has , you see .
She opened the parlour door , and saw two gentlemen sitting with her father -- Mr . Weston and his son .
She saw that Enscombe could not satisfy , and that Highbury , taken at its best , might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement at home than he liked .
" You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill , I presume ," he continued -- " and know him to be my son , though he does not bear my name ."
Let me recommend Bath to you .
Let my father ' s servant go with you .-- Let me order the carriage .
There was no time for farther remark or explanation .
I do not know her , even by sight ."
" Her friends must all be sorry to lose her ; and will not Colonel and Mrs . Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their return ?"
My poor mother does not know how to bear it .
Name your day , and I will come .
Well , ( returning to the room ,) I have not been able to succeed .
Your views for Harriet are best known to yourself ; but as you make no secret of your love of match - making , it is fair to suppose that views , and plans , and projects you have ;-- and as a friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton is the man , I think it will be all labour in vain ."
Emma knew that she had , but would not own it ; and Mr . Elton warmly added ,
They had been speaking of it as they walked about Highbury the day before , and Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence .
They are but too apt to give up music ."
The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day .
The very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten !-- My dear Mr . E ., he must have left a message for you , I am sure he must .-- Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric ;-- and his servants forgot it .
" I do remember it ," cried Emma ; " I perfectly remember it .-- Talking about spruce - beer .-- Oh !
" Dear affectionate creature !-- _You_ banished to Abbey - Mill Farm !-- _You_ confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life !
said Emma playfully .
Her eyes were towards Donwell as she walked , but she saw him not .
Vanity , extravagance , love of change , restlessness of temper , which must be doing something , good or bad ; heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs . Weston , indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general ; he became liable to all these charges .
There was hardly time to talk over the first letter from Enscombe before " Mr . Elton and his bride " was in every body ' s mouth , and Frank Churchill was forgotten .
But I live out of the world , and am often astonished at what I hear .
And I hate Italian singing .-- There is no understanding a word of it .
Churchill ?"
They seem very comfortable as they are , and if she were to take any pains to marry him , she would probably repent it .
She did not do any of it in the same way that she used ; I could see she was altered ; but , however , she seemed to _try_ to be very friendly , and we shook hands , and stood talking some time ; but I know no more what I said -- I was in such a tremble !-- I remember she said she was sorry we never met now ; which I thought almost too kind !
Even _your_ satisfaction I made sure of .
-- He met her at the parlour - door , and hardly asking her how she did , in the natural key of his voice , sunk it immediately , to say , unheard by her father ,
I should like to see Emma in love , and in some doubt of a return ; it would do her good .
Harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager exclamation .
She asked after their mutual friends ; they were all well .-- When had he left them ?-- Only that morning .
Enscombe is in Yorkshire ?"
If I were to marry , I must expect to repent it ."
Isabella stept in after her father ; John Knightley , forgetting that he did not belong to their party , stept in after his wife very naturally ; so that Emma found , on being escorted and followed into the second carriage by Mr . Elton , that the door was to be lawfully shut on them , and that they were to have a tete - a - tete drive .
he told me all about it ; that Jane Fairfax and Mr . Frank Churchill are to be married , and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while .
" When Frank left us ," continued he , " it was quite uncertain when we might see him again , which makes this day ' s news doubly welcome .
You are more likely to have done harm to yourself , than good to them , by interference ."
So I said I would go down and see , and Jane said , ` Shall I go down instead ?
She was obliged to repeat and explain it , before it was fully comprehended ; and then , being quite new , farther representations were necessary to make it acceptable .
I could not go away you know , because of the rain ; but I did so wish myself anywhere in the world but there .-- Oh !
" The post - office is a wonderful establishment !"
I hope you will be pleased with my son ; but you must not expect a prodigy .
If I could but see her again !-- But I must not propose it yet .
You are so much used to live alone , that you do not know the value of a companion ; and , perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex , after being used to it all her life .
" Who could have thought it ?
said she , with a conscious look .
He laughed rather consciously ; and though denying the sentiment , Emma was convinced that it had been so .
Emma saw its artifice , and returned to her first surmises .
Harriet had not surmised her own danger , but the idea of it struck her forcibly .
Still , however , though every thing had not been accomplished by her ingenious device , she could not but flatter herself that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both , and must be leading them forward to the great event .
_Now_ I shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you ."
" No , it by no means wanted strength -- it was not a large hand , but very clear and certainly strong .
It was not with Mrs . Suckling , it was not with Mrs . Bragge , but in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them : it was with a cousin of Mrs . Bragge , an acquaintance of Mrs . Suckling , a lady known at Maple Grove .
" Never mind , Harriet , I shall not be a poor old maid ; and it is poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public !
" But you need not imagine Mr . Weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up Henry or John .
While they were thus comfortably occupied , Mr . Woodhouse was enjoying a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter .
But , Mr . Knightley , how could you possibly have heard it ?
The first error and the worst lay at her door .
But she was not wanted to speak .
" She is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one ' s eyes from .
" My dearest papa !
However , she seems a very obliging , pretty - behaved young lady , and no doubt will make him a very good wife .
She had taken up the idea , she supposed , and made every thing bend to it .
" We shall never agree about him ," cried Emma ; " but that is nothing extraordinary .
But this does not acquit _him_ , Mrs . Weston ; and I must say , that I think him greatly to blame .
