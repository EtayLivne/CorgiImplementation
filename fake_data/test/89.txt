Mr . Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way .
A conundrum of Mr . Weston ' s shall clear him and his next neighbour .
I may not have convinced you perhaps , but I am perfectly convinced myself that Mr . Dixon is a principal in the business ."
Had you not been surrounded by other friends , I might have been tempted to introduce a subject , to ask questions , to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct .-- I feel that I should certainly have been impertinent ."
She was immediately up , and wanting to quit the table ; but so many were also moving , that she could not get away ; and Mr . Knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards her , and resolutely swept away by her unexamined .
She frequently gave me hints of it .
He was not hungry ; it would only make him hotter ."
You will never go to Swisserland .
" You saw her answer !-- you wrote her answer too .
They have no indoors man , else they do not want for any thing ; and Mrs . Martin talks of taking a boy another year ."
And I will own to you , ( I am sure it will be safe ), that so far as our living with Mr . Churchill at Enscombe , it is settled .
Not that James ever complains ; but it is right to spare our horses when we can .
He never can bear to be thanked .
Emma ' s answer was ready at the first word .
It would not have been the awkwardness of a moment , it would have been rather a pleasure , previous to the suspicions of this very day ; she could have talked to him of Harriet , and the three - quarters of a mile would have seemed but one .
One would fancy we were bosom friends !
It seemed quite a shame , especially considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away .
There is my father -- another of my father -- but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous , that I could only take him by stealth ; neither of them very like therefore .
You seem shut out from every thing -- in the most complete retirement .-- And Mrs . Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion .
" Harriet !"
do you recommend this side ?-- Well , I am sure , Mr . Churchill -- only it seems too good -- but just as you please .
Emma liked the subject so well , that she began upon it , to Mrs . Weston , very soon after their moving into the drawing - room : wishing her joy -- yet observing , that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming .-- Mrs . Weston agreed to it ; but added , that she should be very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked of : " for I cannot depend upon his coming .
Though she did not feel the first intelligence as she might have done the day before , or an hour before , its interest soon increased ; and before their first conversation was over , she had talked herself into all the sensations of curiosity , wonder and regret , pain and pleasure , as to this fortunate Miss Hawkins , which could conduce to place the Martins under proper subordination in her fancy .
What strength , or what constancy of affection he might be subject to , was another point ; but at present she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration , a conscious preference of herself ; and this persuasion , joined to all the rest , made her think that she _must_ be a little in love with him , in spite of every previous determination against it .
In that respect Mrs . Weston ' s loss had been important .
Mr . Knightley and Harriet had arrived during her absence , and were sitting with her father .-- Mr .
She was always quick and assured : Isabella slow and diffident .
They sang together once more ; and Emma would then resign her place to Miss Fairfax , whose performance , both vocal and instrumental , she never could attempt to conceal from herself , was infinitely superior to her own .
She and Mr . Frank Churchill had been at Weymouth at the same time .
" There it is .
There was no occasion to press the matter farther .
Well , ( smiling ,) I hope it may be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers , it has done all that is truly important .
" Oh !
But Miss Bates soon came --" Very happy and obliged "-- but Emma ' s conscience told her that there was not the same cheerful volubility as before -- less ease of look and manner .
" I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind ; but excuse me , Mr . Knightley , if I take the liberty ( I consider myself , you know , as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma ' s mother might have had ) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith ' s intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you .
It is not likely that I _should_ , considering what I have been used to .
To her he looked for comfort ; and her assurances of safety , her representation of the excellence of the horses , and of James , and of their having so many friends about them , revived him a little .
Mr . Elton was called out of the room before tea , old John Abdy ' s son wanted to speak with him .
A very successful visit :-- I saw all the three ladies ; and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint .
cried Emma , shaking her head .--" Ah !
" Never !
What do you imagine his age to be ?"
CHAPTER VI
Used only to a large house himself , and without ever thinking how many advantages and accommodations were attached to its size , he could be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one .
But still I cannot imagine she would not be persuaded ."
I see no advantage in consulting Miss Bates ."
Come , he knows himself there .
Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings , Mr . and Mrs . Weston ' s visit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune .
You need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here .
Vanity , extravagance , love of change , restlessness of temper , which must be doing something , good or bad ; heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs . Weston , indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general ; he became liable to all these charges .
The event was more favourable to Mr . Woodhouse than to Emma .
Only three of us .-- besides dear Jane at present -- and she really eats nothing -- makes such a shocking breakfast , you would be quite frightened if you saw it .
He can sit down and write a fine flourishing letter , full of professions and falsehoods , and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father ' s having any right to complain .
The invitation was refused , and by a verbal message .
Letters are no matter of indifference ; they are generally a very positive curse ."
and so forth -- I always felt that something would happen in our favour ; and so it has , you see .
Mrs . Elton is very good - natured and agreeable , and I dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought to be .
You are so much used to live alone , that you do not know the value of a companion ; and , perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex , after being used to it all her life .
Mr . Churchill , independent of his wife , was feared by nobody ; an easy , guidable man , to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew .
Quite the queen of the evening !-- Well , here we are at the passage .
" You will soon be cooler , if you sit still ," said Emma .
Oh !
Her eyes were towards Donwell as she walked , but she saw him not .
Your meaning must be unequivocal ; no doubts or demurs : and such expressions of gratitude and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires , will present themselves unbidden to _your_ mind , I am persuaded .
" So do I ," said Mrs . Weston gently , " very much ."
Mr . Churchill would never get over it ."
A man who had been in motion since eight o ' clock in the morning , and might now have been still , who had been long talking , and might have been silent , who had been in more than one crowd , and might have been alone !-- Such a man , to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside , and on the evening of a cold sleety April day rush out again into the world !-- Could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken back his wife , there would have been a motive ; but his coming would probably prolong rather than break up the party .
Mrs . Elton had received notice of it that morning , and was in raptures .
Mr . Weston is such a good - humoured , pleasant , excellent man , that he thoroughly deserves a good wife ;-- and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for ever , and bear all my odd humours , when she might have a house of her own ?"
" I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case ," replied Emma ; " but am disposed to side with you , Mr . Weston .
She did not repent what she had done ; she still thought herself a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be ; but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general , which made her dislike having it so loudly against her ; and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state , was very disagreeable .
Her father was growing nervous , and could not understand _her_ .
Indeed I must say that , much as I had heard of him before and much as I had expected , he very far exceeds any thing .
While he staid , the Martins were forgotten ; and on the very morning of his setting off for Bath again , Emma , to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned , judged it best for her to return Elizabeth Martin ' s visit .
" Ah !
No , she had had enough of interference .
Considering the very particular friendship between her and Mrs . Dixon , you could hardly have expected her to be excused from accompanying Colonel and Mrs .
" Not quite .
And it is not merely the house -- the grounds , I assure you , as far as I could observe , are strikingly like .
Here is the rivet of your mistress ' s spectacles out .
" I dare say your apologies were accepted , sir .
had it , by any blessed felicity , occurred to her , to institute the comparison .-- She saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider Mr . Knightley as infinitely the superior , or when his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear .
" How much I am obliged to you ," said he , " for telling me to come to - day !-- If it had not been for you , I should certainly have lost all the happiness of this party .
" And who do you think came in while we were there ?"
It was some comfort to him that many inquiries after himself and Miss Woodhouse ( for his neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after ), as well as Miss Smith , were coming in during the rest of the day ; and he had the pleasure of returning for answer , that they were all very indifferent -- which , though not exactly true , for she was perfectly well , and Harriet not much otherwise , Emma would not interfere with .
It would amuse away the difficulties of her part , and lessen the irksomeness of Miss Smith ' s ."
" Yes , very true .
Cannot you invent a few hardships for yourself , and be contented to stay ?"
" John does not even mention your friend ," said Mr . Knightley .
I would much rather have been merry than wise ."
But still I cannot imagine she would not be persuaded ."
.
Nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible .
" That is a grand pianoforte , and he might think it too large for Mrs . Bates ' s house ."
poor Harriet !"
The style of the visit , and the shortness of it , were then felt to be decisive .
If there had not been so much anger , there would have been desperate awkwardness ; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment .
After another short hesitation , " I hope it does not proceed from -- I hope it is not in compliment to Mr .
A little curiosity Emma had ; and she made the most of it while her friend related .
Full of thanks , and full of news , Miss Bates knew not which to give quickest .
