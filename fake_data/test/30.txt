" Pray , Mr . Knightley ," said Emma , who had been smiling to herself through a great part of this speech , " how do you know that Mr . Martin did not speak yesterday ?"
not handsome -- not at all handsome .
You and Mr . Elton are by situation called together ; you belong to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes .
She could tell nothing of Hartfield , in which Mrs . Weston had not a lively concern ; and half an hour ' s uninterrupted communication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life depends , was one of the first gratifications of each .
Harriet would have been a better match .
But now I have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in January ."
" Emma ," said she , " this paper is worse than I expected .
They lived beyond their income , but still it was nothing in comparison of Enscombe : she did not cease to love her husband , but she wanted at once to be the wife of Captain Weston , and Miss Churchill of Enscombe .
Let us forgive each other at once .
Well , Mr . Knightley , and so you actually saw the letter ; well --"
How do you all do ?-- Quite well , I am much obliged to you .
" If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill , I have heard that already ."
The party did not break up without Emma ' s being positively secured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening , nor without her overhearing Mr . Weston whisper to his wife , " He has asked her , my dear .
I was quite surprized ;-- very glad , I am sure ; but really quite surprized .
He would soon be among them again ; Mr . Elton and his bride .
It was being very deficient ."
" Cautious , very cautious ," thought Emma ; " he advances inch by inch , and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure ."
" But it is never safe to sit out of doors , my dear ."
Will you chuse a wife for me ?-- I am sure I should like any body fixed on by you .
The weather added what it could of gloom .
" I do not know whether it ought to be so , but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way .
" I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him ."
That was all very true .
Emma was out of hearing .
It was kindly said , and very far from giving offence .
Had you witnessed my behaviour there , I can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well of me again .
No , my dear little modest Harriet , depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond - street till just before he mounts his horse to - morrow .
Elton .-- This letter tells us -- it is a short letter -- written in a hurry , merely to give us notice -- it tells us that they are all coming up to town directly , on Mrs . Churchill ' s account -- she has not been well the whole winter , and thinks Enscombe too cold for her -- so they are all to move southward without loss of time ."
She felt herself a most fortunate woman ; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought , where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled , and who could ill bear to part with her .
A man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her ."
Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived the former good old days of the room ?-- She who could do any thing in Highbury !
or a mermaid ?
no , no ;-- every feeling revolts .
_Now_ , he said , he was beginning to have no longer the same wish .
The character of Mrs . Churchill , the grief of her husband -- her mind glanced over them both with awe and compassion -- and then rested with lightened feelings on how Frank might be affected by the event , how benefited , how freed .
You cannot mean that he has even proposed to her again -- yet .
We had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all .
I cannot at all consent to Mr . Knightley ' s marrying ; and I am sure it is not at all likely .
Her own attachment had really subsided into a mere nothing ; it was not worth thinking of ;-- but if he , who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the two , were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he had taken away , it would be very distressing .
I am making a conundrum .
In all probability she was at this very time waited for there ; and Mr . Knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards Mr . Elton , if not towards William Larkins .
As you will do it , it will indeed , to use your own words , be an exquisite possession ."
She must not appear to think it a misfortune .-- With all the spirits she could command , she prepared him first for something strange , and then , in a few words , said , that if his consent and approbation could be obtained -- which , she trusted , would be attended with no difficulty , since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all -- she and Mr . Knightley meant to marry ; by which means Hartfield would receive the constant addition of that person ' s company whom she knew he loved , next to his daughters and Mrs . Weston , best in the world .
" Both sir !
The very day of Mr . Elton ' s going to London produced a fresh occasion for Emma ' s services towards her friend .
Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates to join us ?"
" You could not have visited me !"
He had still a small house in Highbury , where most of his leisure days were spent ; and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society , the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away .
" And I do envy him , Emma .
" You must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax should be allowed to come to you at such a time .
She knows now what gentlemen are ; and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance with Harriet ."
Harriet was silent .
" On this point we have been wretched .
Dixon ?"
I shall have no fears for you with him .
Do put up your horse at the Crown , and come in ."
asked Mr . Knightley .
This was very proper ; the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable ; but it should have lasted longer .
Of all the sources of evil surrounding the former , since her coming to Highbury , she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst .
Ah !
Miss Fairfax ' s recent illness had offered a fair plea for Mrs . Weston to invite her to an airing ; she had drawn back and declined at first , but , on being pressed had yielded ; and , in the course of their drive , Mrs . Weston had , by gentle encouragement , overcome so much of her embarrassment , as to bring her to converse on the important subject .
She checked herself , however , and submitted quietly to a little more praise than she deserved .
No , upon my honour , there is no unsteadiness of character .
And now , poor girl !
" I am going to Kingston .
I had no right to expect much , and I did not expect much ; but I had no idea that he could be so very clownish , so totally without air .
That is _ship_ ;-- plain as it can be .-- Now for the cream .
Emma was extremely glad to see him -- but there was a degree of confusion -- a number of embarrassing recollections on each side .
_You_ do not often overpower me with it ."
Unwelcome as it was , Mr . Woodhouse could only give a submissive sigh ; and as Emma saw his spirits affected by the idea of his daughter ' s attachment to her husband , she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them .
She wanted , rather , to be quiet , and out of temptation ; but still , as it was desirable that she should appear , in general , like her usual self , she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance , and enter as warmly into Mr . and Mrs . Weston ' s disappointment , as might naturally belong to their friendship .
" What was I talking of ?"
" If Mrs . Gilbert wishes to dance ," said he , " I shall have great pleasure , I am sure -- for , though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man , and that my dancing days are over , it would give me very great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs .
" You had better explore to Donwell ," replied Mr . Knightley .
At this moment they were approaching Ford ' s , and he hastily exclaimed , " Ha !
he told me all about it ; that Jane Fairfax and Mr . Frank Churchill are to be married , and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while .
He was wishing to confide in her -- perhaps to consult her ;-- cost her what it would , she would listen .
She was out ; and I felt it impossible not to wait till she came in .
" I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than Mr . Elton .
But take care of yourself .
" Very true .-- Well , a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again , late at night , and cold as the nights are now .
Full of thanks , and full of news , Miss Bates knew not which to give quickest .
I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , it is very delightful to me , to be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial to as Maple Grove .
He is so very superior .
She would not take a denial .
.
Within a fortnight .
Emma had not to listen to such paradings again -- to any so exclusively addressed to herself -- so disgustingly decorated with a " dear Miss Woodhouse ."
Its character as a ball - room caught him ; and instead of passing on , he stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed windows which were open , to look in and contemplate its capabilities , and lament that its original purpose should have ceased .
It is such a happiness when good people get together -- and they always do .
There will not be time for any thing ."
It seemed to him a very ill - judged measure ."
The want of proper families in the place , and the conviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted to attend , were mentioned ; but he was not satisfied .
" Very ."
It was her own universal good - will and contented temper which worked such wonders .
It was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was _not_ a fine lady ; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of it ;-- and she was considering in what way she had best retract , when Mr . Weston went on .
Her objections to Mr . Knightley ' s marrying did not in the least subside .
When one is in great pain , you know one cannot feel any blessing quite as it may deserve .
In this walk Emma and Mr . Weston found all the others assembled ; and towards this view she immediately perceived Mr . Knightley and Harriet distinct from the rest , quietly leading the way .
Nothing can stand more retired from the road than Maple Grove .
