" No more it is ."
" I can never think of it without laughing .-- She hears us , she hears us , Miss Woodhouse .
The extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or other ."
Before this time last year I assure you we had had a delightful exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston ."
But , as it is , the disappointment is single , and , I trust , will not be lasting .
" What is the matter now ?"
And now she was very conscious that she ought to have prevented them .-- She felt that she had been risking her friend ' s happiness on most insufficient grounds .
Mrs . Elton was first seen at church : but though devotion might be interrupted , curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew , and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid , to settle whether she were very pretty indeed , or only rather pretty , or not pretty at all .
" We shall never agree about him ," cried Emma ; " but that is nothing extraordinary .
She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith ' s conversation , but she found her altogether very engaging -- not inconveniently shy , not unwilling to talk -- and yet so far from pushing , shewing so proper and becoming a deference , seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to Hartfield , and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to , that she must have good sense , and deserve encouragement .
" Here have I ," said she , " actually talked poor Harriet into being very much attached to this man .
" Oh !
you will never guess .
" Certainly ; you must be sensible that the last half - year has made a great difference in your way of life ."
I am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with Mrs . Goddard .
Weston ."
" Having understood as much , I was rather astonished to find her so very lady - like !
Some people are surprized , I believe , that the eldest was not , but Isabella would have him called Henry , which I thought very pretty of her .
Miniatures , half - lengths , whole - lengths , pencil , crayon , and water - colours had been all tried in turn .
" And , upon my word , they have an air of great probability .
You must remember it now ?"
" He had just looked into the dining - room , and as he was not wanted there , preferred being out of doors ."
But , unfortunately -- in short , if your compassion does not stand my friend --"
" So scrupulous for others ," he continued , " and yet so careless for herself !
" Ah !
" I can never think of it ," she cried , " without extreme shame ."
Does not she , Jane ?-- Do not we often talk of Mr . Frank Churchill ?-- Ah !
" By the bye ," said Frank Churchill to Mrs . Weston presently , " what became of Mr . Perry ' s plan of setting up his carriage ?"
" There does , indeed , seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present ," said Mrs . Weston , " as can well be ; and while she is so happy at Hartfield , I cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor Mr . Woodhouse ' s account .
very well ," exclaimed Miss Bates , " then I need not be uneasy .
She believed he had been drinking too much of Mr . Weston ' s good wine , and felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense .
Knightley .-- They had determined that their marriage ought to be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield , to allow them the fortnight ' s absence in a tour to the seaside , which was the plan .-- John and Isabella , and every other friend , were agreed in approving it .
" I do pity you .
He positively said that it had been known to no being in the world but their two selves ."
He was quite delighted .
I knew he would !"
Harriet , she found , had never in her life been within side the Vicarage , and her curiosity to see it was so extreme , that , considering exteriors and probabilities , Emma could only class it , as a proof of love , with Mr . Elton ' s seeing ready wit in her .
Miss Woodhouse , what do you think has happened !"
Tell me how Miss Fairfax is ."
" I hope he does ," replied Mr . Knightley coolly , and resuming the letter .
The evening was quiet and conversable , as Mr . Woodhouse declined cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear Isabella , and the little party made two natural divisions ; on one side he and his daughter ; on the other the two Mr . Knightleys ; their subjects totally distinct , or very rarely mixing -- and Emma only occasionally joining in one or the other .
For Miss ----------, read Miss Smith .
My dear Emma , I am longing to talk to you .
This is precisely what I wanted .
This would be a trial .
you have found us out at last , have you , in our seclusion ?-- I was this moment telling Jane , I thought you would begin to be impatient for tidings of us ."
" But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired , papa ?"
She thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself , to have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her instead of his brother .
How the delicacy , the discretion of his favourite could have been so lain asleep !
Her mind was in a state of flutter and wonder , which made it impossible for her to be collected .
" This is very true ," said she , " at least as far as relates to me , which was all that was meant -- and it is very shameful .-- Of the same age -- and always knowing her -- I ought to have been more her friend .-- She will never like me now .
" I am disappointed ," was his only answer .
The young ladies of Highbury might have walked again in safety before their panic began , and the whole history dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to Emma and her nephews :-- in her imagination it maintained its ground , and Henry and John were still asking every day for the story of Harriet and the gipsies , and still tenaciously setting her right if she varied in the slightest particular from the original recital .
She then began to speak of you , and of the great kindness you had shewn her during her illness ; and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected , desired me , whenever I had an opportunity , to thank you -- I could not thank you too much -- for every wish and every endeavour to do her good .
" So obliged to you !-- so very much obliged to you for the carriage ," resumed Miss Bates .
To know that _she_ thought his coming certain was enough to make Emma consider it so , and sincerely did she rejoice in their joy .
" Mrs . Elton , I suppose , has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax owes --"
The ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant , " Men never know when things are dirty or not ;" and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to himself , " Women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares ."
Upon the whole , she was very persuadable ; and it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting his comfort -- how certainly Mrs . Goddard , if not Mrs . Bates , might be depended on for bearing him company -- Mr . Woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his daughter ' s going out to dinner on a day now near at hand , and spending the whole evening away from him .
Dinner was on table .-- Mrs .
" Not a walk in the rain , I should imagine ."
I always fetch the letters when I am here .
Harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory ; and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness , which at that moment would have been dreadful penance , by the sound of her father ' s footsteps .
" Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ ," said Frank Churchill , with a smile at Emma , " the person has not chosen ill .
" It is too much a matter of fact , but here it is .-- What two letters of the alphabet are there , that express perfection ?"
He had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle ; his horror of late hours , and large dinner - parties , made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms .
` I am sure you must be ,' said he , ` and I will send you another supply ; for I have a great many more than I can ever use .
You did not enjoy them as I did ; you appeared tired the whole time .
A man at his age -- what is he ?-- three or four - and - twenty -- cannot be without the means of doing as much as that .
I shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way ."
She was sensible of all the affection it evinced .
It cannot be long , I think , before she comes ."
But still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully Mr . Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse danced -- for doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with Jane Fairfax -- and even for simple dancing itself , without any of the wicked aids of vanity -- to assist him first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made to hold -- and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour , in the hope of discovering , in spite of all that Mr . Weston could say of their exactly equal size , that it was a little the largest .
But you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own .
However , I do really think Mr . Martin a very amiable young man , and have a great opinion of him ; and his being so much attached to me -- and his writing such a letter -- but as to leaving you , it is what I would not do upon any consideration ."
Jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour , and they had only accomplished some views of St . Mark ' s Place , Venice , when Frank Churchill entered the room .
" Oh !
There she was welcomed , with the utmost delight , by her father , who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage Lane -- turning a corner which he could never bear to think of -- and in strange hands -- a mere common coachman -- no James ; and there it seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well : for Mr . John Knightley , ashamed of his ill - humour , was now all kindness and attention ; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her father , as to seem -- if not quite ready to join him in a basin of gruel -- perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome ; and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party , except herself .-- But her mind had never been in such perturbation ; and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection .
Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me .
" But you may come again in the cool of to - morrow morning ."
" There is my news :-- I thought it would interest you ," said Mr . Knightley , with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of what had passed between them .
A sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded by her general state , had carried her off after a short struggle .
This , Harriet , is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us ."
With such sensations , Mr . Elton ' s civilities were dreadfully ill - timed ; but she had the comfort of appearing very polite , while feeling very cross -- and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again , or the substance of it , from the open - hearted Mr .
She would not marry , even if she were asked by Mr . Knightley .
It was some comfort to him that many inquiries after himself and Miss Woodhouse ( for his neighbours knew that he loved to be inquired after ), as well as Miss Smith , were coming in during the rest of the day ; and he had the pleasure of returning for answer , that they were all very indifferent -- which , though not exactly true , for she was perfectly well , and Harriet not much otherwise , Emma would not interfere with .
He is the very best young man -- But , my dear Jane , if you remember , I told you yesterday he was precisely the height of Mr . Perry .
While she talked of his son , Mr . Weston ' s attention was chained ; but when she got to Maple Grove , he could recollect that there were ladies just arriving to be attended to , and with happy smiles must hurry away .
" Aye , very true , my dear ," cried the latter , though Jane had not spoken a word --" I was just going to say the same thing .
She was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all apprehensive or embarrassed ; it was for him .
It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax , whose prospects were closing , while Harriet ' s opened , and whose engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury , who wished to shew her kindness -- and with Emma it was grown into a first wish .
Randalls is such a distance .
" I was only going to observe , that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women , I cannot imagine them to be very frequent .
He was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern .
" Come ," said he , " you are anxious for a compliment , so I will tell you that you have improved her .
" Mr . Wingfield most strenuously recommended it , sir -- or we should not have gone .
" And yet ," said Emma , beginning hastily and with an arch look , but soon stopping -- it was better , however , to know the worst at once -- she hurried on --" And yet , perhaps , you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is .
It was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was _not_ a fine lady ; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of it ;-- and she was considering in what way she had best retract , when Mr . Weston went on .
But " she could never get acquainted with her : she did not know how it was , but there was such coldness and reserve -- such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not -- and then , her aunt was such an eternal talker !-- and she was made such a fuss with by every body !-- and it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate -- because their ages were the same , every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other ."
