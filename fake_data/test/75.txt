I really am a most troublesome companion to you both , but I hope I am not often so ill - equipped .
asked Mrs .
Emma ' s project of forgetting Mr . Elton for a while made her rather sorry to find , when they had all taken their places , that he was close to her .
It was precisely what Emma would have wished , had she deemed it possible enough for wishing .
The evening was quiet and conversable , as Mr . Woodhouse declined cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear Isabella , and the little party made two natural divisions ; on one side he and his daughter ; on the other the two Mr . Knightleys ; their subjects totally distinct , or very rarely mixing -- and Emma only occasionally joining in one or the other .
Do not let me lose it .
They must keep as much together as they could ;" and James was talked to , and given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage .
" Yes ," said John Knightley , " and I think we shall have a good deal of it ."
She was sitting by Mr . Knightley , and turned to him for help .
Composure with a witness !
Emma knew that she had , but would not own it ; and Mr . Elton warmly added ,
Emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first .
And now she was very conscious that she ought to have prevented them .-- She felt that she had been risking her friend ' s happiness on most insufficient grounds .
Nobody thought of Hannah till you mentioned her -- James is so obliged to you !"
I love to look at her ; and I will add this praise , that I do not think her personally vain .
A circumstance rather unlucky occurred .
In all probability she was at this very time waited for there ; and Mr . Knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards Mr . Elton , if not towards William Larkins .
I always say a woman cannot have too many resources -- and I feel very thankful that I have so many myself as to be quite independent of society ."
You do not know how many candidates there always are for the _first_ situations .
Had she followed Mr . Knightley ' s known wishes , in paying that attention to Miss Fairfax , which was every way her due ; had she tried to know her better ; had she done her part towards intimacy ; had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith ; she must , in all probability , have been spared from every pain which pressed on her now .-- Birth , abilities , and education , had been equally marking one as an associate for her , to be received with gratitude ; and the other -- what was she ?-- Supposing even that they had never become intimate friends ; that she had never been admitted into Miss Fairfax ' s confidence on this important matter -- which was most probable -- still , in knowing her as she ought , and as she might , she must have been preserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr . Dixon , which she had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself , but had so unpardonably imparted ; an idea which she greatly feared had been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane ' s feelings , by the levity or carelessness of Frank Churchill ' s .
You will stay , and go with us ?"
It cannot be long , I think , before she comes ."
The scene enlarged ; two persons appeared ; Mrs . Weston and her son - in - law ; they were walking into Highbury ;-- to Hartfield of course .
The party was rather large , as it included one other family , a proper unobjectionable country family , whom the Coles had the advantage of naming among their acquaintance , and the male part of Mr . Cox ' s family , the lawyer of Highbury .
snows a little I see ."
It crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend ' s leaving Highbury , for the sake of her being settled so well .
But at last there seemed a perverse turn ; it seemed all at once as if he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account , than on Harriet ' s -- more anxious that she should escape the infection , than that there should be no infection in the complaint .
" Upon my word it is , Miss Bates .-- He really is engaged from morning to night .-- There is no end of people ' s coming to him , on some pretence or other .-- The magistrates , and overseers , and churchwardens , are always wanting his opinion .
" And make her like myself ."
A little curiosity Emma had ; and she made the most of it while her friend related .
Mr . Knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to express ; and before he could make any reply , Mr . Woodhouse , whose thoughts were on the Bates ' s , said --
" If a woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself , it is in a situation like Jane Fairfax ' s .-- Of such , one may almost say , that ` the world is not their ' s , nor the world ' s law .'"
But I can remember nothing ;-- not even that particular riddle which you have heard me mention ; I can only recollect the first stanza ; and there are several .
Another accidental meeting with the Martins was possible , and in her present state , would be dangerous .
" Yes , my dear , if there is time .-- But --( in a very depressed tone )-- she is coming for only one week .
The event acquitted her of all the fancifulness , and all the selfishness of imaginary complaints .
there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to South End .
Mr . Knightley ' s eyes had preceded Miss Bates ' s in a glance at Jane .
" We had better move on , Mr . Weston ," said she , " we are detaining the girls ."
He is the very best young man -- But , my dear Jane , if you remember , I told you yesterday he was precisely the height of Mr . Perry .
no , upon my word I have not the smallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body .
" Pretty !
-- ` I can see nobody ,' said she ; and up she got , and would go away ; and that was what made us keep you waiting -- and extremely sorry and ashamed we were .
The persons to be invited , required little thought .
Harriet , tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word , was always very long at a purchase ; and while she was still hanging over muslins and changing her mind , Emma went to the door for amusement .-- Much could not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of Highbury ;-- Mr . Perry walking hastily by , Mr . William Cox letting himself in at the office - door , Mr . Cole ' s carriage - horses returning from exercise , or a stray letter - boy on an obstinate mule , were the liveliest objects she could presume to expect ; and when her eyes fell only on the butcher with his tray , a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full basket , two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone , and a string of dawdling children round the baker ' s little bow - window eyeing the gingerbread , she knew she had no reason to complain , and was amused enough ; quite enough still to stand at the door .
" News !
" Difference !
Oh , no !
Command yourself enough to say no more , and I will endeavour to forget it ."
" Mr . Knightley I declare !-- I must speak to him if possible , just to thank him .
But yet I think there was something wanting .
What are they saying about Mr .
In the gayest and happiest spirits she set forward with her father ; not always listening , but always agreeing to what he said ; and , whether in speech or silence , conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his being obliged to go to Randalls every day , or poor Mrs . Weston would be disappointed .
Upon such occasions poor Mr . Woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare .
" A straightforward , open - hearted man like Weston , and a rational , unaffected woman like Miss Taylor , may be safely left to manage their own concerns .
Granted ;-- for private enjoyment ; and for private enjoyment keep them .
" Oh !"
" I was going to observe , sir ," said Frank Churchill , " that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any body ' s catching cold -- so much less danger at the Crown than at Randalls !
The advantage of the match I felt to be all on her side ; and had not the smallest doubt ( nor have I now ) that there would be a general cry - out upon her extreme good luck .
Stokes .-- Every body invited , was certainly to come ; Frank had already written to Enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight , which could not possibly be refused .
" My dear Miss Woodhouse , a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act .
Upon the whole , she was very persuadable ; and it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting his comfort -- how certainly Mrs . Goddard , if not Mrs . Bates , might be depended on for bearing him company -- Mr . Woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his daughter ' s going out to dinner on a day now near at hand , and spending the whole evening away from him .
She could never see a fault in any of them .
The anxious cares , the incessant attentions of Mrs . Weston , were not thrown away .
You , who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on these subjects , who must have been so deep in the business on Miss Campbell ' s account -- we shall not excuse your being indifferent about Mr . Elton and Miss Hawkins ."
The strength of the song falls on the second ."
He left me not half an hour ago ."
So obliged to you for the carriage last night .
She longed for the serenity they might gradually introduce ; and on Mr . Perry ' s coming in soon after dinner , with a disengaged hour to give her father , she lost no time ill hurrying into the shrubbery .-- There , with spirits freshened , and thoughts a little relieved , she had taken a few turns , when she saw Mr . Knightley passing through the garden door , and coming towards her .-- It was the first intimation of his being returned from London .
I have not an idea -- I cannot guess it in the least .
He turned to Mrs . Weston to implore her assistance , " Would not she give him her support ?-- would not she add her persuasions to his , to induce Miss Woodhouse not to go to Mrs . Goddard ' s till it were certain that Miss Smith ' s disorder had no infection ?
Knightley ' s words dwelt with her .
And Jane will have such another .
" You have some news to hear , now you are come back , that will rather surprize you ."
Kitty , a fair but frozen maid .
" My dear Jane , what is this I hear ?-- Going to the post - office in the rain !-- This must not be , I assure you .-- You sad girl , how could you do such a thing ?-- It is a sign I was not there to take care of you ."
Leave shame to her .
One cannot wonder , one cannot wonder .
Tell me how Miss Fairfax is ."
" Oh !
Gratifying , however , and stimulative as was the letter in the material part , its sentiments , she yet found , when it was folded up and returned to Mrs . Weston , that it had not added any lasting warmth , that she could still do without the writer , and that he must learn to do without her .
I am always watching her to admire ; and I do pity her from my heart ."
Then the baked apples came home , Mrs . Wallis sent them by her boy ; they are extremely civil and obliging to us , the Wallises , always -- I have heard some people say that Mrs . Wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer , but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention from them .
It was his idea to bring her to Hartfield : he had thought of no other place .
" That fellow ," said he , indignantly , " thinks of nothing but shewing off his own voice .
Oh !
If I had but her memory !
Not that I think Mr . Martin would ever marry any body but what had had some education -- and been very well brought up .
" You surprize me !
The want of proper families in the place , and the conviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted to attend , were mentioned ; but he was not satisfied .
Miss Woodhouse was so great a personage in Highbury , that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure ; but the humble , grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings , delighted with the affability with which Miss Woodhouse had treated her all the evening , and actually shaken hands with her at last !
You may have done wrong with regard to Mr . Dixon , but this is a punishment beyond what you can have merited !-- The kindness and protection of Mrs .
There could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her .
It is a necessary of life to me ; and having always been used to a very musical society , both at Maple Grove and in Bath , it would have been a most serious sacrifice .
CHAPTER IX
Miss Nash had been telling her something , which she repeated immediately with great delight .
Isabella then went to Emma ; but Emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away ; and they were still discussing the point , when Mr . Knightley , who had left the room immediately after his brother ' s first report of the snow , came back again , and told them that he had been out of doors to examine , and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty in their getting home , whenever they liked it , either now or an hour hence .
replied Emma , unable to guess , by look or voice , whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint .
She had not advanced many yards from Mrs . Goddard ' s door , when she was met by Mr . Elton himself , evidently coming towards it , and as they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid -- of whom he , on the rumour of considerable illness , had been going to inquire , that he might carry some report of her to Hartfield -- they were overtaken by Mr . John Knightley returning from the daily visit to Donwell , with his two eldest boys , whose healthy , glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run , and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for .
She introduced him to her friend , Miss Smith , and , at convenient moments afterwards , heard what each thought of the other .
