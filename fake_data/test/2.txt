After much thinking , she could determine on nothing better , than Harriet ' s returning the visit ; but in a way that , if they had understanding , should convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance .
Pray come in ; do come in .
Harriet ' s claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them .
Weston and Cole will be there too ; but one is apt to speak only of those who lead .-- I fancy Mr . E . and Knightley have every thing their own way ."
There was one , however , which Emma thought something of .-- The two last dances before supper were begun , and Harriet had no partner ;-- the only young lady sitting down ;-- and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers , that how there could be any one disengaged was the wonder !-- But Emma ' s wonder lessened soon afterwards , on seeing Mr . Elton sauntering about .
She could not bear that her master should not be able to have another apple - tart this spring .
Dixon ?"
" We should not like her so well as we do , sir , if we could suppose it ; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor ' s advantage ; she knows how very acceptable it must be , at Miss Taylor ' s time of life , to be settled in a home of her own , and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision , and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure .
cried Harriet , colouring , and astonished .
Now , if your friends have any gratitude , they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return ; but I cannot stay to hear it ."
With respect to her father , it was a question soon answered .
But sometimes of an evening , before we went to cards , he would read something aloud out of the Elegant Extracts , very entertaining .
It was the delay of a great deal of pleasure and parade .
" It is impossible for me to doubt any longer .
Any other situation would have been much less in character .
She questioned him as to the society in Yorkshire -- the extent of the neighbourhood about Enscombe , and the sort ; and could make out from his answers that , as far as Enscombe was concerned , there was very little going on , that their visitings were among a range of great families , none very near ; and that even when days were fixed , and invitations accepted , it was an even chance that Mrs . Churchill were not in health and spirits for going ; that they made a point of visiting no fresh person ; and that , though he had his separate engagements , it was not without difficulty , without considerable address _at_ _times_ , that he could get away , or introduce an acquaintance for a night .
He had frightened her a little about Mr . Elton ; but when she considered that Mr . Knightley could not have observed him as she had done , neither with the interest , nor ( she must be allowed to tell herself , in spite of Mr . Knightley ' s pretensions ) with the skill of such an observer on such a question as herself , that he had spoken it hastily and in anger , she was able to believe , that he had rather said what he wished resentfully to be true , than what he knew any thing about .
What a letter the man writes !"
They seemed more like cheerful , easy friends , than lovers .
If you remember any queernesses , set them all to the right account .-- Of the pianoforte so much talked of , I feel it only necessary to say , that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F --, who would never have allowed me to send it , had any choice been given her .-- The delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement , my dear madam , is much beyond my power of doing justice to .
His aunt could not bear to have him leave her .
She seemed bent on giving no real insight into Mr . Dixon ' s character , or her own value for his company , or opinion of the suitableness of the match .
Where is it ?
Every body last night said how well you played ."
Now they seemed in pleasant conversation .
It was Miss Taylor ' s loss which first brought grief .
there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to South End .
I doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it ."
" I declare , I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction !-- It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax , who plays so delightfully , should not have an instrument .
Do you mean with regard to this letter ?"
Donwell was famous for its strawberry - beds , which seemed a plea for the invitation : but no plea was necessary ; cabbage - beds would have been enough to tempt the lady , who only wanted to be going somewhere .
Do as you please ."
The longer she considered it , the greater was her sense of its expediency .
Knightley !-- Mr .
_We_ must begin ; we must go and pay wedding visit very soon ."
Other poultry - yards in the neighbourhood also suffered .-- Pilfering was _housebreaking_ to Mr . Woodhouse ' s fears .-- He was very uneasy ; and but for the sense of his son - in - law ' s protection , would have been under wretched alarm every night of his life .
" Depend upon me -- but ask no more questions .
CHAPTER IX
She had been often remiss , her conscience told her so ; remiss , perhaps , more in thought than fact ; scornful , ungracious .
He stopped in his earnestness to look the question , and the expression of his eyes overpowered her .
It was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character which I knew her to possess ; and the secrecy she had maintained , as to any such design in her former letter , was equally descriptive of its anxious delicacy .
I remember it perfectly .
He will connect himself well if he can ."
The carriage -- we had disappointments about the carriage ;-- one morning , I remember , he came to me quite in despair ."
With a faint blush , she presently replied ,
From perfect misery to perfect happiness !"
" Poor comfort !"
" There it is .
But -- that he should talk of encouragement , should consider her as aware of his views , accepting his attentions , meaning ( in short ), to marry him !-- should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind !-- look down upon her friend , so well understanding the gradations of rank below him , and be so blind to what rose above , as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her !-- It was most provoking .
Richard ?-- I saw you the other day as you rode through the town -- Mrs . Otway , I protest !-- and good Mr . Otway , and Miss Otway and Miss Caroline .-- Such a host of friends !-- and Mr . George and Mr .
He had been thinking it over most deeply , most intently ; he had at first hoped to induce Mr . Woodhouse to remove with her to Donwell ; he had wanted to believe it feasible , but his knowledge of Mr . Woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself long ; and now he confessed his persuasion , that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father ' s comfort , perhaps even of his life , which must not be hazarded .
She had led her friend astray , and it would be a reproach to her for ever ; but her judgment was as strong as her feelings , and as strong as it had ever been before , in reprobating any such alliance for him , as most unequal and degrading .
She had given them neither men , nor names , nor places , that could raise a blush .
" Quite out of the question , quite out of the question ," he replied ;-- " but you must often wish it , I am sure ."
Miss Bates should never again -- no , never !
My mother desires her very best compliments and regards , and a thousand thanks , and says you really quite oppress her ."
She could then see more and judge better .
She was told that now he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them , almost as often as he could even wish .
I hope he will not mind it so very much ."
It would be almost beginning their life of civility again .
A few minutes made Emma acquainted with the whole .
I doubt it .
Oh !
` Have you , upon your honour ?'
She never mentioned it before , because she would not alarm us .
Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me .
To her it was real enjoyment to be with the Westons .
" It is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion ," said Mr . Knightley .
You cannot be ignorant , Mrs . Elton , of my connexion with the family , nor of the treatment I have met with ; and , between ourselves , the whole blame of it is to be laid to her .
" And when she had come away , Mrs . Martin was so very kind as to send Mrs . Goddard a beautiful goose -- the finest goose Mrs . Goddard had ever seen .
I doubt whether he will return the compliment , and discover her to be a lady .
" The clerks grow expert from habit .-- They must begin with some quickness of sight and hand , and exercise improves them .
Upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated .
We were always glad to see him at Hartfield ."
My mother often talks of your good - nature .
" My dear sir , do not make a stranger of me ."
She hardly knew yet what Mr . Knightley would ask ; but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution of never quitting her father .-- She even wept over the idea of it , as a sin of thought .
Frank turned instantly to Emma , to claim her former promise ; and boasted himself an engaged man , which his father looked his most perfect approbation of -- and it then appeared that Mrs . Weston was wanting _him_ to dance with Mrs . Elton himself , and that their business was to help to persuade him into it , which was done pretty soon .-- Mr . Weston and Mrs . Elton led the way , Mr . Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed .
" Mr . Elton going to be married !"
I should like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the party ; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys .
no , no ;-- every feeling revolts .
Had you not been surrounded by other friends , I might have been tempted to introduce a subject , to ask questions , to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct .-- I feel that I should certainly have been impertinent ."
I do not see it ."
Dear Emma has been to call on Mrs . and Miss Bates , Mr . Knightley , as I told you before .
May was better for every thing than February .
" I am sorry to find , my love , that my father does not think you looking well -- but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued .
Believe me , sir , I am far , very far , from gratified in being the object of such professions ."
Knightley .'
no -- I never conceived you could become indifferent .
They spoke , therefore , of Mrs . Churchill ' s death with mutual forbearance .
He paused a moment , again smiling , with his eyes fixed on her face .
There were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by the window .
She believed she had been foolish , but it had alarmed her , and she had been within half a minute of sending for Mr . Perry .
Miss Churchill , however , being of age , and with the full command of her fortune -- though her fortune bore no proportion to the family - estate -- was not to be dissuaded from the marriage , and it took place , to the infinite mortification of Mr . and Mrs . Churchill , who threw her off with due decorum .
A thousand vexatious thoughts would recur .
Pray come in ; do come in .
" Why , to own the truth , I am afraid you are rather thrown away , and that with every disposition to bear , there will be nothing to be borne .
" Mrs . Churchill is not much in my good graces , as you may suspect -- but this is quite between ourselves .
Miss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour ; and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself , or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect .
Vanity working on a weak head , produces every sort of mischief .
