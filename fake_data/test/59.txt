I am sure of having their opinions with me ."
Emma liked the subject so well , that she began upon it , to Mrs . Weston , very soon after their moving into the drawing - room : wishing her joy -- yet observing , that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming .-- Mrs . Weston agreed to it ; but added , that she should be very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked of : " for I cannot depend upon his coming .
" They would have solicited the honour earlier , but had been waiting the arrival of a folding - screen from London , which they hoped might keep Mr . Woodhouse from any draught of air , and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour of his company ."
I beg your pardon , sir .
I have done very little ."
My dear Emma , your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came to the point ."
He would be always coming over .
" I am afraid Jane is not very well ," said she , " but I do not know ; they _tell_ me she is well .
Approve my charade and my intentions in the same glance .'
said Mrs . John Knightley .-- " It is so long since I have seen her , except now and then for a moment accidentally in town !
Emma ' s comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on , by Harriet ' s being to stay longer ; her fortnight was likely to be a month at least .
Mr . Woodhouse agreed to it all , but added ,
You may guess how readily he came into my wishes ; and having his approbation , I made my way directly to Miss Bates , to assure her that the carriage would be at her service before it took us home ; for I thought it would be making her comfortable at once .
Weston ."
" But , my dear papa , you are no friend to matrimony ; and therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _bride_ ?
" Jane caught a bad cold , poor thing !
" Thank you for rousing me ," he replied .
Were she your equal in situation -- but , Emma , consider how far this is from being the case .
.
Mr . Weston , I could not have believed it of you !"
" Are you well , my Emma ?"
--
When the time proposed drew near , Mrs . Weston ' s fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse .
To be sure , the charade , with its " ready wit "-- but then the " soft eyes "-- in fact it suited neither ; it was a jumble without taste or truth .
He thought principally of Mrs . Churchill ' s illness , and wanted to know how she was treated ; and as for the ball , it was shocking to have dear Emma disappointed ; but they would all be safer at home .
That was the kind action ; that was the noble benevolence and generosity ; that was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every other being upon earth ."
" News !
" I can never think of it without laughing .-- She hears us , she hears us , Miss Woodhouse .
We must look to her one fault , and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement , to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment ."
The strength of the song falls on the second ."
" I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years ' experience , and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child .
" Oh !
Perry does not call it altogether a sickly season ."
I wish you could have heard how she talked of it -- with what candour and generosity .
" She has taken it into her head that Enscombe is too cold for her .
" She could not compose herself -- Mr . Woodhouse would be alarmed -- she had better go ;"-- with most ready encouragement from her friend , therefore , she passed off through another door -- and the moment she was gone , this was the spontaneous burst of Emma ' s feelings : " Oh God !
" I assure you she did .
I hope he will be calling soon .
" How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this occasion , Miss Fairfax .
No more is Emma .
" No great variety of faces for you ," said Emma .
My mother says the orchard was always famous in her younger days .
" Thank you , dear Miss Woodhouse , you are all kindness .-- It is impossible to say -- Yes , indeed , I quite understand -- dearest Jane ' s prospects -- that is , I do not mean .-- But she is charmingly recovered .-- How is Mr .
and it will not be very long , I hope , before that becomes the acknowledgment of more than your reason .-- Fortunate that your affections were not farther entangled !-- I could never , I confess , from your manners , assure myself as to the degree of what you felt -- I could only be certain that there was a preference -- and a preference which I never believed him to deserve .-- He is a disgrace to the name of man .-- And is he to be rewarded with that sweet young woman ?-- Jane , Jane , you will be a miserable creature ."
" She would rather not be in his company more than she could help .
Emma found it really time to be at home ; the visit had already lasted long ; and on examining watches , so much of the morning was perceived to be gone , that Mrs . Weston and her companion taking leave also , could allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to Hartfield gates , before they set off for Randalls .
" And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain .
You do not know what it is to have tempers to manage ."
" Will you read the letter ?"
For Miss ----------, read Miss Smith .
" Will you ?"
Her feelings altered towards Emma .-- Offended , probably , by the little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with , she drew back in her turn and gradually became much more cold and distant ; and though the effect was agreeable , the ill - will which produced it was necessarily increasing Emma ' s dislike .
You do not know what it is to have tempers to manage ."
Emma made no answer , and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned , but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone .
so silly -- so satisfied -- so smiling -- so prosing -- so undistinguishing and unfastidious -- and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me , I would marry to - morrow .
He had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her some walnuts , because she had said how fond she was of them , and in every thing else he was so very obliging .
At present , I ask only to hear , once to hear your voice ."
I have often talked to her a good deal .
He gave her a letter , it was from Frank , and to herself ; he had met with it in his way , and had taken the liberty of opening it .
They walked on .
You will not like the noise ."
Poor Mr . Woodhouse trembled as he sat , and , as Emma had foreseen , would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again .
Mrs . Goddard was the mistress of a School -- not of a seminary , or an establishment , or any thing which professed , in long sentences of refined nonsense , to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality , upon new principles and new systems -- and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity -- but a real , honest , old - fashioned Boarding - school , where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price , and where girls might be sent to be out of the way , and scramble themselves into a little education , without any danger of coming back prodigies .
but those two lines are "--
They , in their different homes , and their different ways , might be looking back on it with pleasure ; but in her view it was a morning more completely misspent , more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time , and more to be abhorred in recollection , than any she had ever passed .
But Harriet rejected the suspicion with spirit .
Mr . Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser , and she knew Mr . Elton looked up to him .
There was intimacy between them , and Mr . Cole had heard from Mr . Elton since his going away .
" Who is that gentleman on horseback ?"
" What a comfort it is , that we think alike about our nephews and nieces .
This was the conclusion of the first series of reflection .
said Mr . Woodhouse , always the last to make his way in conversation ; " then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady .
"` Smallridge !'
Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own !
Nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high .
The beginning , however , of every visit displayed none but the properest feelings , and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality .
just the trifling , silly fellow I took him for ."
He talked of Harriet , and praised her so warmly , that she could not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add .
Think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy ; and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it , and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of Mr . Knightley ' s marrying Jane Fairfax , or any body else , which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt .
He listened in perfect silence .
" What a very great pleasure it will be to you !
certainly not too tall ; not in the least too tall .
" When you have seen more of this country , I am afraid you will think you have overrated Hartfield .
They had been arrived only a few minutes , and Mr . Weston had scarcely finished his explanation of Frank ' s being a day before his time , and her father was yet in the midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations , when she appeared , to have her share of surprize , introduction , and pleasure .
" There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than you used to be .
I knew he would !"
They now walked on together quietly , till within view of the vicarage pales , when a sudden resolution , of at least getting Harriet into the house , made her again find something very much amiss about her boot , and fall behind to arrange it once more .
Mr . Elton cared little about it , compared with his wife ; he only hoped " the young lady ' s pride would now be contented ;" and supposed " she had always meant to catch Knightley if she could ;" and , on the point of living at Hartfield , could daringly exclaim , " Rather he than I !"
We must go in the carriage , to be sure ."
Nobody could be so imprudent !
" He is very obliging ," said Emma ; " but is he sure that Harriet means to marry him ?"
It was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits .
" One ought to use the same caution , perhaps , in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family ; but Enscombe , I believe , certainly must not be judged by general rules : _she_ is so very unreasonable ; and every thing gives way to her ."
She was warmly gratified -- and in another moment still more so , by a little movement of more than common friendliness on his part .-- He took her hand ;-- whether she had not herself made the first motion , she could not say -- she might , perhaps , have rather offered it -- but he took her hand , pressed it , and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips -- when , from some fancy or other , he suddenly let it go .-- Why he should feel such a scruple , why he should change his mind when it was all but done , she could not perceive .-- He would have judged better , she thought , if he had not stopped .-- The intention , however , was indubitable ; and whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry , or however else it happened , but she thought nothing became him more .-- It was with him , of so simple , yet so dignified a nature .-- She could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction .
The older a person grows , Harriet , the more important it is that their manners should not be bad ; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness , or coarseness , or awkwardness becomes .
They were a couple worth looking at .
His own stomach could bear nothing rich , and he could never believe other people to be different from himself .
Absolutely insufferable !
Every thing tender and charming was to mark their parting ; but still they were to part .
Look at my shoes .
