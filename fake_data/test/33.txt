Emma was most happy to be called to such a council ; and her father , engaging to think it all over while she was gone , the two young people set off together without delay for the Crown .
They are some of my very old friends .
The quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for Mr . Woodhouse , who had often been distressed by the more animated sort , which Mr . Weston had occasionally introduced , and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting , with tender melancholy , over the departure of the " poor little boys ," or in fondly pointing out , as he took up any stray letter near him , how beautifully Emma had written it .
I was fatigued .
He understood what would be welcome ; he could be sure of little else .
At first it was downright dulness to Emma .
But I am quite in the minority , I believe ; few people seem to value simplicity of dress ,-- show and finery are every thing .
Knightley !-- never seen him in her life before , and call him Knightley !-- and discover that he is a gentleman !
" Knightley !"
It did not often happen ; for Mr . John Knightley had really a great regard for his father - in - law , and generally a strong sense of what was due to him ; but it was too often for Emma ' s charity , especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured , though the offence came not .
The service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart ."
Poor Mr . Elton !
At Hartfield , you have had very good specimens of well educated , well bred men .
Mr . Woodhouse hesitated .--" Not near so often , my dear , as I could wish ."
Elton was sitting here , I remember , much about where I am now ."
this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of their lives , as my father informs me .
They seemed to be within half a sentence of Harriet , and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject , if possible .
It is a beautiful moonlight night ; and so mild that I must draw back from your great fire ."
I am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with Mrs . Goddard .
She spoke with great agitation ; and Emma very feelingly replied , " That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now .
A Miss Hawkins --"
perfectly .
Jane was forced to smile completely , for a moment ; and the smile partly remained as she turned towards him , and said in a conscious , low , yet steady voice ,
Elton !-- no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him ."
" My friend Mr . Perry !
She had never rejoiced at the sound before , nor ever before entered the passage , nor walked up the stairs , with any wish of giving pleasure , but in conferring obligation , or of deriving it , except in subsequent ridicule .
Do you mean with regard to this letter ?"
I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can , I must walk somewhere , and the post - office is an object ; and upon my word , I have scarcely ever had a bad morning before ."
" As to that -- I do not --"
He knows the value of a good income as well as any body .
" Your word !-- why not your honour !-- why not say upon your honour , that it has nothing to do with any of them ?
.
In the daily interchange of news , they must be again restricted to the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings ' coming had been united , such as the last accounts of Mrs . Churchill , whose health seemed every day to supply a different report , and the situation of Mrs . Weston , whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child , as that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it .
My blindness to what was going on , led me to act by them in a way that I must always be ashamed of , and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures , but I have no other reason to regret that I was not in the secret earlier ."
I dare say Miss Nash would envy you such an opportunity as this of being married .
But you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield .
" No , indeed -- _we_ are not at all in a bad air .
" I dare say she had ."
" The carriage !
" Oh !
A little while ago , every letter to Isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties ; dinners at Mr . Cole ' s , or balls at the Crown .
" A material difference then ," she replied --" and no doubt you were much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives ; but does not the lapse of one - and - twenty years bring our understandings a good deal nearer ?"
This wretched note was the finale of Emma ' s breakfast .
I should be as ready to acknowledge his merits as any other man ; but I hear of none , except what are merely personal ; that he is well - grown and good - looking , with smooth , plausible manners ."
Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin ?
I will keep my ill - humour to myself .
" But I ," he soon added , " who have had no such charm thrown over my senses , must still see , hear , and remember .
a word to the wise .-- I am in a fine flow of spirits , an ' t I ?
They ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through the winter .
Not that I think Mr . Martin would ever marry any body but what had had some education -- and been very well brought up .
Knightley .'
The loss of the ball -- the loss of the young man -- and all that the young man might be feeling !-- It was too wretched !-- Such a delightful evening as it would have been !-- Every body so happy !
She had heard and seen it all ; and felt some curiosity to know whether the wet walk of this morning had produced any .
Miss Fairfax , I dare say , would not have me if I were to ask her -- and I am very sure I shall never ask her ."
" Indeed , Harriet , it would have been a severe pang to lose you ; but it must have been .
.
One morning , about ten days after Mrs . Churchill ' s decease , Emma was called downstairs to Mr . Weston , who " could not stay five minutes , and wanted particularly to speak with her ."
Mrs . John Knightley was a pretty , elegant little woman , of gentle , quiet manners , and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate ; wrapt up in her family ; a devoted wife , a doating mother , and so tenderly attached to her father and sister that , but for these higher ties , a warmer love might have seemed impossible .
I had no right to expect much , and I did not expect much ; but I had no idea that he could be so very clownish , so totally without air .
" Does nothing occur to you ?-- Do not you recollect ?-- Harriet Smith ."
A line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance ; and my particular friend , Mrs . Partridge , the lady I have always resided with when in Bath , would be most happy to shew you any attentions , and would be the very person for you to go into public with ."
I am sure they will bring him soon ."
I think there is a little likeness between us ."
I Always take the part of my own sex .
But I do not like the corner into Vicarage Lane ."
I was sitting near the door -- Elizabeth saw me directly ; but he did not ; he was busy with the umbrella .
Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home , and thought this the best offer she was likely to have ."
Exactly so indeed !"
he cried , " I wish your father might be half as easily convinced as John will be , of our having every right that equal worth can give , to be happy together .
I do not believe I did you any good .
He had been too much expected by the best judges , for surprize -- but there was great joy .
" Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day , out of so few , in having your hair cut ."
no .
" I know you , I know you ; you would take up with any thing ; but I shall be a little more nice , and I am sure the good Campbells will be quite on my side ; with your superior talents , you have a right to move in the first circle .
This event had very lately taken place ; too lately for any thing to be yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path of duty ; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had fixed on for beginning .
Emma was most sincerely interested .
" But it is never safe to sit out of doors , my dear ."
He had never been an unhappy man ; his own temper had secured him from that , even in his first marriage ; but his second must shew him how delightful a well - judging and truly amiable woman could be , and must give him the pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen , to excite gratitude than to feel it .
Harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion .
Harriet was one of those , who , having once begun , would be always in love .
And then fly off , through half a sentence , to her mother ' s old petticoat .
She had half a mind to resent ; but an instant ' s observation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings , and not meant to provoke ; and therefore she let it pass .
-- was a question , however , which did not augur much .
Matrimony , as the origin of change , was always disagreeable ; and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter ' s marrying , nor could ever speak of her but with compassion , though it had been entirely a match of affection , when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too ; and from his habits of gentle selfishness , and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself , he was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them , and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield .
But with all the hopes of cheerfulness , and all the present comfort of delay , there was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with Harriet , as made it impossible for Emma to be ever perfectly at ease .
Heaven forbid !
John Knightley only was in mute astonishment .-- That a man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a day of business in London , should set off again , and walk half a mile to another man ' s house , for the sake of being in mixed company till bed - time , of finishing his day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers , was a circumstance to strike him deeply .
She could not respect his eye , but his love and his complaisance were unexceptionable .
Have you heard the news ?
Frank ' s was the first idea ; and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it ; for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties , and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance .
The danger would have been of my wearying you .
But she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks before it appeared , that when the insult came at last , it found her very differently affected .
" The ladies were all at home ."
However , I think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again .
And it was spoken with a sort of sighing animation , which had a vast deal of the lover .
I do not think it could disagree with you ."
CHAPTER VII
it is no difficulty to see who you take after !
" Oh !
Gilbert would have danced the other evening , if she had been asked .
