He was gone immediately ; and Emma soon saw him standing before Miss Fairfax , and talking to her ; but as to its effect on the young lady , as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them , exactly in front of Miss Fairfax , she could absolutely distinguish nothing .
An express arrived at Randalls to announce the death of Mrs . Churchill !
He appeared to have a very open temper -- certainly a very cheerful and lively one ; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions , a great deal decidedly right ; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard , was fond of talking of him -- said he would be the best man in the world if he were left to himself ; and though there was no being attached to the aunt , he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude , and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect .
What nonsense one talks , Miss Woodhouse , when hard at work , if one talks at all ;-- your real workmen , I suppose , hold their tongues ; but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word -- Miss Fairfax said something about conjecturing .
I have a very strong notion that it comes from him .
Poor Mr . Woodhouse trembled as he sat , and , as Emma had foreseen , would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again .
He only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself ; and if Miss Woodhouse of Hartfield , the heiress of thirty thousand pounds , were not quite so easily obtained as he had fancied , he would soon try for Miss Somebody else with twenty , or with ten .
Harriet was silent .
It would be a disappointment to my father -- and altogether -- I do not know that -- I am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well ."
Her face was averted from those who had made the attack , and turned towards her aunt .
Maple Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be -- for we do not at all affect to equal my brother , Mr . Suckling , in income .-- However , my resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax .-- I shall certainly have her very often at my house , shall introduce her wherever I can , shall have musical parties to draw out her talents , and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation .
Not to wait upon a bride is very remiss .
I do not consider myself at all a fortunate person ."
" I mentioned no _names_ , you will observe .-- Oh !
Dear me , how clever !-- Could it really be meant for me ?"
And no apology left , no message for me .
We must look to her one fault , and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement , to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment ."
I hope you are quite well .
Emma looked graciously .
.
it is no difficulty to see who you take after !
How do you do , Mr .
Pray excuse me ; but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy , it cannot be expected that Emma , accountable to nobody but her father , who perfectly approves the acquaintance , should put an end to it , so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself .
And ( raising his voice still more ) I do not see why Miss Fairfax should not be mentioned too .
He had received a good education , but , on succeeding early in life to a small independence , had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged , and had satisfied an active , cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of his county , then embodied .
" Oh !
She appeared to me to play well , that is , with considerable taste , but I know nothing of the matter myself .-- I am excessively fond of music , but without the smallest skill or right of judging of any body ' s performance .-- I have been used to hear her ' s admired ; and I remember one proof of her being thought to play well :-- a man , a very musical man , and in love with another woman -- engaged to her -- on the point of marriage -- would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument , if the lady in question could sit down instead -- never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other .
Let us make the best of it -- and , indeed , almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour .
" I have some hope ," resumed he , " of my uncle ' s being persuaded to pay a visit at Randalls ; he wants to be introduced to her .
CHAPTER II
Emma soon recollected , and understood him ; and while she joined in the laugh , it was evident from Jane ' s countenance that she too was really hearing him , though trying to seem deaf .
I think your manners to him encouraging .
I have seen you only as the admirer of my friend .
The pleasure is not enhanced , and the inconvenience is often considerable .
They must be separated ; but there was a great deal of pain in the process -- so much to herself at this time , that she soon felt the necessity of a little consolation , and resolved on going home by way of Randalls to procure it .
Emma knew that she had , but would not own it ; and Mr . Elton warmly added ,
She did most heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhood -- and sat down and practised vigorously an hour and a half .
She had hoped for an answer here -- for a few words to say that her conduct was at least intelligible ; but he was silent ; and , as far as she could judge , deep in thought .
Your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave England ."
But you know what I am .-- You hear nothing but truth from me .-- I have blamed you , and lectured you , and you have borne it as no other woman in England would have borne it .-- Bear with the truths I would tell you now , dearest Emma , as well as you have borne with them .
This she had been prepared for when she entered the house ; but meant , having once talked him handsomely over , to be no farther incommoded by any troublesome topic , and to wander at large amongst all the Mistresses and Misses of Highbury , and their card - parties .
My dear , did you change your stockings ?"
I hope she is right .-- In one respect , my good fortune is undoubted , that of being able to subscribe myself , Your obliged and affectionate Son , F . C . WESTON CHURCHILL .
Mrs . John Knightley was delighted to be of use ; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to her -- and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr . Wingfield , she was quite eager to have Harriet under her care .-- When it was thus settled on her sister ' s side , Emma proposed it to her friend , and found her very persuadable .-- Harriet was to go ; she was invited for at least a fortnight ; she was to be conveyed in Mr . Woodhouse ' s carriage .-- It was all arranged , it was all completed , and Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square .
" Pray say no more .
said Emma , as she turned back into the hall again .
Mrs . Weston was disengaged and Emma began again --" Mr . Frank Churchill writes one of the best gentleman ' s hands I ever saw ."
He has been gone only four weeks ."
" I have to thank you , Miss Woodhouse , for a very kind forgiving message in one of Mrs . Weston ' s letters .
He had ridden home through the rain ; and had walked up directly after dinner , to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures , faultless in spite of all her faults , bore the discovery .
Perry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon South End ."
The event had every promise of happiness for her friend .
Mr . Perry did say so .
Emma watched and decided , that with such feelings as were now shewn , it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting himself ; that he had not been acting a part , or making a parade of insincere professions ; and that Mr . Knightley certainly had not done him justice .
After a few minutes of entire silence between them , John Knightley began with --
" You are ungrateful ."
" I have escaped ; and that I should escape , may be a matter of grateful wonder to you and myself .
They are known to no human being , I guess , but herself .
And so excellent in the Church !
Emma demurred .
" Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself ; and then the attraction may be the greater .
Most comfortable carriage .-- Oh !
She was his object , and every body must perceive it .
She went , however ; and when they reached the farm , and she was to be put down , at the end of the broad , neat gravel walk , which led between espalier apple - trees to the front door , the sight of every thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before , was beginning to revive a little local agitation ; and when they parted , Emma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity , which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour .
More is avowedly due to _her_ .
here ' s Miss Woodhouse .-- Dear Miss Woodhouse , how do you do ?-- Very well I thank you , quite well .
But it is even so .
I am losing all my bitterness against spoilt children , my dearest Emma .
The evening before this great event ( for it was a very great event that Mr . Woodhouse should dine out , on the 24th of December ) had been spent by Harriet at Hartfield , and she had gone home so much indisposed with a cold , that , but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs . Goddard , Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house .
It will be giving him so much pleasure !
She was rather low all the evening , but Emma could allow for her amiable regrets , and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection , sometimes by bringing forward the idea of Mr . Elton .
She thought there was an air of greater happiness than usual -- a glow both of complexion and spirits .
That was the act of a very , very young man , one too young to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure .
It seemed as if every thing united to promise the most interesting consequences .
Mr . Knightley , is not she ?"
" I rather wonder that it was never made before ."
I consider one as including the other .
His visit he would now defer ; but they had a very interesting parley about what could be done and should be done .
He was invited on good faith .
said he with a tender sigh , as he received it .
Emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first .
Poor little creatures , how unhappy she would have made them !"
It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast .
An unpretending , single - minded , artless girl -- infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a woman as Mrs . Elton .
how peculiarly unprepared I was !-- for I had reason to believe her very lately more determined against him , much more , than she was before ."
Your time has been properly and delicately spent , if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage .
Mr . and Mrs . John Knightley were to come down in August , and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back .
In the course of the spring she must return their civilities by one very superior party -- in which her card - tables should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs in the true style -- and more waiters engaged for the evening than their own establishment could furnish , to carry round the refreshments at exactly the proper hour , and in the proper order .
I see the difference plain enough .
She and Mrs . Weston were obliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together .
" Oh !
" I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father -- or even may be some encumbrance to you , if your visiting engagements continue to increase as much as they have done lately ."
" You may well be amazed ," returned Mrs . Weston , still averting her eyes , and talking on with eagerness , that Emma might have time to recover -- " You may well be amazed .
" Upon my word , Emma ."
Come , my dear Emma , let us be friends , and say no more about it .
here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us ; thank you for the sight of it .
" Oh !
You will never go to Swisserland .
We shall not be many , you know ."
She was not sorry .
