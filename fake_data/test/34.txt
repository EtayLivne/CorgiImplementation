Emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face ; and while paying her own compliments to Mrs . Bates , and appearing to attend to the good old lady ' s replies , she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax , and return it into the purple and gold reticule by her side , saying , with significant nods ,
And as to conceit , he is the farthest from it of any man I know .
I was very much pleased with all that he said .
It is infinitely too bad .
Mr . Woodhouse could never allow for Mr . Knightley ' s claims on his brother , or any body ' s claims on Isabella , except his own .
" We are sure of excellent fires ," continued he , " and every thing in the greatest comfort .
" Indeed !
She had understood it was to be delayed till Colonel Campbell ' s return ."
" Has he so !-- Then I know nothing of Mr . Elton .
Mr . Weston , however , too eager to be very observant , too communicative to want others to talk , was very well satisfied with what she did say , and soon moved away to make the rest of his friends happy by a partial communication of what the whole room must have overheard already .
There is no use in delay .
poor fellow !-- sad business for him .-- She was extremely concerned ; for , though very eccentric , he had a thousand good qualities .-- How could he be so taken in ?-- Did not think him at all in love -- not in the least .-- Poor Knightley !-- There would be an end of all pleasant intercourse with him .-- How happy he had been to come and dine with them whenever they asked him !
Nothing should separate her from her father .
" It is not very likely , my dear , that bathing should have been of use to her -- and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation , I would have spoken to --
He had no reason to wish his hair longer , to conceal any confusion of face ; no reason to wish the money unspent , to improve his spirits .
" It has a disagreeable look to me .
Frank Churchill came back again ; and if he kept his father ' s dinner waiting , it was not known at Hartfield ; for Mrs . Weston was too anxious for his being a favourite with Mr . Woodhouse , to betray any imperfection which could be concealed .
The idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse , whom she really loved extremely , made her wretched for a while , and when the violence of grief was comforted away , still remained powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it very tolerably .
Mr . Woodhouse at last was off ; but Mr . Knightley , instead of being immediately off likewise , sat down again , seemingly inclined for more chat .
" I certainly must ," said she .
" I am most happy to hear it -- but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be so very accomplished and superior !-- and exactly Emma ' s age ."
said he quietly , and looking at her ; " of what nature ?"
The unpersuadable point , which he did not mention , Emma guessed to be good behaviour to his father .
I shall go abroad for a couple of years -- and when I return , I shall come to you for my wife .
It was to be a whole - length in water - colours , like Mr . John Knightley ' s , and was destined , if she could please herself , to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece .
It need not detain us long .
I would be understood to mean , that it can be only weak , irresolute characters , ( whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance ,) who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience , an oppression for ever ."
Neither Mr . Suckling nor me had ever any patience with them ; and we used sometimes to say very cutting things !
" Oh !"
As a magistrate , he had generally some point of law to consult John about , or , at least , some curious anecdote to give ; and as a farmer , as keeping in hand the home - farm at Donwell , he had to tell what every field was to bear next year , and to give all such local information as could not fail of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his life , and whose attachments were strong .
Very happy to hear it .
Some are gone to the ponds , and some to the lime walk .
In no other light could you have been more to me than a common acquaintance .
And if he were to be lost to them for Harriet ' s sake ; if he were to be thought of hereafter , as finding in Harriet ' s society all that he wanted ; if Harriet were to be the chosen , the first , the dearest , the friend , the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence ; what could be increasing Emma ' s wretchedness but the reflection never far distant from her mind , that it had been all her own work ?
Miss Woodhouse , how kind you are !-- I suppose you have heard -- and are come to give us joy .
I like her the better for it .
I am sure she will be pleased with the children .
" She meant to be impertinently curious , just as such an Anne Cox should be ."
I am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty , and such temper , the highest claims a woman could possess ."
There were not merely no grammatical errors , but as a composition it would not have disgraced a gentleman ; the language , though plain , was strong and unaffected , and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer .
Yes , quite a proposal of marriage ; and a very good letter , at least she thought so .
" Well , Miss Woodhouse ," he almost immediately began , " your inclination for dancing has not been quite frightened away , I hope , by the terrors of my father ' s little rooms .
I praised the fair lady too , and altogether sent him away very happy .
He was not an ill - tempered man , not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a reproach ; but his temper was not his great perfection ; and , indeed , with such a worshipping wife , it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not be increased .
But I do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do .
That is _ship_ ;-- plain as it can be .-- Now for the cream .
" Mr .
" It comes to the same thing .
" Were you really ?-- Well !-- But you observed nothing of course , for it seems to be a new idea to you .-- If I had been there , I think I should have made some discoveries ."
_Some_ _part_ of his conduct we cannot excuse ."
Were I to fall in love , indeed , it would be a different thing !
This was the occurrence :-- The Coles had been settled some years in Highbury , and were very good sort of people -- friendly , liberal , and unpretending ; but , on the other hand , they were of low origin , in trade , and only moderately genteel .
" But , my dear sir , the difference of the journey ;-- only consider how great it would have been .-- An hundred miles , perhaps , instead of forty ."
I have no idea of that sort of thing .
" If I made myself intelligible yesterday , this letter will be expected ; but expected or not , I know it will be read with candour and indulgence .-- You are all goodness , and I believe there will be need of even all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past conduct .-- But I have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent .
Oh !
Elton ?"
Miss Churchill , however , being of age , and with the full command of her fortune -- though her fortune bore no proportion to the family - estate -- was not to be dissuaded from the marriage , and it took place , to the infinite mortification of Mr . and Mrs . Churchill , who threw her off with due decorum .
Harriet was one of those , who , having once begun , would be always in love .
" I do not know which it ought to be called ."
She is reserved , more reserved , I think , than she used to be -- And I love an open temper .
At another time Emma might have been amused , but she was too much astonished now at Mr . Elton ' s spirits for other feelings .
Emma looked at her , quite unable to speak .
She would keep the peace if possible ; and there was something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits , the all - sufficiency of home to himself , whence resulted her brother ' s disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse , and those to whom it was important .-- It had a high claim to forbearance .
--" At a watering - place , or in a common London acquaintance , it was difficult to decide on such points .
" But you need not imagine Mr . Weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up Henry or John .
All this ran so glibly through her thoughts , that by the time her father had arranged himself , after the bustle of the Eltons ' departure , and was ready to speak , she was very tolerably capable of attending .
" I am glad you think so ; and the good hands , I hope , may not be wanting ."
She had not even a share in his opening compliments .-- Her name was not mentioned ;-- and there was so striking a change in all this , and such an ill - judged solemnity of leave - taking in his graceful acknowledgments , as she thought , at first , could not escape her father ' s suspicion .
CHAPTER XIX
Some portion of respect for herself , however , in spite of all these demerits -- some concern for her own appearance , and a strong sense of justice by Harriet --( there would be no need of _compassion_ to the girl who believed herself loved by Mr . Knightley -- but justice required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now ,) gave Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness , with even apparent kindness .-- For her own advantage indeed , it was fit that the utmost extent of Harriet ' s hopes should be enquired into ; and Harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained -- or to deserve to be slighted by the person , whose counsels had never led her right .-- Rousing from reflection , therefore , and subduing her emotion , she turned to Harriet again , and , in a more inviting accent , renewed the conversation ; for as to the subject which had first introduced it , the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax , that was quite sunk and lost .-- Neither of them thought but of Mr . Knightley and themselves .
Harriet smiled again , and her smiles grew stronger .
" I have heard it asserted ," said John Knightley , " that the same sort of handwriting often prevails in a family ; and where the same master teaches , it is natural enough .
Emma found it really time to be at home ; the visit had already lasted long ; and on examining watches , so much of the morning was perceived to be gone , that Mrs . Weston and her companion taking leave also , could allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to Hartfield gates , before they set off for Randalls .
Did you ever hear any thing so strange ?
if you had seen her , as I did , when she was at the worst !"
Exquisite , quite exquisite !-- Still , however , having proceeded so far , one is unwilling to give the matter up .
This would not do ; she immediately stopped , under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing of her half - boot , and stooping down in complete occupation of the footpath , begged them to have the goodness to walk on , and she would follow in half a minute .
Better wait an hour or two , or even half a day for your letters , than run the risk of bringing on your cough again .
By the bye , _that_ is almost enough to put one out of conceit with a niece .
" It is not now worth a regret ," said Emma .
If it be not inconvenient to you , pray let us go in , that I may prove myself to belong to the place , to be a true citizen of Highbury .
" I had only my own family to study from .
" Emma , my love , you said that this circumstance would not now make you unhappy ; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected .
She was not to see Frank Churchill this morning .
she was considerably worse from this reappearance of Mr . Elton .
If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment , I have nothing to say against it , but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me .-- Oh !
CHAPTER XVIII
" Yes , sir , I did indeed ; and I am very much obliged by your kind solicitude about me ."
You would not wish to disappoint and mortify the Coles , I am sure , sir ; friendly , good sort of people as ever lived , and who have been your neighbours these _ten_ years ."
The two ladies looked over it together ; and he sat smiling and talking to them the whole time , in a voice a little subdued , but very audible to every body .
We must remember to let James know that the carriage will be wanted on Tuesday .
We never heard of such things at Maple Grove ."
" Thank you .
" Low , I am afraid , sir , very low ," answered his son ;--" but we shall be indulgent -- especially to any one who leads the way ."
He knows that he is a very handsome young man , and a great favourite wherever he goes ; and from his general way of talking in unreserved moments , when there are only men present , I am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away .
and she and her partner the happiest !--" I said it would be so ," was the only consolation .
" What an amiable creature I was !-- No wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance ."
Gilbert would have danced the other evening , if she had been asked .
" You will excuse my being so much over - powered .
