Knightley .'
" Robert Martin has no great loss -- if he can but think so ; and I hope it will not be long before he does .
It was the very circumstance he could have wished for .
I was a kinder friend than you deserved .
Will you chuse a wife for me ?-- I am sure I should like any body fixed on by you .
It seemed as if every thing united to promise the most interesting consequences .
" I do not know .-- One of the Otways .-- Not Frank ;-- it is not Frank , I assure you .
In this state of suspense they were befriended , not by any sudden illumination of Mr . Woodhouse ' s mind , or any wonderful change of his nervous system , but by the operation of the same system in another way .-- Mrs . Weston ' s poultry - house was robbed one night of all her turkeys -- evidently by the ingenuity of man .
" The ladies were all at home ."
" To be sure we do ," cried his father ; " Mrs . Bates -- we passed her house -- I saw Miss Bates at the window .
Indeed you should take care of yourself as well as of your friend .
" I never had the smallest , I assure you ."
Knightley ."
I give you this caution now , because I shall never speak to you again on the subject .
He came back , had had his hair cut , and laughed at himself with a very good grace , but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he had done .
Observe the turn of her throat .
" I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry .
I wish her extremely well : and , no doubt , there are men who might not object to -- Every body has their level : but as for myself , I am not , I think , quite so much at a loss .
I believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing - room that we are expecting Frank .
Her mind was quite sick of Mr . Elton and the Martins .
" No , sir ," cried Emma , " it confesses no such thing .
It is such a happiness when good people get together -- and they always do .
I had not thought of Mrs . Dixon .
Mrs . Weston was looking so ill , and had an air of so much perturbation , that Emma ' s uneasiness increased ; and the moment they were alone , she eagerly said ,
His first proposition and request , that the dance begun at Mr . Cole ' s should be finished there -- that the same party should be collected , and the same musician engaged , met with the readiest acquiescence .
" Come , come ," cried Emma , feeling this to be an unsafe subject , " I must beg you not to talk of the sea .
They must both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and concealment ."
" Certainly .
said I , ` it is Miss Woodhouse : I am sure you will like to see her .'
I heard a good deal of Colonel Campbell ' s taste at Weymouth ; and the softness of the upper notes I am sure is exactly what he and _all_ _that_ _party_ would particularly prize .
" Miss Woodhouse , as you will not give me your opinion , I must do as well as I can by myself ; and I have now quite determined , and really almost made up my mind -- to refuse Mr . Martin .
Our part of London is very superior to most others !-- You must not confound us with London in general , my dear sir .
" Have you indeed , sir ?-- Bless me !
Emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little self - willed , and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of dancing with her ; but she took the compliment , and forgave the rest .
" She will be all delight and gratitude , but she will tell you nothing .
She knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than she could perform with credit ; she wanted neither taste nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable , and could accompany her own voice well .
My being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration .
Mr . Weston , you must really have had Aladdin ' s lamp .
I absolutely cannot do without music .
It will do you good to speak of your distress , whatever it may be ."
She looked down the Randalls road .
" You must make my apologies to your friend ; but so good a charade must not be confined to one or two .
He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte , and turning to Emma , said ,
" Oh !
She does not depend upon his coming so much as I do : but she does not know the parties so well as I do .
Mr . Churchill had made a point of it , as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost ; and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum ."
had she never brought Harriet forward !
but dear Miss Woodhouse , she is now in such retirement , such obscurity , so thrown away .-- Whatever advantages she may have enjoyed with the Campbells are so palpably at an end !
She must see more of him to understand his ways ; at present she only felt they were agreeable .
I wish her extremely well : and , no doubt , there are men who might not object to -- Every body has their level : but as for myself , I am not , I think , quite so much at a loss .
" Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her , or that she admired him ?"
and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to me -- this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody -- though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the Campbells , may it not be from Mr . Knightley ?
thought Emma .
I shall have no fears for you with him .
I never could have an idea of any body else -- and so I thought you knew .
" No indeed I have not .
The remaining five were left to their own powers , and Emma doubted their getting on very well ; for Mr . Knightley seemed little disposed for conversation ; Mrs . Elton was wanting notice , which nobody had inclination to pay , and she was herself in a worry of spirits which would have made her prefer being silent .
You did not enjoy them as I did ; you appeared tired the whole time .
The like reserve prevailed on other topics .
But there is nobody hereabouts to attach her ; and she goes so seldom from home ."
But what shall I say ?
He had nestled down his head most conveniently .
" I hope you did not venture far , Miss Fairfax , this morning , or I am sure you must have been wet .-- We scarcely got home in time .
He had nestled down his head most conveniently .
His coming to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved .
My friend Robert could not resist .
Being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling , I have been in no hurry with my congratulations ; but I hope it all went off tolerably well .
She held the parcel towards her , and Emma read the words _Most_ _precious_ _treasures_ on the top .
She was warmly gratified -- and in another moment still more so , by a little movement of more than common friendliness on his part .-- He took her hand ;-- whether she had not herself made the first motion , she could not say -- she might , perhaps , have rather offered it -- but he took her hand , pressed it , and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips -- when , from some fancy or other , he suddenly let it go .-- Why he should feel such a scruple , why he should change his mind when it was all but done , she could not perceive .-- He would have judged better , she thought , if he had not stopped .-- The intention , however , was indubitable ; and whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry , or however else it happened , but she thought nothing became him more .-- It was with him , of so simple , yet so dignified a nature .-- She could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction .
Her intentions were unchanged .
Waiving that point , however , and supposing her to be , as you describe her , only pretty and good - natured , let me tell you , that in the degree she possesses them , they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general , for she is , in fact , a beautiful girl , and must be thought so by ninety - nine people out of an hundred ; and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed ; till they do fall in love with well - informed minds instead of handsome faces , a girl , with such loveliness as Harriet , has a certainty of being admired and sought after , of having the power of chusing from among many , consequently a claim to be nice .
Oh yes !
They will stay a good while when they do come , and he will be half his time with us .
This , on his side , might merely proceed from her not being thought of ; but Emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy , and a suspicion , from some appearances , that their friendship were declining .
She spoke with great agitation ; and Emma very feelingly replied , " That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now .
It is a necessary of life to me ; and having always been used to a very musical society , both at Maple Grove and in Bath , it would have been a most serious sacrifice .
" Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr . Elton ' s marrying , Harriet , is the strongest reproach you can make _me_ .
When she looked at the hedges , she thought the elder at least must soon be coming out ; and when she turned round to Harriet , she saw something like a look of spring , a tender smile even there .
" I wish we could contrive it ," said she ; " but I cannot think of any tolerable pretence for going in ;-- no servant that I want to inquire about of his housekeeper -- no message from my father ."
My dear Emma , I am longing to talk to you .
It was a child ' s play , chosen to conceal a deeper game on Frank Churchill ' s part .
There had been no real affection either in his language or manners .
What is right to be done cannot be done too soon .
Those who can barely live , and who live perforce in a very small , and generally very inferior , society , may well be illiberal and cross .
She would be placed in the midst of those who loved her , and who had better sense than herself ; retired enough for safety , and occupied enough for cheerfulness .
" Well ," said the still waiting Harriet ;--" well -- and -- and what shall I do ?"
We were always glad to see him at Hartfield ."
" There is so pointed , and so particular a meaning in this compliment ," said she , " that I cannot have a doubt as to Mr . Elton ' s intentions .
She made her plan ; she would speak of something totally different -- the children in Brunswick Square ; and she only waited for breath to begin , when Mr . Knightley startled her , by saying ,
Every thing as natural and simple as possible .
The gruel came and supplied a great deal to be said -- much praise and many comments -- undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution , and pretty severe Philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with tolerable ;-- but , unfortunately , among the failures which the daughter had to instance , the most recent , and therefore most prominent , was in her own cook at South End , a young woman hired for the time , who never had been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel , thin , but not too thin .
go to - day , go to - day .
For once in your life you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken .
Goddard ' s ."
I am sure Mr . Elton will lose no time in calling on him ; and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage ."
I had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name , which I was not at all pleased with .
" Do you ?-- I have no doubt .
We have never been there above once since the new approach was made ; but still I have no doubt that James will take you very safely .
Weston ."
