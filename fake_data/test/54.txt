you are too obliging !
I am sure she does .
Mr . Knightley , in fact , was one of the few people who could see faults in Emma Woodhouse , and the only one who ever told her of them : and though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself , she knew it would be so much less so to her father , that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body .
If any thing , you are too attentive .
Let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of .
She could not endure its noise .
Could not have imagined it .-- So well lighted up !-- Jane , Jane , look !-- did you ever see any thing ?
she cried , looking aghast .
With respect to her father , it was a question soon answered .
How cheerful , how animated , how suspicious , how busy their imaginations all are !"
Do you mean with regard to this letter ?"
Every body had a degree of gravity and sorrow ; tenderness towards the departed , solicitude for the surviving friends ; and , in a reasonable time , curiosity to know where she would be buried .
replied the happily deceived aunt , while eagerly hunting for the letter .--" Oh !
In her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her .
The case , you see , is --( but this is quite between ourselves : I did not mention a syllable of it in the other room .
She said no more , other subjects took their turn ; and the rest of the dinner passed away ; the dessert succeeded , the children came in , and were talked to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation ; a few clever things said , a few downright silly , but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the other -- nothing worse than everyday remarks , dull repetitions , old news , and heavy jokes .
Maple Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be -- for we do not at all affect to equal my brother , Mr . Suckling , in income .-- However , my resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax .-- I shall certainly have her very often at my house , shall introduce her wherever I can , shall have musical parties to draw out her talents , and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation .
A letter arrived from Mr . Churchill to urge his nephew ' s instant return .
Oh !
He was thinking .
Her father was growing nervous , and could not understand _her_ .
" Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would ."
My father depends on it .
You will say that I am quite an invalid , and go no where , and therefore must decline their obliging invitation ; beginning with my _compliments_ , of course .
He recommended it for all the children , but particularly for the weakness in little Bella ' s throat ,-- both sea air and bathing ."
Cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours ."
But it would not do ; he had not come to the point .
not handsome -- not at all handsome .
She would be placed in the midst of those who loved her , and who had better sense than herself ; retired enough for safety , and occupied enough for cheerfulness .
" You take up an idea , Mrs . Weston , and run away with it ; as you have many a time reproached me with doing .
She read , and was surprized .
I condition for nothing else ; but without music , life would be a blank to me .'"
Her influence would have been enough .
" Have you indeed , sir ?-- Bless me !
Mr . Elton must smile less , and Mr . John Knightley more , to fit them for the place .-- Emma only might be as nature prompted , and shew herself just as happy as she was .
It was an alarming change ; and Emma was thinking of it one morning , as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her , when Mr . Knightley came in , and distressing thoughts were put by .
The simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature , her contented and grateful spirit , were a recommendation to every body , and a mine of felicity to herself .
cried Harriet , warmly .
If it were love , it might be simple , single , successless love on her side alone .
His dancing proved to be just what she had believed it , extremely good ; and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky , if it had not been for the cruel state of things before , and for the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction which her happy features announced .
She then broke the lace off short , and dexterously throwing it into a ditch , was presently obliged to entreat them to stop , and acknowledged her inability to put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort .
She was happy , she knew she was happy , and knew she ought to be happy .
What !-- engaged to her all the winter -- before either of them came to Highbury ?"
Harriet is disgraced by any comparison .
Emma felt the bad taste of her friend , but let it pass with a " very true ; and it would be a small consolation to her , for the clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day , to know that her husband could write a good letter ."
He would be always coming over .
Still , however , though every thing had not been accomplished by her ingenious device , she could not but flatter herself that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both , and must be leading them forward to the great event .
You make the best of it -- but after you have been a week at Hartfield , you are all of you different creatures ; you do not look like the same .
She wished him to speak , but he would not .
There could be no harm in a scheme , a mere passive scheme .
" I wish ," said Mrs . Weston , " one could know which arrangement our guests in general would like best .
But is it possible that you had no suspicion ?-- I mean of late .
Mrs . Weston and Emma were sitting together on a sofa .
If Jane does not get well soon , we will call in Mr . Perry .
She was too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply : and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for Mr . Elton ' s sanguine state of mind , he tried to take her hand again , as he joyously exclaimed --
How improperly had she been acting by Harriet !
It was an alarming change ; and Emma was thinking of it one morning , as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her , when Mr . Knightley came in , and distressing thoughts were put by .
" Miss Woodhouse , as you will not give me your opinion , I must do as well as I can by myself ; and I have now quite determined , and really almost made up my mind -- to refuse Mr . Martin .
Jane Fairfax was an orphan , the only child of Mrs . Bates ' s youngest daughter .
The contrivances of modern days indeed have rendered a gentleman ' s carriage perfectly complete .
I always say there is something direful in the sound : but nothing more is positively known of the Tupmans , though a good many things I assure you are suspected ; and yet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to my brother , Mr . Suckling , who happens to be one of their nearest neighbours .
How could you be so unfeeling to Miss Bates ?
The first error and the worst lay at her door .
You persuaded her to refuse him ."
I knew he would !"
To be sure , the charade , with its " ready wit "-- but then the " soft eyes "-- in fact it suited neither ; it was a jumble without taste or truth .
" But you have not seen so much of the world as I have .
The aunt was a capricious woman , and governed her husband entirely ; but it was not in Mr . Weston ' s nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear , and , as he believed , so deservedly dear .
" Be satisfied ," said he , " I will not raise any outcry .
She talked with a great deal of reason , and at least equal affection -- but she had too much to urge for Emma ' s attention ; it was soon gone to Brunswick Square or to Donwell ; she forgot to attempt to listen ; and when Mrs . Weston ended with , " We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for , you know , but I hope it will soon come ," she was obliged to pause before she answered , and at last obliged to answer at random , before she could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for .
A real injury to the children -- a most mortifying change , and material loss to them all ;-- a very great deduction from her father ' s daily comfort -- and , as to herself , she could not at all endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey .
Mr . and Mrs . Elton appeared ; and all the smiles and the proprieties passed .
I do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself , and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them ."
A private dance , without sitting down to supper , was pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women ; and Mrs . Weston must not speak of it again .
" Oh !
It does not bear talking of ."
" Three - and - twenty !-- is he indeed ?-- Well , I could not have thought it -- and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother !
Goldsmith tells us , that when lovely woman stoops to folly , she has nothing to do but to die ; and when she stoops to be disagreeable , it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill - fame .
my dear , I wish you would not make matches and foretell things , for whatever you say always comes to pass .
Mr . Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it , besides all the history of his own and Isabella ' s coming , and of Emma ' s being to follow , and had indeed just got to the end of his satisfaction that James should come and see his daughter , when the others appeared , and Mrs . Weston , who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him , was able to turn away and welcome her dear Emma .
Dixon is very musical , is he ?
It had not been forgotten before , but it had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day .
I remember one evening the poor boys saying , ` Uncle seems always tired now .'"
Perhaps he wanted to speak to her , of his attachment to Harriet ; he might be watching for encouragement to begin .-- She did not , could not , feel equal to lead the way to any such subject .
Cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours ."
Jane says that Colonel Campbell is a little deaf .
" It is my duty , and I am sure it is my wish ," she continued , " to have no reserves with you on this subject .
Let us be discreet -- quite on our good behaviour .-- Hush !-- You remember those lines -- I forget the poem at this moment :
She could then see more and judge better .
She shewed it to me .
He did not think we ever walked this road .
Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech , and saw no alarming symptoms of love .
" You are not quite so miserable , though , as when you first came .
There will be the leg to be salted , you know , which is so very nice , and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like ."
It was a long , well - written letter , giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings , expressing all the affection , gratitude , and respect which was natural and honourable , and describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed attractive , with spirit and precision .
In half a minute they were in the room .
But as to my _letting_ her marry Robert Martin , it is impossible ; she has refused him , and so decidedly , I think , as must prevent any second application .
" Well , well , I am ready ;"-- and turning again to Emma , " but you must not be expecting such a _very_ fine young man ; you have only had _my_ account you know ; I dare say he is really nothing extraordinary :"-- though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very different conviction .
Perhaps she might have passed over more had his manners been flattering to Isabella ' s sister , but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend , without praise and without blindness ; but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her regardless of that greatest fault of all in her eyes which he sometimes fell into , the want of respectful forbearance towards her father .
" But , my dear sir , the difference of the journey ;-- only consider how great it would have been .-- An hundred miles , perhaps , instead of forty ."
