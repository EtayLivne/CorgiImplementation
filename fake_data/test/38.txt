Do not run away with such an idea ."
And it is no small credit , in my opinion , to him , that he should excite such an affection ; for , though I would not say it to any body else , she has no more heart than a stone to people in general ; and the devil of a temper ."
" I have the greatest pleasure , my dear Emma , in forwarding to you the enclosed .
It must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed ; and she hoped , that when able to see them together again , she might at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were .-- She should see them henceforward with the closest observance ; and wretchedly as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching , she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here .-- He was expected back every day .
" I met William Larkins ," continued Mr . Elton , " as I got near the house , and he told me I should not find his master at home , but I did not believe him .-- William seemed rather out of humour .
" He is very plain , undoubtedly -- remarkably plain :-- but that is nothing compared with his entire want of gentility .
I wanted to keep it from Jane ' s knowledge ; but , unluckily , I had mentioned it before I was aware ."
Knightley ."
" I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than Mr . Elton .
Mr . Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser , and she knew Mr . Elton looked up to him .
.
He had not been at Donwell for two years .
" Imprudent , if you please -- but not mad .
He came down by yesterday ' s coach , and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast , to report his proceedings , first on my affairs , and then on his own .
I do not mean to say , however , that you might not have made discoveries ."
A sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded by her general state , had carried her off after a short struggle .
It was a child ' s play , chosen to conceal a deeper game on Frank Churchill ' s part .
I must order the carriage .
Pray , dear Miss Woodhouse , tell me what I ought to do ."
Mr . Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled ; but the worst was overcome , the idea was given ; time and continual repetition must do the rest .-- To Emma ' s entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr . Knightley ' s , whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome ; and he was soon used to be talked to by each , on every fair occasion .-- They had all the assistance which Isabella could give , by letters of the strongest approbation ; and Mrs . Weston was ready , on the first meeting , to consider the subject in the most serviceable light -- first , as a settled , and , secondly , as a good one -- well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to Mr . Woodhouse ' s mind .-- It was agreed upon , as what was to be ; and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness ; and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it , he began to think that some time or other -- in another year or two , perhaps -- it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place .
" I do pity you .
But ah !
" You are speaking of letters of business ; mine are letters of friendship ."
" But , my dear , pray do not make any more matches ; they are silly things , and break up one ' s family circle grievously ."
" My picture !-- But he has left my picture in Bond - street ."
" Very well ; and if he had intended to give her one , he would have told her so ."
Yet he would speak .
Early , I know , you had none ."
In half an hour the arrowroot was returned , with a thousand thanks from Miss Bates , but " dear Jane would not be satisfied without its being sent back ; it was a thing she could not take -- and , moreover , she insisted on her saying , that she was not at all in want of any thing ."
" I am afraid ," returned Emma , sighing , " that I must often have contributed to make her unhappy ."
I dare say he will come in when he knows who is here .
Consider from how partial a quarter your information came .
Every body knows what is due to _you_ ."
" No ," said he , smiling , " that is no subject of regret at all .
I never could have an idea of any body else -- and so I thought you knew .
said Jane , shaking her head ; " dear Mrs . Elton , who can have thought of it as I have done ?"
but Jane Fairfax has them both , Harriet ."
" Indeed you did .
I cannot doubt it .
I am very sure you did me good .
CHARADE .
Happily , it was now time to be gone .
" Oh !
I should not have used the expression .
It was a style of beauty , of which elegance was the reigning character , and as such , she must , in honour , by all her principles , admire it :-- elegance , which , whether of person or of mind , she saw so little in Highbury .
" By all means , if you can ."
" Jane Fairfax has feeling ," said Mr . Knightley --" I do not accuse her of want of feeling .
Ever since I left you this morning , Emma , my mind has been hard at work on one subject ."
Cannot you imagine , Mr . Knightley , what a _sensation_ his coming will produce ?
" You talk a great deal of the length of this passage , my dear .
But it is even so .
" Oh !
His appearance is so much against him , and his manner so bad , that if she ever were disposed to favour him , she is not now .
I know what you mean -- but Emma ' s hand is the strongest ."
I hope time has not made you less willing to pardon .
Frank Churchill comes as regularly into my mind !"
That was the wind - up of the history ; that was the glory of Miss Hawkins .
The others had been talking of the child , Mrs . Weston giving an account of a little alarm she had been under , the evening before , from the infant ' s appearing not quite well .
My dear sir , you are too obliging .-- Is there nobody you would not rather ?-- I am not helpless .
" This is very true ," said she , " at least as far as relates to me , which was all that was meant -- and it is very shameful .-- Of the same age -- and always knowing her -- I ought to have been more her friend .-- She will never like me now .
She had hurried on before her guests to prepare her father for their appearance , and was beyond the reach of Mr . Weston ' s hint .
And such a noble fire !-- I am quite roasted .
I dared not address her openly ; my difficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well known to require definition ; and I was fortunate enough to prevail , before we parted at Weymouth , and to induce the most upright female mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement .-- Had she refused , I should have gone mad .-- But you will be ready to say , what was your hope in doing this ?-- What did you look forward to ?-- To any thing , every thing -- to time , chance , circumstance , slow effects , sudden bursts , perseverance and weariness , health and sickness .
Ambition , as well as love , had probably been mortified .
I am sure she is very good -- I hope she will be very happy .
She had no doubt as to his being less in love -- but neither his agitated spirits , nor his hurrying away , seemed like a perfect cure ; and she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her returning power , and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself with her long .
Its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind -- and it must be saving her from the danger of degradation .
I was there -- one of the party ."
And it was spoken with a sort of sighing animation , which had a vast deal of the lover .
" Thank you , thank you -- but on no account .-- I would rather walk .-- And for _me_ to be afraid of walking alone !-- I , who may so soon have to guard others !"
We never heard of such things at Maple Grove ."
Mr . Weston was a great favourite , and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserve , as to his wife ; not any one , to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and understood , of being always interesting and always intelligible , the little affairs , arrangements , perplexities , and pleasures of her father and herself .
You never wrote a truer line ."
When had his influence , such influence begun ?-- When had he succeeded to that place in her affection , which Frank Churchill had once , for a short period , occupied ?-- She looked back ; she compared the two -- compared them , as they had always stood in her estimation , from the time of the latter ' s becoming known to her -- and as they must at any time have been compared by her , had it -- oh !
" I hope he will be here to - morrow , for I have a question or two to ask him about myself of some consequence .
" Thank you , thank you .-- This is just what I wanted to be assured of .-- Oh !
" Is not she ?
Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr . Weston , and had half a mind to take it up ; but she struggled , and let it pass .
Emma demurred .
Mr . Elton must smile less , and Mr . John Knightley more , to fit them for the place .-- Emma only might be as nature prompted , and shew herself just as happy as she was .
Every body is lazy !
" I shall not scold you .
" Four o ' clock !-- depend upon it he will be here by three ," was Mr . Weston ' s quick amendment ; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting .
If he means any thing , it must be to please you .
I have a great regard for you and Emma ; but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence !-- At any rate , it must be better to have only one to please than two ."
" Thank you .
Harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion .
But Miss Bates soon came --" Very happy and obliged "-- but Emma ' s conscience told her that there was not the same cheerful volubility as before -- less ease of look and manner .
My mother is delightfully well ; and Jane caught no cold last night .
If you do not call early it will be a slight ."
Miss Bates said a great deal ; Mrs . Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse ' s presiding ; Mr . Knightley ' s answer was the most distinct .
It was a private resolution of hers , not communicated to him -- or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction .-- Till yesterday , I know he said he was in the dark as to her plans .
If he were quite sincere , if he really tried to come , it was to be inferred that Mrs . Churchill ' s removal to London had been of no service to the wilful or nervous part of her disorder .
` Can I do any thing for you at Kingston ?'
" Not a walk in the rain , I should imagine ."
She could not but hear ; she could not avoid answering ,
He loved to have the cloth laid , because it had been the fashion of his youth , but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it ; and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing , his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat .
After these came a second set ; among the most come - at - able of whom were Mrs . and Miss Bates , and Mrs . Goddard , three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield , and who were fetched and carried home so often , that Mr . Woodhouse thought it no hardship for either James or the horses .
Did not you observe her manner of answering me ?
In half a minute they were in the room .
