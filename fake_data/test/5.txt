snows a little I see ."
said she .--" To chuse to remain here month after month , under privations of every sort !
It is just what I used to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship , when , because things did not go quite right , did not proceed with all the rapidity which suited his feelings , he was apt to be in despair , and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be _May_ before Hymen ' s saffron robe would be put on for us .
CHAPTER XII
She thought it was time to make up .
CHAPTER XVIII
" Aye , very true .-- I wish I could recollect more of it .
Henceforward I know nothing of the matter .
He knows he is wrong , and has nothing rational to urge .-- Bad .-- He ought not to have formed the engagement .--` His father ' s disposition :'-- he is unjust , however , to his father .
A very friendly shake of the hand , a very earnest " Good - bye ," closed the speech , and the door had soon shut out Frank Churchill .
It was a dislike so little just -- every imputed fault was so magnified by fancy , that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any considerable absence , without feeling that she had injured her ; and now , when the due visit was paid , on her arrival , after a two years ' interval , she was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners , which for those two whole years she had been depreciating .
She was sorry , very sorry .
Some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings .
" You will excuse my being so much over - powered .
such delicacy !-- and yet without being actually fair .-- One cannot call her fair .
Emma thought first of herself , and then of Harriet .
` Well ,' said she , ` it must be borne some time or other , and it may as well be now .'
" Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell ," said she , in a voice of forced calmness , " I can imagine nothing with any confidence .
If the errand were not a pleasure to me , it could be done , as it always is when I am not here , by my grandmama ' s ."
I am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty , and such temper , the highest claims a woman could possess ."
Miss Churchill , however , being of age , and with the full command of her fortune -- though her fortune bore no proportion to the family - estate -- was not to be dissuaded from the marriage , and it took place , to the infinite mortification of Mr . and Mrs . Churchill , who threw her off with due decorum .
This is a sort of dull - looking evening , that ought to be treated rather as winter than summer .
" I cannot think there is any danger of it ," was Emma ' s calm answer -- " and when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax ' s situation and understand what her home has been , with Colonel and Mrs . Campbell , I have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown ."
Towards the end of Jane ' s second song , her voice grew thick .
said he .
" She must be under some sort of penance , inflicted either by the Campbells or herself .
It was a style of beauty , of which elegance was the reigning character , and as such , she must , in honour , by all her principles , admire it :-- elegance , which , whether of person or of mind , she saw so little in Highbury .
to be sure ," cried Emma , " it is always incomprehensible to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage .
She was wanting to see him again , and especially to see him in company with Mrs . Weston , upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him was to depend .
" I am here on no business of my own ," said Emma ; " I am only waiting for my friend .
Mr . Churchill would never get over it ."
We are to walk about your gardens , and gather the strawberries ourselves , and sit under trees ;-- and whatever else you may like to provide , it is to be all out of doors -- a table spread in the shade , you know .
madness , if it is so ; but I hope you are mistaken ."
I dare say she did not understand me ."
Grandmama was quite well , had a charming evening with Mr . Woodhouse , a vast deal of chat , and backgammon .-- Tea was made downstairs , biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came away : amazing luck in some of her throws : and she inquired a great deal about you , how you were amused , and who were your partners .
And so she began inquiring after her directly , saying , ` I know you cannot have heard from Jane lately , because it is not her time for writing ;' and when I immediately said , ` But indeed we have , we had a letter this very morning ,' I do not know that I ever saw any body more surprized .
" It is very unfair to judge of any body ' s conduct , without an intimate knowledge of their situation .
" News !
" I do not say it is so ; but you will do well to consider whether it is so or not , and to regulate your behaviour accordingly .
" Oh , what a sweet house !-- How very beautiful !-- There are the yellow curtains that Miss Nash admires so much ."
" Indeed !-- from Yorkshire , I think .
" I am glad you approve of what I have done ," said he very comfortably .
" Yes -- rather -- I have been thinking of it some little time ."
Mrs . Weston -- it is too calm a censure .
If I had not promoted Mr . Weston ' s visits here , and given many little encouragements , and smoothed many little matters , it might not have come to any thing after all .
How is Miss Fairfax ?-- I hope she caught no cold last night .
Emma accepted it with a very eager hand , with an impatience all alive to know what he would say about it , and not at all checked by hearing that her friend was unmentioned .
Knightley must never marry .
The touch seemed immediate .
I do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us , Harriet , by additional softness , but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be .
" A very serious sort , I assure you ;" still smiling .
" Perhaps it is as well ," said Frank Churchill , as he attended Emma to her carriage .
A very gracious invitation was returned , and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion .
" Thank you , thank you , my own sweet little friend .
When the ladies returned to the drawing - room after dinner , Emma found it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties ;-- with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did Mrs . Elton engross Jane Fairfax and slight herself .
Mr . Knightley promises to give up his claim this Christmas -- though you know it is longer since they were with him , than with us ."
Of very important , very recordable events , it was not more productive than such meetings usually are .
You had , somehow or other , broken bounds yesterday , and run away from your own management ; but to - day you are got back again -- and as I cannot be always with you , it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine ."
She wanted , rather , to be quiet , and out of temptation ; but still , as it was desirable that she should appear , in general , like her usual self , she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance , and enter as warmly into Mr . and Mrs . Weston ' s disappointment , as might naturally belong to their friendship .
" Your parish there was small ," said Jane .
" It is as well , perhaps , that I have not had the possibility .
He had been sitting with her , it appeared , most companionably at home , till her usual hour of exercise ; and on being desired to chuse their walk , immediately fixed on Highbury .--" He did not doubt there being very pleasant walks in every direction , but if left to him , he should always chuse the same .
" _You_ probably have been less surprized than any of us , for you have had your suspicions .-- I have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution .-- I wish I had attended to it -- but --( with a sinking voice and a heavy sigh ) I seem to have been doomed to blindness ."
" Oh !
" Pray , Emma ," said he , " may I ask in what lay the great amusement , the poignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax ?
She had been decided in wishing for a Miss Weston .
You think so , do not you ?"
Mr . Woodhouse soon followed ; and the necessity of exertion made him composed .
or is it too short ?"
Emma ' s only surprize was that Jane Fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate Mrs . Elton as she seemed to do .
A warm climate may be prescribed for her .
I was snowed up at a friend ' s house once for a week .
my dear ; but so much as Patty has to do !-- And it is a kindness to employ our men ."
She was feeling too much ; but at last Emma collected from her enough to understand the sort of meeting , and the sort of pain it was creating .
After such behaviour , as I have witnessed during the last month , to Miss Smith -- such attentions as I have been in the daily habit of observing -- to be addressing me in this manner -- this is an unsteadiness of character , indeed , which I had not supposed possible !
The dream must be borne with , and Mr . Knightley must take his seat with the rest round the large modern circular table which Emma had introduced at Hartfield , and which none but Emma could have had power to place there and persuade her father to use , instead of the small - sized Pembroke , on which two of his daily meals had , for forty years been crowded .
It is so with some men .
Harriet was too much agitated to encounter him .
She was particularly struck by his manner of considering Mr . Elton ' s house , which , as well as the church , he would go and look at , and would not join them in finding much fault with .
These kind of things are very well at Christmas , when one is sitting round the fire ; but quite out of place , in my opinion , when one is exploring about the country in summer .
She was so surprized she did not know what to do .
ma ' am , but there may be a difficulty .
" Mrs . Cole has servants to send .
I wish you may not catch cold ."
" Is not she looking well ?"
Do you know how Miss Bates and her niece came here ?"
was her immediate exclamation .
And I am not only , not going to be married , at present , but have very little intention of ever marrying at all ."
Was it new for one , perhaps too busy to seek , to be the prize of a girl who would seek him ?-- Was it new for any thing in this world to be unequal , inconsistent , incongruous -- or for chance and circumstance ( as second causes ) to direct the human fate ?
The Churchills might not have a word to say in return ; but then , you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through .
Quite a surprize to me !
She now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark .
yes -- did not you know ?-- Well , well , never mind ."
dear , no , never ."
The other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax ; and there she had no doubt .
You made a lucky guess ; and _that_ is all that can be said ."
Do you think I am right ?"
This is brilliant indeed !-- This is admirable !-- Excellently contrived , upon my word .
Short letters from Frank were received at Randalls , communicating all that was immediately important of their state and plans .
" It is as well , perhaps , that I have not had the possibility .
