cried Emma , not attending to her .--" Mrs .
" You may depend upon me ," said she .
Somebody else believed _Mrs_ .
Mr . Elton had retreated into the card - room , looking ( Emma trusted ) very foolish .
He asked my opinion as to what he was now to do .
I never could have supposed it .
He had not left her long , by no means long enough for her to have the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else , when a letter was brought her from Randalls -- a very thick letter ;-- she guessed what it must contain , and deprecated the necessity of reading it .-- She was now in perfect charity with Frank Churchill ; she wanted no explanations , she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself -- and as for understanding any thing he wrote , she was sure she was incapable of it .-- It must be waded through , however .
Miss Bates , let Emma help you to a _little_ bit of tart -- a _very_ little bit .
Her parting look was grateful -- and her parting words , " Oh !
Her present home , he could not but observe , was unfavourable to a nervous disorder :-- confined always to one room ;-- he could have wished it otherwise -- and her good aunt , though his very old friend , he must acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description .
Escape , however , was not his plan .
And , upon my word , I do not think Mr . Knightley would be much disturbed by Miss Bates .
They want her ( Mr . and Mrs . Dixon ) excessively to come over with Colonel and Mrs . Campbell ; quite depend upon it ; nothing can be more kind or pressing than their _joint_ invitation , Jane says , as you will hear presently ; Mr . Dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention .
He must be gone within a few hours , though without feeling any real alarm for his aunt , to lessen his repugnance .
Don ' t pretend to be in raptures about mine .
papa -- that is what you never have been able to accomplish , and I do not think you ever will .
How nicely you talk ; I love to hear you .
" You are better placed _here_ ; very fit for a wife , but not at all for a governess .
" Now ," said Harriet , " you _must_ recollect ."
Considering how very handsome she is , she appears to be little occupied with it ; her vanity lies another way .
A sudden freak seemed to have seized him at breakfast , and he had sent for a chaise and set off , intending to return to dinner , but with no more important view that appeared than having his hair cut .
I am delighted to find that you can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander -- but it will not do -- very sorry to check you in your first essay -- but indeed it will not do .
I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions , though you make so noble a profession of doing it , but I honestly tell you what they are ."
It is not likely that I _should_ , considering what I have been used to .
She had long resolved that one - and - twenty should be the period .
Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me .
Knightley must not marry !-- You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell ?-- Oh !
The consciousness of having done amiss , had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes , and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been -- that had been -- hard for him to bear .
she found something else must be done .
I can never bear to think of you all there without me ."
" I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind ; but excuse me , Mr . Knightley , if I take the liberty ( I consider myself , you know , as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma ' s mother might have had ) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith ' s intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you .
He seemed hardly to hear her ; he was thoughtful -- and in a manner which shewed him not pleased , soon afterwards said ,
Only one page more .
He saw that Emma had soon made it out , and found it highly entertaining , though it was something which she judged it proper to appear to censure ; for she said , " Nonsense !
I mention no names ; but happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet !"
I must get on to Kingston as fast as I can ."
Mr . Weston , I dare say , has been telling you exactly how the matter stands ?"
You are not serious ?
A private dance , without sitting down to supper , was pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women ; and Mrs . Weston must not speak of it again .
Look at her .
We explored to King ' s - Weston twice last summer , in that way , most delightfully , just after their first having the barouche - landau .
" I think her all you describe .
Young ladies should take care of themselves .-- Young ladies are delicate plants .
" Upon my word !
I shall certainly be at leisure ."
" I shall never let that book go out of my own hands ," said she .
Frank was standing by her , but not steadily ; there was a restlessness , which shewed a mind not at ease .
" Jane , Jane , my dear Jane , where are you ?-- Here is your tippet .
" Oh !
Her spirits seemed overcome .
In short , I can feel no dependence on his coming , and I wish Mr . Weston were less sanguine ."
We had great amusement with those letters one morning .
" Upon my word it is , Miss Bates .-- He really is engaged from morning to night .-- There is no end of people ' s coming to him , on some pretence or other .-- The magistrates , and overseers , and churchwardens , are always wanting his opinion .
" Very true , my love , very true .
Only half an hour before her friend called for her at Mrs . Goddard ' s , her evil stars had led her to the very spot where , at that moment , a trunk , directed to _The_ _Rev . _ _Philip_ _Elton_ , _White - Hart_ , _Bath_ , was to be seen under the operation of being lifted into the butcher ' s cart , which was to convey it to where the coaches past ; and every thing in this world , excepting that trunk and the direction , was consequently a blank .
" Mr . Elton , this is the most extraordinary conduct !
I say , sir ," turning to Mr . Woodhouse , " I think there are few places with such society as Highbury .
Maple Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be -- for we do not at all affect to equal my brother , Mr . Suckling , in income .-- However , my resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax .-- I shall certainly have her very often at my house , shall introduce her wherever I can , shall have musical parties to draw out her talents , and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation .
It did , however .-- Her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so sudden a journey , and his fears that Mr . Elton might never get safely to the end of it , and saw nothing extraordinary in his language .
But she had not been there two minutes when she found that Harriet ' s habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too , and that , in short , they would both be soon after her .
Poor girl !
" On your side , my love , it was very innocently done .
A very few days had passed after this adventure , when Harriet came one morning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand , and after sitting down and hesitating , thus began :
Its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind -- and it must be saving her from the danger of degradation .
She felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis , an event , a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state .
I am sure we do .
This is all that I can relate of the how , where , and when .
The affection of the whole family , the warm attachment of Miss Campbell in particular , was the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of Jane ' s decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements .
" I see what a life I am to lead among you .
I do not pretend to Emma ' s genius for foretelling and guessing .
" It is to be a secret , I conclude ," said he .
Living constantly with right - minded and well - informed people , her heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline and culture ; and Colonel Campbell ' s residence being in London , every lighter talent had been done full justice to , by the attendance of first - rate masters .
What am I to do ?"
After being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from Mr . and Mrs . Suckling , the Highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn .
Do not you see that , at this instant , the very passage of her own letter , which sent me the report , is passing under her eye -- that the whole blunder is spread before her -- that she can attend to nothing else , though pretending to listen to the others ?"
actually resolve to break with him entirely !-- She felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each -- she dissolved it .-- What a view this gives of her sense of his behaviour !-- Well , he must be a most extraordinary --"
Frank Churchill ' s little inclination to exclude himself increased so much , that his last words to Emma were ,
So seldom that a letter , among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom , is even carried wrong -- and not one in a million , I suppose , actually lost !
Knightley and Harriet Smith !-- Such an elevation on her side !
" No , indeed , I shall grant you nothing .
She could not but hear ; she could not avoid answering ,
Every body must have seen the snow coming on .
I wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings .
He was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing else -- which is just as it should be , for a thriving man .
The power of observation would be soon given -- frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in one course .
But you really frightened me .
" As to the circumstances of her birth , though in a legal sense she may be called Nobody , it will not hold in common sense .
In this state Frank Churchill had found her , she trembling and conditioning , they loud and insolent .
They should take care of their health and their complexion .
She had herself been first with him for many years past .
She doubted whether she had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman , in betraying her suspicions of Jane Fairfax ' s feelings to Frank Churchill .
Her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits , inconsistency of action , and inequality of powers ; and it mortified her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling , or esteemed so little worthy as a friend : but she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good , and of being able to say to herself , that could Mr . Knightley have been privy to all her attempts of assisting Jane Fairfax , could he even have seen into her heart , he would not , on this occasion , have found any thing to reprove .
The ground covered with snow , and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw , which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise , every morning beginning in rain or snow , and every evening setting in to freeze , she was for many days a most honourable prisoner .
I believe it is the only way that Mr . Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome .
" I must have asked Miss Fairfax , and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me , after your ' s ."
But " she could never get acquainted with her : she did not know how it was , but there was such coldness and reserve -- such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not -- and then , her aunt was such an eternal talker !-- and she was made such a fuss with by every body !-- and it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate -- because their ages were the same , every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other ."
You do not think I could mean _you_ , or suppose Mr . Knightley to mean _you_ .
She might assist his resolution , or reconcile him to it ; she might give just praise to Harriet , or , by representing to him his own independence , relieve him from that state of indecision , which must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his .-- They had reached the house .
It has hurt his father equally .
" Mr . Elton ' s manners are not perfect ," replied Emma ; " but where there is a wish to please , one ought to overlook , and one does overlook a great deal .
