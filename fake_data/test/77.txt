" Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed ," cried Emma .
The unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by Elizabeth Martin ' s calling at Mrs . Goddard ' s a few days afterwards .
You understand every thing .
Miss Woodhouse , I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball .
" Oh !
The appearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight ; and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart , and the solicitude of Mrs . Elton to have _her_ carriage first , were gladly endured , in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure .
Where a man does his best with only moderate powers , he will have the advantage over negligent superiority .
What is before me , I see .
Mr . Weston was a great favourite , and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserve , as to his wife ; not any one , to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and understood , of being always interesting and always intelligible , the little affairs , arrangements , perplexities , and pleasures of her father and herself .
.
I am tired of doing nothing .
He was invited on good faith .
How could you suppose me ignorant ?
" If you were never particularly struck by her manners before ," said she , " I think you will to - day .
We will not be severe ."
"' Tis twelve ; I shall not forget to think of you four hours hence ; and by this time to - morrow , perhaps , or a little later , I may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here .
I am sure Mr . Elton will lose no time in calling on him ; and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage ."
" What do you say to Mrs .
Mr . Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser , and she knew Mr . Elton looked up to him .
Emma was gratified , to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character , and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance .
It has been completely unexpected .
He talked of Harriet , and praised her so warmly , that she could not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add .
Once , I felt the fire rather too much ; but then I moved back my chair a little , a very little , and it did not disturb me .
It was a happy circumstance , and animated Mr . Woodhouse for some time .
My greatest danger , perhaps , in housekeeping , may be quite the other way , in doing too much , and being too careless of expense .
She has talked of it since .
He came to speak to his father on a subject ,-- to announce an attachment --"
Knightley is quite the gentleman .
She inherits her mother ' s talents , and must have been under subjection to her ."
CHAPTER XIV
" I was with Mr . Cole on business an hour and a half ago .
He was not calm ; his spirits were evidently fluttered ; there was restlessness about him .
It was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this assertion ; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again .
However , this does make a difference ; and , perhaps , when we come to talk it over -- but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration .
Weston .-- " Very well , I thank you , ma ' am .
Mr . and Mrs . John Knightley were to come down in August , and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back .
Dixon !"
` Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself !'
Miss Bates ' s powerful , argumentative mind might have strengthened yours ."
But as to my _letting_ her marry Robert Martin , it is impossible ; she has refused him , and so decidedly , I think , as must prevent any second application .
She had been decided in wishing for a Miss Weston .
" Indeed !"
I never knew days fly so fast .
" We shall never agree about him ," cried Emma ; " but that is nothing extraordinary .
" You are ungrateful ."
That is a great thing .
.
Mrs . Elton ' s resources were inadequate to such an attack .
But at last there seemed a perverse turn ; it seemed all at once as if he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account , than on Harriet ' s -- more anxious that she should escape the infection , than that there should be no infection in the complaint .
" Our little friend Harriet Smith , however , is just such another pretty kind of young person .
Your resolution , or rather your expectation of never marrying , results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer , would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you .
Am I to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss Smith ?-- that you have never thought seriously of her ?"
I will attack them with more address .
there he is .
" Oh !
" Dirty , sir !
" Very true ," he gravely replied ; " it was very bad ."
But she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he had done , of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree .
I never knew days fly so fast .
I have been silent from surprize merely , excessive surprize .
The sitting was altogether very satisfactory ; she was quite enough pleased with the first day ' s sketch to wish to go on .
` Oh !'
If she were to meet Miss Bates in her way !-- and upon its beginning to rain , Emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be detaining her at Mrs . Goddard ' s , and that the intelligence would undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation .
Her Bath habits made evening - parties perfectly natural to her , and Maple Grove had given her a taste for dinners .
My dear Emma , suppose we all have a little gruel ."
Two such could never be granted .
I had a letter from him this morning , and he will be with us within a fortnight ."
Mrs . Weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage ; and neither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded at supper .
Do not we rather surpass your expectations ?
" I wish ," said Mrs . Weston , " one could know which arrangement our guests in general would like best .
I hope you will think better of their looks to - morrow ; for I assure you Mr . Wingfield told me , that he did not believe he had ever sent us off altogether , in such good case .
Alas !
Upon the whole , Emma left her with such softened , charitable feelings , as made her look around in walking home , and lament that Highbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence ; nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her .
Let every body on the Hill hear me if they can .
The pleasure is not enhanced , and the inconvenience is often considerable .
" He had better not be in a hurry .
He gave her to understand that Frank admired her extremely -- thought her very beautiful and very charming ; and with so much to be said for him altogether , she found she must not judge him harshly .
It may be possible to do without dancing entirely .
She will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her home .
You have drawn two pretty pictures ; but I think there may be a third -- a something between the do - nothing and the do - all .
" This is coming as you should do ," said she ; " like a gentleman .-- I am quite glad to see you ."
I am very fond of hearing Miss Bates talk .
As it was , I was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit .
To know that he has not thrown himself away , is such a comfort !-- She does seem a charming young woman , just what he deserves .
He had a comfortable home for her , and Emma imagined a very sufficient income ; for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large , he was known to have some independent property ; and she thought very highly of him as a good - humoured , well - meaning , respectable young man , without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world .
We were just in time ; my mother just ready for us .
Harriet ' s sweet easy temper will not mind it ."
I think it would be much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer , and take their tea with us -- take us in their afternoon walk ; which they might do , as our hours are so reasonable , and yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening .
Poor Mr . Woodhouse was silent from consternation ; but every body else had something to say ; every body was either surprized or not surprized , and had some question to ask , or some comfort to offer .
It seemed quite a shame , especially considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away .
my dear sir , how are you this morning ?
They did as they were desired ; and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot , she had the comfort of farther delay in her power , being overtaken by a child from the cottage , setting out , according to orders , with her pitcher , to fetch broth from Hartfield .
But colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn .
Nonsense !
As to her illness , all nothing of course .
Better than nearer !
A complete change of life became desirable .
Another accidental meeting with the Martins was possible , and in her present state , would be dangerous .
" I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him ."
" I told you yesterday ," cried Mr . Weston with exultation , " I told you all that he would be here before the time named .
