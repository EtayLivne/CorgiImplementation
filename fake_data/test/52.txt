There was no comfort in having him in London ; he might as well be at Enscombe ; but Richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse .
" Excuse me , ma ' am , but this is by no means my intention ; I make no inquiry myself , and should be sorry to have any made by my friends .
" This would soon have led to something better , of course ," was her consoling reflection ; " any thing interests between those who love ; and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart .
But what is the meaning of this ?
She was rather low all the evening , but Emma could allow for her amiable regrets , and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection , sometimes by bringing forward the idea of Mr . Elton .
_He_ had done it .
" Engaged since October ,-- secretly engaged .-- It has hurt me , Emma , very much .
" This is very true ," said she , " at least as far as relates to me , which was all that was meant -- and it is very shameful .-- Of the same age -- and always knowing her -- I ought to have been more her friend .-- She will never like me now .
convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about Hartfield .
_Now_ , he said , he was beginning to have no longer the same wish .
" A material difference then ," she replied --" and no doubt you were much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives ; but does not the lapse of one - and - twenty years bring our understandings a good deal nearer ?"
Mr . Frank Churchill did not come .
But she is really quite the gentlewoman ."
If there had not been so much anger , there would have been desperate awkwardness ; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment .
" Well , go on ."
" Indifferent !
This wretched note was the finale of Emma ' s breakfast .
He was dining with the Randalls family , and Jane , at the Eltons '; and he had seen a look , more than a single look , at Miss Fairfax , which , from the admirer of Miss Woodhouse , seemed somewhat out of place .
" My dear papa , I sent the whole hind - quarter .
As a counsellor she was not wanted ; but as an approver , ( a much safer character ,) she was truly welcome .
But now , poor girl , her peace is cut up for some time .
Harriet listened , and Emma drew in peace .
" I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy ," said Mr . Knightley presently , " though I have kept my thoughts to myself ; but I now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet .
had been a question of his .
" I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr . Elton .
" Pretty well , my dear -- I hope -- pretty well .-- I do not know but that the place agrees with her tolerably ."
" Indeed , Harriet , it would have been a severe pang to lose you ; but it must have been .
It was well that he took every body ' s joy for granted , or he might not have thought either Mr . Woodhouse or Mr . Knightley particularly delighted .
Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell .
Respect would be added to affection .
The idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse , whom she really loved extremely , made her wretched for a while , and when the violence of grief was comforted away , still remained powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it very tolerably .
Let her marry Robert Martin , and she is safe , respectable , and happy for ever ; but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly , and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune , she may be a parlour - boarder at Mrs . Goddard ' s all the rest of her life -- or , at least , ( for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other ,) till she grow desperate , and is glad to catch at the old writing - master ' s son ."
My heart was in Highbury , and my business was to get my body thither as often as might be , and with the least suspicion .
-- Those were the words ; in them lay the tormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of , and which constituted the real misery of the business to her .
I heard a good deal of Colonel Campbell ' s taste at Weymouth ; and the softness of the upper notes I am sure is exactly what he and _all_ _that_ _party_ would particularly prize .
And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my three turns -- my winter walk ."
_I_ think seriously of Miss Smith !-- Miss Smith is a very good sort of girl ; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled .
I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly what every man delights in -- what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment .
" Yes ," said he , smiling --" and reason good .
To her he looked for comfort ; and her assurances of safety , her representation of the excellence of the horses , and of James , and of their having so many friends about them , revived him a little .
My mother does not hear ; she is a little deaf you know .
She was the first to announce it to Mr . Knightley ; and exclaimed quite as much as was necessary , ( or , being acting a part , perhaps rather more ,) at the conduct of the Churchills , in keeping him away .
.
It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home ; and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society or other , it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house , too wise to stir out ; and to hear him say to Mr . Knightley , whom no weather could keep entirely from them ,--
He came back gay and self - satisfied , eager and busy , caring nothing for Miss Woodhouse , and defying Miss Smith .
It was by no means his daughter ' s wish that the intellects of Highbury in general should be put under requisition .
If it were to be shared with the woman he loved , he could not think any man to be pitied for having that house .
He had been detained by a temporary increase of illness in her ; a nervous seizure , which had lasted some hours -- and he had quite given up every thought of coming , till very late ;-- and had he known how hot a ride he should have , and how late , with all his hurry , he must be , he believed he should not have come at all .
Dear Harriet !-- I would not change you for the clearest - headed , longest - sighted , best - judging female breathing .
" Much , indeed !"
" Whatever you say is always right ," cried Harriet , " and therefore I suppose , and believe , and hope it must be so ; but otherwise I could not have imagined it .
She will be disagreeable in infancy , and correct herself as she grows older .
Mr . Weston is really as kind as herself .
The Coles expressed themselves so properly -- there was so much real attention in the manner of it -- so much consideration for her father .
The gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice ; they took themselves off in a hurry .
I cannot imagine that she will not be continually insulting her visitor with praise , encouragement , and offers of service ; that she will not be continually detailing her magnificent intentions , from the procuring her a permanent situation to the including her in those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche - landau ."
And at last , as if resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object , he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person .
She is always so attentive to them !"
There could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs . John Knightley , in this short visit to Hartfield , going about every morning among her old acquaintance with her five children , and talking over what she had done every evening with her father and sister .
He was coming through the hall .
Jane often says , when she is here , ` I am sure , grandmama , you must have had very strong eyes to see as you do -- and so much fine work as you have done too !-- I only wish my eyes may last me as well .'"
After these came a second set ; among the most come - at - able of whom were Mrs . and Miss Bates , and Mrs . Goddard , three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield , and who were fetched and carried home so often , that Mr . Woodhouse thought it no hardship for either James or the horses .
WINDSOR - JULY .
It would amuse away the difficulties of her part , and lessen the irksomeness of Miss Smith ' s ."
.
only think .
the letter had much better be all your own .
no , no , no -- how can you suspect me of such a thing ?
" Did she know ?-- had she heard any thing about her , since their being at Randalls ?-- he felt much anxiety -- he must confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably ."
" And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking ?"
I never hear better sense from any one than Robert Martin .
I have heard him say that he could listen to her for ever .
He was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion , by giving her very proper attention , after the introduction had passed .
" I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man .
" I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother ," cried Emma , " about your friend Mr . Graham ' s intending to have a bailiff from Scotland , to look after his new estate .
You seem shut out from every thing -- in the most complete retirement .-- And Mrs . Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion .
Can the old lady ?"
can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from Harriet to me ?-- Absurd and insufferable !"
" If I can come again , we are still to have our ball .
Or , perhaps she may not have resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life .
There must be three months , at least , of deep mourning ; but when they are over , I imagine there will be nothing more to wait for ."
It did her no service however .
The wedding was very much like other weddings , where the parties have no taste for finery or parade ; and Mrs . Elton , from the particulars detailed by her husband , thought it all extremely shabby , and very inferior to her own .--" Very little white satin , very few lace veils ; a most pitiful business !-- Selina would stare when she heard of it ."
Elton is a very good sort of man , and a very respectable vicar of Highbury , but not at all likely to make an imprudent match .
For Miss ----------, read Miss Smith .
Elton ."
" No , indeed you are mistaken ."
" No , no , not at all -- only a little agitated .
Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech , and saw no alarming symptoms of love .
No , I would not be the means of giving them any pain .
Martin !"
" Ah !"
_She_ certainly had not been in the wrong , and _he_ would never own that he had .
" Oh !
Miss Woodhouse , do talk to me and make me comfortable again ."
Another slice of cold meat , another draught of Madeira and water , will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us ."
The distressing explanation she had to make to Harriet , and all that poor Harriet would be suffering , with the awkwardness of future meetings , the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance , of subduing feelings , concealing resentment , and avoiding eclat , were enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections some time longer , and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most dreadfully .
Is it necessary for me to use any roundabout phrase ?-- Your Yorkshire friend -- your correspondent in Yorkshire ;-- that would be the way , I suppose , if I were very bad .-- No , I can pronounce his name without the smallest distress .
She must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction ."
" A man ," said he , " must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks people to leave their own fireside , and encounter such a day as this , for the sake of coming to see him .
