snows a little I see ."
The weather added what it could of gloom .
said Emma , as soon as she could speak .
Here ceased the concert part of the evening , for Miss Woodhouse and Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers ; but soon ( within five minutes ) the proposal of dancing -- originating nobody exactly knew where -- was so effectually promoted by Mr . and Mrs . Cole , that every thing was rapidly clearing away , to give proper space .
Miss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly new this circumstance was to her ; but as without supposing it possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars of Mr . Frank Churchill ' s going , she proceeded to give them all , it was of no consequence .
" What was I talking of ?"
The youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy , and of powerful operation ; and if the distress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed , they will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope .
He had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her some walnuts , because she had said how fond she was of them , and in every thing else he was so very obliging .
This is feeling your way .
Your inexperience really amuses me !
Martin ?"
" I saw her answer !-- nothing could be clearer ."
" Well , I believe , if you will excuse me , Mr . Knightley , if you will not consider me as doing a very rude thing , I shall take Emma ' s advice and go out for a quarter of an hour .
He had , in fact , been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence .
He was not exactly what she had expected ; less of the man of the world in some of his notions , less of the spoiled child of fortune , therefore better than she had expected .
` Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself !'
It opens his designs to his family , it introduces you among them , it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature , eager curiosity and warm prepossession .
She then broke the lace off short , and dexterously throwing it into a ditch , was presently obliged to entreat them to stop , and acknowledged her inability to put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort .
" Very true ," he gravely replied ; " it was very bad ."
One cannot have too large a party .
" My father tried it more than once , formerly ; but without receiving any benefit ; and Mr . Perry , whose name , I dare say , is not unknown to you , does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now ."
The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove , " My brother Mr . Suckling ' s seat ;"-- a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove .
The next remove was to the house ; they must all go in and eat ;-- and they were all seated and busy , and still Frank Churchill did not come .
How improperly had she been acting by Harriet !
While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to myself , but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation in approving .
Consider from how partial a quarter your information came .
Upon the whole , she was equally contented with her view of his feelings .
You may believe me , Mrs . Weston .
For Mrs . Weston there was nothing to be done ; for Harriet every thing .
She knew that at times she must be missed ; and could not think , without pain , of Emma ' s losing a single pleasure , or suffering an hour ' s ennui , from the want of her companionableness : but dear Emma was of no feeble character ; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been , and had sense , and energy , and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations .
Only three of us .-- besides dear Jane at present -- and she really eats nothing -- makes such a shocking breakfast , you would be quite frightened if you saw it .
Why should not they explore to Box Hill though the Sucklings did not come ?
I knew it was -- but had not resolution enough to part with them ."
.
Frank turned instantly to Emma , to claim her former promise ; and boasted himself an engaged man , which his father looked his most perfect approbation of -- and it then appeared that Mrs . Weston was wanting _him_ to dance with Mrs . Elton himself , and that their business was to help to persuade him into it , which was done pretty soon .-- Mr . Weston and Mrs . Elton led the way , Mr . Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed .
What arises from discretion must be honoured ."
He gave her to understand that Frank admired her extremely -- thought her very beautiful and very charming ; and with so much to be said for him altogether , she found she must not judge him harshly .
" It is so , indeed ," continued Mr . Knightley ; " I have it from Robert Martin himself .
" Mr . Weston do not trifle with me .-- Consider how many of my dearest friends are now in Brunswick Square .
In this state of schemes , and hopes , and connivance , June opened upon Hartfield .
Emma , on reaching home , called the housekeeper directly , to an examination of her stores ; and some arrowroot of very superior quality was speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note .
And woman , lovely woman , reigns alone .
She had a little beauty and a little accomplishment , but so little judgment that she thought herself coming with superior knowledge of the world , to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood ; and conceived Miss Hawkins to have held such a place in society as Mrs . Elton ' s consequence only could surpass .
--" The best of all .
And Mr . Weston at the same time , walking briskly with long steps through the passage , was calling out ,
I hope they are quite well .
" It was her very particular friend , you know ."
" Certainly ," replied he , surprized , " I do not absolutely know it ; but it may be inferred .
He called her ` Augusta .'
" Here is something quite new to me .
She must tell you herself what she is -- yet not by word , for never was there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her own merit .-- Since I began this letter , which will be longer than I foresaw , I have heard from her .-- She gives a good account of her own health ; but as she never complains , I dare not depend .
She would not have been puzzled , had she dared fix on them .
.
He knew of no one but Mrs . Goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or friends .
Knightley ' s .-- Alas !
Was not she like a daughter , his eldest daughter ?-- he must tell her ; and Miss Bates being present , it passed , of course , to Mrs . Cole , Mrs . Perry , and Mrs . Elton , immediately afterwards .
There she is -- no , that ' s somebody else .
" True , true ," he answered , warmly .
I saw her as I came in ; she was standing in the entrance .
It was a concern which brought just employment enough .
Mrs . Weston , kind - hearted and musical , was particularly interested by the circumstance , and Emma could not help being amused at her perseverance in dwelling on the subject ; and having so much to ask and to say as to tone , touch , and pedal , totally unsuspicious of that wish of saying as little about it as possible , which she plainly read in the fair heroine ' s countenance .
.
Receive it on my judgment .
They arrived , the carriage turned , the step was let down , and Mr . Elton , spruce , black , and smiling , was with them instantly .
" We have been calling at Randalls ," said she , " and found them both at home ; and very pleasant people they seem to be .
" I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of .-- Oh !
Do not forget your engagement ."
cried Emma , shaking her head .--" Ah !
" Yes -- it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill - humour of Mrs . Churchill , which I imagine to be the most certain thing in the world ."
" Do you know Miss Bates ' s niece ?
" No great variety of faces for you ," said Emma .
You were very popular before you came , because you were Mr . Weston ' s son -- but lay out half a guinea at Ford ' s , and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues ."
He has a wife and family to maintain , and is not to be giving away his time .
The gentlemen spoke of his horse .
" We consider our Hartfield pork ," replied Mr . Woodhouse --" indeed it certainly is , so very superior to all other pork , that Emma and I cannot have a greater pleasure than --"
The longer she considered it , the greater was her sense of its expediency .
" Depend upon it , Emma , a sensible man would find no difficulty in it .
And I know he has read the Vicar of Wakefield .
-- And Emma distinctly heard him add , in a lower tone , before he quitted the room ,--" I have been as good as my word .
" One ought to use the same caution , perhaps , in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family ; but Enscombe , I believe , certainly must not be judged by general rules : _she_ is so very unreasonable ; and every thing gives way to her ."
I am sorry Mr . and Mrs . Cole should have done it .
.
She will be disagreeable in infancy , and correct herself as she grows older .
Why was the evil so dreadfully increased by Harriet ' s having some hope of a return ?
I was a kinder friend than you deserved .
" Sir ," said Mr . Woodhouse , rather warmly , " you are very much mistaken if you suppose Mr . Perry to be that sort of character .
" Oh !
We must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax ."
Where shall we see a better daughter , or a kinder sister , or a truer friend ?
" What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be !
She had led her friend astray , and it would be a reproach to her for ever ; but her judgment was as strong as her feelings , and as strong as it had ever been before , in reprobating any such alliance for him , as most unequal and degrading .
Though I think he had better not have married .
I feel a strong persuasion , this morning , that I shall soon be abroad .
Mr . John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure , but said only , coolly ,
" Why , pretty well , my dear , upon the whole .
You would have thrown yourself out of all good society .
" Yes , certainly it does .
" My dearest Harriet !"
" Oh !
You must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other .
