He came four times a day for a week .
I believe I was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper ."
It was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece of news , as proving that Mr . Elton could not have suffered long ; but she was sorry for Harriet : Harriet must feel it -- and all that she could hope was , by giving the first information herself , to save her from hearing it abruptly from others .
" I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love ."
" And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her !
aye , I know your scruples .
A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked , or because he is attached to her , and can write a tolerable letter ."
In her letters I shall be at dear Highbury again ."
Emma felt that Mrs . Weston was giving her a momentary glance ; and she was herself struck by his warmth .
But I have done with expecting any course of steady reading from Emma .
It depends entirely upon his aunt ' s spirits and pleasure ; in short , upon her temper .
" My Emma , he means no such thing .
" I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man .
From Frank Churchill ' s face , where he thought he saw confusion suppressed or laughed away , he had involuntarily turned to hers ; but she was indeed behind , and too busy with her shawl .
" But , Mr . Knightley , she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor , and I am sure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for ."
" We think so very differently on this point , Mr . Knightley , that there can be no use in canvassing it .
But take it away , and all _appropriation_ ceases , and a very pretty gallant charade remains , fit for any collection .
It was not lost on me .
Elton .-- She looked round for a moment ; he had joined Mr . Knightley at a little distance , and was arranging himself for settled conversation , while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife .
She felt immediately that she should like him ; and there was a well - bred ease of manner , and a readiness to talk , which convinced her that he came intending to be acquainted with her , and that acquainted they soon must be .
" I must spend some time with them ; I am sure they will want it ;-- afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself .
The friends from whom she had just parted , though very good sort of people , must be doing her harm .
Her congratulations were warm and open ; but Emma could not speak so fluently .
It crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend ' s leaving Highbury , for the sake of her being settled so well .
" Will you read the letter ?"
Nothing to signify .
Fortunately for him , Highbury , including Randalls in the same parish , and Donwell Abbey in the parish adjoining , the seat of Mr . Knightley , comprehended many such .
Mr . Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way .
No husbands and wives ," with so interesting a consciousness , that Emma began to consider whether she had not better leave them together at once .
Never better .-- Don ' t I hear another carriage ?-- Who can this be ?-- very likely the worthy Coles .-- Upon my word , this is charming to be standing about among such friends !
As he became rational , he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in their authority .
He cannot want money -- he cannot want leisure .
Mrs . Weston was exceedingly disappointed -- much more disappointed , in fact , than her husband , though her dependence on seeing the young man had been so much more sober : but a sanguine temper , though for ever expecting more good than occurs , does not always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression .
Perry ' s setting up his carriage !
" No , no ,"-- he gravely replied .--" Don ' t ask me .
Command yourself enough to say no more , and I will endeavour to forget it ."
The pleasantness of the morning had induced him to walk forward , and leave his horses to meet him by another road , a mile or two beyond Highbury -- and happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before of Miss Bates , and to have forgotten to restore them , he had been obliged to stop at her door , and go in for a few minutes : he was therefore later than he had intended ; and being on foot , was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them .
His good sense and good principles would delight you .-- As far as the man is concerned , you could not wish your friend in better hands .
He stopped .-- Emma felt her foot pressed by Mrs . Weston , and did not herself know what to think .
Emma and Harriet were going to walk ; he joined them ; and , on returning , they fell in with a larger party , who , like themselves , judged it wisest to take their exercise early , as the weather threatened rain ; Mr . and Mrs . Weston and their son , Miss Bates and her niece , who had accidentally met .
For the present , he could not be spared , to his " very great mortification and regret ; but still he looked forward with the hope of coming to Randalls at no distant period ."
I think it is the state of mind which gives most spirit and delight .
The day came , the party were punctually assembled , and Mr . John Knightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable .
The very next day however produced some proof of inspiration .
Let every body on the Hill hear me if they can .
She paused over it , while Harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion , with a " Well , well ," and was at last forced to add , " Is it a good letter ?
Bought at Weymouth , you know -- Mr . Dixon ' s choice .
" Yes , yes , pray pass _me_ ," added her husband , with a sort of sneering consciousness ; " _I_ have nothing to say that can entertain Miss Woodhouse , or any other young lady .
Captain Weston , who had been considered , especially by the Churchills , as making such an amazing match , was proved to have much the worst of the bargain ; for when his wife died , after a three years ' marriage , he was rather a poorer man than at first , and with a child to maintain .
" Never , never !"
" Her friends must all be sorry to lose her ; and will not Colonel and Mrs . Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their return ?"
dear Mrs . Elton , so obliged to you for the carriage !-- excellent time .
" And the staircase -- You know , as I came in , I observed how very like the staircase was ; placed exactly in the same part of the house .
.
Besides , she is out of health now ; but _that_ indeed , by her own account , she has always been .
" Pretty well , my dear -- I hope -- pretty well .-- I do not know but that the place agrees with her tolerably ."
" Aye , do , Frank .-- Go and fetch Miss Bates , and let us end the matter at once .
Mr . Weston was musing .
This , Emma could not doubt , was all for herself .
My brother and sister will be enchanted with this place .
The children are all fond of him ."
Knightley ."
You should not have done it , indeed you should not .
The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square is very different from almost all the rest .
And as to smaller - sized rooms than I had been used to , I really could not give it a thought .
Harriet was too much agitated to encounter him .
They were now approaching the cottage , and all idle topics were superseded .
These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able to collect ; and happy was she , for her father ' s sake , in the power ; though , as far as she was herself concerned , it was no remedy for the absence of Mrs . Weston .
-- thought Emma .--" You have not deserved this .
Two such she did not want .
It need not detain us long .
Emma saw Mrs . Weston ' s surprize , and felt that it must be great , at an address which , in words and manner , was assuming to himself the right of first interest in her ; and as for herself , she was too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose .
Without knowing when the carriage turned into Vicarage Lane , or when it stopped , they found themselves , all at once , at the door of his house ; and he was out before another syllable passed .-- Emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good night .
The heat was excessive ; he had never suffered any thing like it -- almost wished he had staid at home -- nothing killed him like heat -- he could bear any degree of cold , etc ., but heat was intolerable -- and he sat down , at the greatest possible distance from the slight remains of Mr . Woodhouse ' s fire , looking very deplorable .
I could never hope to equal my own doings at Randalls .
She could then see more and judge better .
" So very obliging of you !-- No rain at all .
" Jane , Jane , my dear Jane , where are you ?-- Here is your tippet .
She did not mean to have her own affections entangled again , and it would be incumbent on her to avoid any encouragement of his .
At first , she thought it was a good deal ; and afterwards , but little .
" Oh no !
From the expense of the child , however , he was soon relieved .
I must order the carriage .
there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort .
I shall see you at the Abbey to - morrow morning I hope , and then we will look them over , and you shall give me your opinion ."
Heaven forbid !
I shall always have a great regard for the Miss Martins , especially Elizabeth , and should be very sorry to give them up , for they are quite as well educated as me .
Little things do not irritate him .
Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell .
" I like your plan ," cried Mr . Weston .
This discovery laid many smaller matters open .
" Indeed , the truth was , that poor dear Jane could not bear to see any body -- any body at all -- Mrs . Elton , indeed , could not be denied -- and Mrs . Cole had made such a point -- and Mrs . Perry had said so much -- but , except them , Jane would really see nobody ."
Something really important seemed announced by his looks ; but , as her friend was well , she endeavoured not to be uneasy , and settling it with her father , that she would take her walk now , she and Mr . Weston were soon out of the house together and on their way at a quick pace for Randalls .
" Indeed , Harriet , it would have been a severe pang to lose you ; but it must have been .
I could not bear to have Henry supplanted .-- Mr . Knightley marry !-- No , I have never had such an idea , and I cannot adopt it now .
She paused a few moments .
It was a very useful note , for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening .
" You are speaking of letters of business ; mine are letters of friendship ."
Am I to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss Smith ?-- that you have never thought seriously of her ?"
And soon afterwards , " Jane Fairfax is a very charming young woman -- but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect .
