" No , it by no means wanted strength -- it was not a large hand , but very clear and certainly strong .
One of those points on which his influence failed , he then mentioned .
A Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on that passage ."
Harriet , she found , had never in her life been within side the Vicarage , and her curiosity to see it was so extreme , that , considering exteriors and probabilities , Emma could only class it , as a proof of love , with Mr . Elton ' s seeing ready wit in her .
Mrs . Elton ' s invitations I should have imagined any thing but inviting ."
We are rather out of distance of the very striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of ; and we are a very quiet set of people , I believe ; more disposed to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure ."
While they are with us , we shall explore a great deal , I dare say .
It would be almost beginning their life of civility again .
The thing is determined , that is ( laughing affectedly ) as far as I can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master .
So very good of them to send her the whole way !
" I do not know .
There is safety in reserve , but no attraction .
" Yes , sir , I did indeed ; and I am very much obliged by your kind solicitude about me ."
" That is very likely .
Excepting inequality of fortune , and perhaps a little disparity of age , I can see nothing unsuitable ."
You know nothing of drawing .
It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his schemes ; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth , it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase Randalls , and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to ; but he had gone steadily on , with these objects in view , till they were accomplished .
" I do not know which it ought to be called ."
I assured him that I could not .
" How odd you are !
Emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting .
But , unfortunately -- in short , if your compassion does not stand my friend --"
Of course , he must be sorry to lose her -- they must be all sorry .
It would be incompatible with what she owed to her father , and with what she felt for him .
After tea , Mr . and Mrs . Weston , and Mr . Elton sat down with Mr . Woodhouse to cards .
Jane said so .
She hesitated a moment , and then replied , " With you , if you will ask me ."
I am sure Mr . Elton will lose no time in calling on him ; and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him at the Vicarage ."
How inconsiderate , how indelicate , how irrational , how unfeeling had been her conduct !
While he staid , the Martins were forgotten ; and on the very morning of his setting off for Bath again , Emma , to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned , judged it best for her to return Elizabeth Martin ' s visit .
" Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she would like to hear what we are all thinking of ?"
By your account , he does seem to have had some scruples .
Mrs . Weston was disengaged and Emma began again --" Mr . Frank Churchill writes one of the best gentleman ' s hands I ever saw ."
Emma was almost too much astonished to answer ; but Mrs . Elton hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on .
If not wise or refined herself , she would have connected him with those who were ; but Miss Hawkins , it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit , had been the best of her own set .
evil to some is always good to others .
Mrs . Perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage , and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed .
Now , however , I see nothing in it but a very natural and consistent degree of discretion .
" Or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument -- which must now be shut up in London , untouched by any body ."
We shall be most happy to consider you as one of the party ."
No indeed !-- There was not a hint of Mr . Martin .
Had you not been surrounded by other friends , I might have been tempted to introduce a subject , to ask questions , to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct .-- I feel that I should certainly have been impertinent ."
Happy those , who can remain at Highbury !"
To him who has , it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence , and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought .
" I am very much astonished , Mr . Elton .
She had never seen Frank Churchill so silent and stupid .
Think , then , what I must have endured in hearing it bandied between the Eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition , and all the insolence of imaginary superiority .
Maple Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be -- for we do not at all affect to equal my brother , Mr . Suckling , in income .-- However , my resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax .-- I shall certainly have her very often at my house , shall introduce her wherever I can , shall have musical parties to draw out her talents , and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation .
There can be no doubt of your being a gentleman ' s daughter , and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own power , or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you ."
" That may be , and I may have seen him fifty times , but without having any idea of his name .
" Emma ," said Mr . Knightley presently , " I have a piece of news for you .
The introduction must be unpleasant , whenever it takes place ; and the sooner it could be over , the better ."
" I had only my own family to study from .
" But you should tell them of the letter , my dear ," said her father .
" To a Mrs . Smallridge -- charming woman -- most superior -- to have the charge of her three little girls -- delightful children .
At Hartfield , you have had very good specimens of well educated , well bred men .
She thought there was an air of greater happiness than usual -- a glow both of complexion and spirits .
For a few days , every morning visit in Highbury included some mention of the handsome letter Mrs . Weston had received .
" Well ," said Mrs . Weston , smiling , " you give him credit for more simple , disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do ; for while Miss Bates was speaking , a suspicion darted into my head , and I have never been able to get it out again .
Mr . Knightley , I wish you had the benefit of this ; I think this would convince you .
Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin ."
After a mutual silence of some minutes , Harriet thus began again --
A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed , and then , about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage , an old and not very good house , almost as close to the road as it could be .
But in time they will .
Mr . Knightley , who , for some reason best known to himself , had certainly taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill , was only growing to dislike him more .
That he should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before , passed suspiciously through Emma ' s brain ; but still , if it were a falsehood , it was a pleasant one , and pleasantly handled .
The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day .
Their being fixed , so absolutely fixed , in the same place , was bad for each , for all three .
Every body is asleep !"
English verdure , English culture , English comfort , seen under a sun bright , without being oppressive .
I hope you will be pleased with my son ; but you must not expect a prodigy .
Mr . Weston -- ( laughing affectedly ) I must protest against that .-- A most dangerous precedent indeed !-- I beg you will not let your neighbours follow your example .-- Upon my word , if this is what I am to expect , we married women must begin to exert ourselves !-- Oh !
No sooner was she out of sight , than Emma exclaimed ,
But in every respect , as she saw more of her , she approved her , and was confirmed in all her kind designs .
He got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor ' s merits , without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse ' s character , than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor ' s .
My interference was quite as likely to do harm as good .
Her way was clear , though not quite smooth .-- She spoke then , on being so entreated .-- What did she say ?-- Just what she ought , of course .
" I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man .
She was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations , which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length , by the eagerness of Harriet ' s wondering questions .
and it was but yesterday I was telling Mr . Cole , I really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing - room , while I do not know one note from another , and our little girls , who are but just beginning , perhaps may never make any thing of it ; and there is poor Jane Fairfax , who is mistress of music , has not any thing of the nature of an instrument , not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world , to amuse herself with .-- I was saying this to Mr . Cole but yesterday , and he quite agreed with me ; only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase , hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can ; and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought -- or else I am sure we ought to be ashamed of it .-- We are in great hopes that Miss Woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening ."
" No , sir ," cried Emma , " it confesses no such thing .
The carriage was sent for them now .
It was not with Mrs . Suckling , it was not with Mrs . Bragge , but in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them : it was with a cousin of Mrs . Bragge , an acquaintance of Mrs . Suckling , a lady known at Maple Grove .
are you there ?-- But you are miserably behindhand .
Whenever she is with us , Mrs . Cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough ; and I must say that Jane deserves it as much as any body can .
The ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant , " Men never know when things are dirty or not ;" and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to himself , " Women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares ."
Mr . Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it , besides all the history of his own and Isabella ' s coming , and of Emma ' s being to follow , and had indeed just got to the end of his satisfaction that James should come and see his daughter , when the others appeared , and Mrs . Weston , who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him , was able to turn away and welcome her dear Emma .
And it always ended in " Kitty , a fair but frozen maid ."
yes -- but how they were conveyed hither ?-- the manner of their coming ?"
Enscombe is in Yorkshire ?"
Ladies and gentlemen -- I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say , that she waives her right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of , and only requires something very entertaining from each of you , in a general way .
It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his schemes ; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth , it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase Randalls , and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to ; but he had gone steadily on , with these objects in view , till they were accomplished .
Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged -- appetite quite gone -- and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms , nothing touching the pulmonary complaint , which was the standing apprehension of the family , Mr . Perry was uneasy about her .
A thousand vexatious thoughts would recur .
" How very pleasing and proper of him !"
It was quite a chance , he said , that he had not gone round by Randalls .
Mr . Weston -- ( laughing affectedly ) I must protest against that .-- A most dangerous precedent indeed !-- I beg you will not let your neighbours follow your example .-- Upon my word , if this is what I am to expect , we married women must begin to exert ourselves !-- Oh !
" Very like Maple Grove indeed !-- She was quite struck by the likeness !-- That room was the very shape and size of the morning - room at Maple Grove ; her sister ' s favourite room ."
" It is a most repulsive quality , indeed ," said he .
I always say a woman cannot have too many resources -- and I feel very thankful that I have so many myself as to be quite independent of society ."
