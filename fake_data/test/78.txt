She wished him to speak , but he would not .
A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked , or because he is attached to her , and can write a tolerable letter ."
Churchill ."
Late hours do not agree with us .
I like him very much .
You saw her with the Campbells , when she was the equal of every body she mixed with , but here she is with a poor old grandmother , who has barely enough to live on .
" I hope Mrs . Bates and Miss Fairfax are --"
It was very natural for you to say , what right has he to lecture me ?-- and I am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner .
The time of year lightened the evil to him .
" She could not compose herself -- Mr . Woodhouse would be alarmed -- she had better go ;"-- with most ready encouragement from her friend , therefore , she passed off through another door -- and the moment she was gone , this was the spontaneous burst of Emma ' s feelings : " Oh God !
I should not like a man who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning .
" Yes ."
They burst on him , I do not know how , but by some letter or message -- and it was the discovery of what she was doing , of this very project of hers , which determined him to come forward at once , own it all to his uncle , throw himself on his kindness , and , in short , put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been carrying on so long ."
Early , I know , you had none ."
I do not know whether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us , Harriet , by additional softness , but it strikes me that his manners are softer than they used to be .
I always regret excessively on dear Emma ' s account that she cannot be more at Highbury ; but now their daughter is married , I suppose Colonel and Mrs . Campbell will not be able to part with her at all .
It is very good advice , and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often found ; for it shall be attended to ."
His rank in society I would alter if I could , which is saying a great deal I assure you , Emma .-- You laugh at me about William Larkins ; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin ."
."
It was very natural for you to say , what right has he to lecture me ?-- and I am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner .
You really are a very sad girl , and do not know how to take care of yourself .-- To the post - office indeed !
By birth she belonged to Highbury : and when at three years old , on losing her mother , she became the property , the charge , the consolation , the fondling of her grandmother and aunt , there had seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there ; of her being taught only what very limited means could command , and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement , to be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person , good understanding , and warm - hearted , well - meaning relations .
you are too obliging !
But take it away , and all _appropriation_ ceases , and a very pretty gallant charade remains , fit for any collection .
The weather was most favourable for her ; though Christmas Day , she could not go to church .
" Yes ," said Mr . John Knightley presently , with some slyness , " he seems to have a great deal of good - will towards you ."
I wonder which she will think the handsomest , Henry or John ?"
Miss Woodhouse , I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball .
It was not to oblige Jane Fairfax therefore that he would have preferred the society of William Larkins .
I am exceedingly obliged to you , Mrs . Elton , I am obliged to any body who feels for me , but I am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer .
He felt the going away almost too much to speak of it .
She knows their ways best ; but I should not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present .
" Oh !
Mr . Elton must smile less , and Mr . John Knightley more , to fit them for the place .-- Emma only might be as nature prompted , and shew herself just as happy as she was .
I perfectly understand your situation , however , Miss Woodhouse -- ( looking towards Mr . Woodhouse ), Your father ' s state of health must be a great drawback .
With all dear Emma ' s little faults , she is an excellent creature .
Consider from how partial a quarter your information came .
Do you sit where you like ?
Knightley ."
there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort .
She could have made an inquiry or two , as to the expedition and the expense of the Irish mails ;-- it was at her tongue ' s end -- but she abstained .
I am exceedingly sorry : but it is well that the mistake ends where it does .
It will be as clean as Randalls by candlelight .
Are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr . Martin and Harriet now are ?"
It is not every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did , and refuse to take Jane ' s answer ; but she positively declared she would _not_ write any such denial yesterday , as Jane wished her ; she would wait -- and , sure enough , yesterday evening it was all settled that Jane should go .
" You spent the evening with Mrs .
" Quite wrong , my dear aunt ; there is no likeness at all ."
I dare say Mr . Knightley will be so kind as to meet him ."
To be in company , nicely dressed herself and seeing others nicely dressed , to sit and smile and look pretty , and say nothing , was enough for the happiness of the present hour .
" Aye , I wonder which she will .
" That ' s right , my dear , very right .
I wish her extremely well : and , no doubt , there are men who might not object to -- Every body has their level : but as for myself , I am not , I think , quite so much at a loss .
It could not be otherwise .
" And I , Mr . Knightley , am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing them any harm .
I met the letters in my way this morning , and seeing my son ' s hand , presumed to open it -- though it was not directed to me -- it was to Mrs . Weston .
Being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling , I have been in no hurry with my congratulations ; but I hope it all went off tolerably well .
CHAPTER VII
While they are with us , we shall explore a great deal , I dare say .
Mr . Weston must be quiet , and every thing deliberately arranged .
" I have no hesitation in saying ," replied Mr . Elton , though hesitating a good deal while he spoke ; " I have no hesitation in saying -- at least if my friend feels at all as _I_ do -- I have not the smallest doubt that , could he see his little effusion honoured as _I_ see it , ( looking at the book again , and replacing it on the table ), he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life ."
CHAPTER IV
" Is not she looking well ?"
How Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts to Mr .
When people come into a beautiful country of this sort , you know , Miss Woodhouse , one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible ; and Mr . Suckling is extremely fond of exploring .
Her parting look was grateful -- and her parting words , " Oh !
" Such an extraordinary dream of mine !"
I know no man more likely than Mr . Knightley to do the sort of thing -- to do any thing really good - natured , useful , considerate , or benevolent .
She was told that now he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them , almost as often as he could even wish .
very unaccountable !
You are his object -- and you will soon receive the completest proof of it .
of what sort ?"
Concession must be out of the question ; but it was time to appear to forget that they had ever quarrelled ; and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration of friendship , that when he came into the room she had one of the children with her -- the youngest , a nice little girl about eight months old , who was now making her first visit to Hartfield , and very happy to be danced about in her aunt ' s arms .
" But then , to be an old maid at last , like Miss Bates !"
Such schemes as these are nothing without numbers .
What is passable in youth is detestable in later age .
The couplet does not cease to be , nor does its meaning change .
" What does all that signify ?
" I should have been sorry , Mr . Knightley , to be dependent on _your_ recommendation , had I quitted Mr . Woodhouse ' s family and wanted another situation ; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body .
But I will shew her greater attention than I have done ."
and I can account for it only in one way ; you are not yourself , or you could not speak either to me , or of Harriet , in such a manner .
Do not let mine continue longer .
A young lady who faints , must be recovered ; questions must be answered , and surprizes be explained .
Mrs . Weston was disappointed .
" Ah !
No , my dear little modest Harriet , depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond - street till just before he mounts his horse to - morrow .
It was not to oblige Jane Fairfax therefore that he would have preferred the society of William Larkins .
The beginning , however , of every visit displayed none but the properest feelings , and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality .
Here , she must be leading a life of privation and penance ; there it would have been all enjoyment .
I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards myself ; but , otherwise , I should loudly protest against the share of it which that woman has known .-- ` Jane ,' indeed !-- You will observe that I have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name , even to you .
But Mr . Weston is almost an old man .
I see the difference plain enough .
" Yes -- what should hurt me ?-- I walk fast .
She had given them neither men , nor names , nor places , that could raise a blush .
I can understand you --( nodding at Mr . John Knightley )-- your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here , delights you too much to pass unnoticed .
He did not omit being sometimes directly before Miss Smith , or speaking to those who were close to her .-- Emma saw it .
Harriet certainly was not clever , but she had a sweet , docile , grateful disposition , was totally free from conceit , and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to .
" I not aware !"
CHAPTER XIV
I know , indeed , that he is so , and , as such , wish him well .
Jane she had a distinct glimpse of , looking extremely ill ; and , before the door had shut them out , she heard Miss Bates saying , " Well , my dear , I shall _say_ you are laid down upon the bed , and I am sure you are ill enough ."
