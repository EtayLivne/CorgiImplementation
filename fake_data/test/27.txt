And this belief produced another dread .
He stopt again , rose again , and seemed quite embarrassed .-- He was more in love with her than Emma had supposed ; and who can say how it might have ended , if his father had not made his appearance ?
After this speech he was gone as soon as possible .
My playing is no more like her ' s , than a lamp is like sunshine ."
Were you often in the same society ?"
` I did not make the allowances ,' said she , ` which I ought to have done , for his temper and spirits -- his delightful spirits , and that gaiety , that playfulness of disposition , which , under any other circumstances , would , I am sure , have been as constantly bewitching to me , as they were at first .'
" I saw her answer !-- nothing could be clearer ."
" Ah !
Harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since those two decisive dances .-- Emma knew that he had , on that occasion , found her much superior to his expectation .
He called her ` Augusta .'
If _we_ exert ourselves , I think we shall not be long in want of allies .
No ; he was talking to Mrs . Cole -- he was looking on unconcerned ; Jane was asked by somebody else , and he was still talking to Mrs . Cole .
His air and voice recovered their usual briskness : he shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand , and entered on the subject in a manner to prove , that he now only wanted time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing .
Do not mimic her .
It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast .
Harriet bore the intelligence very well -- blaming nobody -- and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion of herself , as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to her friend .
" It would be a crowd -- a sad crowd ; and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in ?"
But I live out of the world , and am often astonished at what I hear .
A sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded by her general state , had carried her off after a short struggle .
Undoubtedly if you wish it , I will endeavour to persuade them both ."
Her face was averted from those who had made the attack , and turned towards her aunt .
" Read it , read it ," said he , " it will give you pleasure ; only a few lines -- will not take you long ; read it to Emma ."
Knightley must not marry !-- You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell ?-- Oh !
Circumstances that might swell to half an hour ' s relation , and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them , had passed undiscerned by her who now heard them ; but the two latest occurrences to be mentioned , the two of strongest promise to Harriet , were not without some degree of witness from Emma herself .-- The first , was his walking with her apart from the others , in the lime - walk at Donwell , where they had been walking some time before Emma came , and he had taken pains ( as she was convinced ) to draw her from the rest to himself -- and at first , he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done before , in a very particular way indeed !--( Harriet could not recall it without a blush .)
Will not it be a good plan ?
Emma did not want to be classed with the Mrs . Eltons , the Mrs . Perrys , and the Mrs . Coles , who would force themselves anywhere ; neither could she feel any right of preference herself -- she submitted , therefore , and only questioned Miss Bates farther as to her niece ' s appetite and diet , which she longed to be able to assist .
Miss Hawkins ,-- I dare say , an excellent young woman .
They sat down to tea -- the same party round the same table -- how often it had been collected !-- and how often had her eyes fallen on the same shrubs in the lawn , and observed the same beautiful effect of the western sun !-- But never in such a state of spirits , never in any thing like it ; and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house , or even the attentive daughter .
The aunt and niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room .
They vindicated him against the base aspersion .
An injunction of secresy had been among Mr . Weston ' s parting words .
Such schemes as these are nothing without numbers .
How is Mr .
" Mrs . Gilbert does not mean to dance , but there is a young lady disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing -- Miss Smith ."
He had expressed himself as to coming , with more than common certainty .
Mr . Weston certainly would never marry again .
She never stopt till she had gone through the whole ; and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong , yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed -- and he had suffered , and was very sorry -- and he was so grateful to Mrs . Weston , and so much in love with Miss Fairfax , and she was so happy herself , that there was no being severe ; and could he have entered the room , she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever .
.
" Ah !-- so you say ; but I cannot believe it ."
My dear Mrs . Weston , do not take to match - making .
Emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly .
Mr . Knightley had spoken prophetically , when he once said , " Emma , you have been no friend to Harriet Smith ."
She could never quit him ."
Ten minutes would have been all that was necessary , perhaps all that was proper ; and I had told my father I should certainly be at home before him -- but there was no getting away , no pause ; and , to my utter astonishment , I found , when he ( finding me nowhere else ) joined me there at last , that I had been actually sitting with them very nearly three - quarters of an hour .
Her next beginning was ,
It was a clear thing he was less in love than he had been .
I do not care for myself .
You got Hannah that good place .
" How often , when you were a girl , have you said to me , with one of your saucy looks --` Mr . Knightley , I am going to do so - and - so ; papa says I may , or I have Miss Taylor ' s leave '-- something which , you knew , I did not approve .
They might chuse to surprize her ."
My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings , Lords of the earth !
By his style , I should imagine it just settled ."
He thought she had undertaken more than she was equal to , and that she felt it so herself , though she would not own it .
But poor Mrs . Bates had a bad cold about a month ago ."
" Oh !
He would be always coming over .
On this article I can fully acquit him .
I have no faith in Mrs . Elton ' s acknowledging herself the inferior in thought , word , or deed ; or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good - breeding .
There was certainly no harm in his travelling sixteen miles twice over on such an errand ; but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve .
It is not Swisserland , but it will be something for a young man so much in want of a change .
" For my companion tells me ," said she , " that I absolutely promised Miss Bates last night , that I would come this morning .
Look at the tree ."
I would have her understand me .
Her feelings altered towards Emma .-- Offended , probably , by the little encouragement which her proposals of intimacy met with , she drew back in her turn and gradually became much more cold and distant ; and though the effect was agreeable , the ill - will which produced it was necessarily increasing Emma ' s dislike .
They are ripening fast ."
or a shark ?
where shall we sit ?
But you know what I am .-- You hear nothing but truth from me .-- I have blamed you , and lectured you , and you have borne it as no other woman in England would have borne it .-- Bear with the truths I would tell you now , dearest Emma , as well as you have borne with them .
He had walked up one day after dinner , as he very often did , to spend his evening at Hartfield .
It is a beautiful moonlight night ; and so mild that I must draw back from your great fire ."
I do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged .
You have every body dearest to you always at hand , I , probably , never shall again ; and therefore till I have outlived all my affections , a post - office , I think , must always have power to draw me out , in worse weather than to - day ."
She asked no more questions therefore , merely employed her own fancy , and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money concern -- something just come to light , of a disagreeable nature in the circumstances of the family ,-- something which the late event at Richmond had brought forward .
Anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could , she soon afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath , a little raised on one side of the lane , leaving them together in the main road .
" I do not offer it for Miss Smith ' s collection ," said he .
" If Mrs . Gilbert wishes to dance ," said he , " I shall have great pleasure , I am sure -- for , though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man , and that my dancing days are over , it would give me very great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs .
" Dear me !
I will answer for it _she_ never betrayed the least thing in the world .
You would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way , if you were married ."
He did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by Mrs . Weston ; but , undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter .
So peculiarly the lady in it .-- Just colour enough for beauty ."
I am sure of having their opinions with me ."
I hope he will be calling soon .
From that evening , or at least from the time of Miss Woodhouse ' s encouraging her to think of him , Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he had been used to do , and of his having indeed quite a different manner towards her ; a manner of kindness and sweetness !-- Latterly she had been more and more aware of it .
Harriet was on the point of leaving the room , and only stopt to say , with a very interesting naivete ,
I found Harriet more conversable than I expected ."
Elton , and Miss Hawkins !-- Good morning to you ."
Granted ;-- for private enjoyment ; and for private enjoyment keep them .
This Emma felt was aimed at her ; and it made her quite angry .
Only three of us .-- besides dear Jane at present -- and she really eats nothing -- makes such a shocking breakfast , you would be quite frightened if you saw it .
" Your feelings are singular .
Mr . Weston was chatty and convivial , and no friend to early separations of any sort ; but at last the drawing - room party did receive an augmentation .
But fetch them both .
I have a right to talk on such subjects , without being suspected of introducing Robert Martin ."
and I can account for it only in one way ; you are not yourself , or you could not speak either to me , or of Harriet , in such a manner .
was Mrs . Weston ' s parting question .
Vanity working on a weak head , produces every sort of mischief .
Observe the turn of her throat .
Mr . Weston , you must really have had Aladdin ' s lamp .
" I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her .
