They ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through the winter .
From Harriet ' s happening not to be at Hartfield , and her father ' s being present to engage Mr . Elton , she had a quarter of an hour of the lady ' s conversation to herself , and could composedly attend to her ; and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that Mrs . Elton was a vain woman , extremely well satisfied with herself , and thinking much of her own importance ; that she meant to shine and be very superior , but with manners which had been formed in a bad school , pert and familiar ; that all her notions were drawn from one set of people , and one style of living ; that if not foolish she was ignorant , and that her society would certainly do Mr . Elton no good .
I promised my wife to leave it all to her .
are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr .
CHAPTER X
If it were to be shared with the woman he loved , he could not think any man to be pitied for having that house .
Emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault .
If I meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore , consider that point as settled ."
had it , by any blessed felicity , occurred to her , to institute the comparison .-- She saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider Mr . Knightley as infinitely the superior , or when his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear .
He went to town on business three days ago , and I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting to send to John .-- He delivered these papers to John , at his chambers , and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley ' s .
The terror which the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet was then their own portion .
You cannot really , seriously , doubt it .
" What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be !
No additional agitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved -- and the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the appointed time .-- A fortnight , at least , of leisure and peace of mind , to crown every warmer , but more agitating , delight , should be hers .
Oh !
The manner , perhaps , may have as little to recommend them .
Emma ' s pensive meditations , as she walked home , were not interrupted ; but on entering the parlour , she found those who must rouse her .
" Certainly ; you must be sensible that the last half - year has made a great difference in your way of life ."
Some are gone to the ponds , and some to the lime walk .
William Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year .
I am very sure you did me good .
It was not with Mrs . Suckling , it was not with Mrs . Bragge , but in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them : it was with a cousin of Mrs . Bragge , an acquaintance of Mrs . Suckling , a lady known at Maple Grove .
Mrs . Weston , capital in her country - dances , was seated , and beginning an irresistible waltz ; and Frank Churchill , coming up with most becoming gallantry to Emma , had secured her hand , and led her up to the top .
" But why should you be sorry , sir ?-- I assure you , it did the children a great deal of good ."
The difficulty was great of driving his strange insensibility towards Harriet , from her mind , while he not only sat at her elbow , but was continually obtruding his happy countenance on her notice , and solicitously addressing her upon every occasion .
" Nay , how could I help saying what I did ?-- Nobody could have helped it .
" You are very right ; it has been thought of .
no , now I recollect , now I have it ; something happened before tea , but not that .
Well , I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland ."
how so ?
I hope they are quite well .
It was folly to be disturbed by it .
" Very likely .-- I think they are , without exception , the most vulgar girls in Highbury ."
Poor Mr . Woodhouse trembled as he sat , and , as Emma had foreseen , would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again .
So very obliging of Mr . Frank Churchill !
A gentleman ' s family is all that I should condition for ."
She was the instigator .
Good Heavens !-- What can be to be _broke_ to me , that does not relate to one of that family ?"
He thought principally of Mrs . Churchill ' s illness , and wanted to know how she was treated ; and as for the ball , it was shocking to have dear Emma disappointed ; but they would all be safer at home .
Considering the very particular friendship between her and Mrs . Dixon , you could hardly have expected her to be excused from accompanying Colonel and Mrs .
Would not Mr . Knightley shew them the gardens -- all the gardens ?-- She wished to see the whole extent ."
He saw his son every year in London , and was proud of him ; and his fond report of him as a very fine young man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too .
" Aye , I see what you are thinking of , the pianoforte .
You must have done well .
It was done however .
You will allow me to bring Jane Fairfax ?"
That ' s a consideration indeed .-- But John , as to what I was telling you of my idea of moving the path to Langham , of turning it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows , I cannot conceive any difficulty .
She had no objection .
" Those who knew any thing about it , must have felt the difference .
I am sure you did not much expect to like us .
Harriet really wished , and had wished some time , to consult a dentist .
Some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings .
` I will not say , that since I entered into the engagement I have not had some happy moments ; but I can say , that I have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour :'-- and the quivering lip , Emma , which uttered it , was an attestation that I felt at my heart ."
Mrs . Weston added , " that he could only allow himself time to hurry to Highbury , after breakfast , and take leave of the few friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him ; and that he might be expected at Hartfield very soon ."
He had , by that time , realised an easy competence -- enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining Highbury , which he had always longed for -- enough to marry a woman as portionless even as Miss Taylor , and to live according to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition .
" I am sorry to hear you say so , sir ; but I assure you , excepting those little nervous head - aches and palpitations which I am never entirely free from anywhere , I am quite well myself ; and if the children were rather pale before they went to bed , it was only because they were a little more tired than usual , from their journey and the happiness of coming .
The listeners were amused ; and Mrs . Weston gave Emma a look of particular meaning .
It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin .
" How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this occasion , Miss Fairfax .
In the present instance , it was sickness and poverty together which she came to visit ; and after remaining there as long as she could give comfort or advice , she quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene as made her say to Harriet , as they walked away ,
yes , quite indispensable ."
The worn - out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming ; and in the rapidity of half a moment ' s thought , she hoped Mr . Elton would now be talked of no more .
Do you think it is a good one ?
there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr . Knightley .
-- Emma had promised ; but still Harriet must be excepted .
We were just in time ; my mother just ready for us .
Little Henry was in her thoughts , and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her irresolute what else to say .
" If not in our dispositions ," she presently added , with a look of true sensibility , " there is a likeness in our destiny ; the destiny which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own ."
it gives one exactly the idea of such a height as Miss Smith ' s .
Mr . Weston was chatty and convivial , and no friend to early separations of any sort ; but at last the drawing - room party did receive an augmentation .
It was a commission to touch every favourite feeling .
She is a woman that one may , that one _must_ laugh at ; but that one would not wish to slight .
Mr . John Knightley must be in town again on the 28th , and we ought to be thankful , papa , that we are to have the whole of the time they can give to the country , that two or three days are not to be taken out for the Abbey .
Knightley !-- Mr .
and it was but yesterday I was telling Mr . Cole , I really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing - room , while I do not know one note from another , and our little girls , who are but just beginning , perhaps may never make any thing of it ; and there is poor Jane Fairfax , who is mistress of music , has not any thing of the nature of an instrument , not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world , to amuse herself with .-- I was saying this to Mr . Cole but yesterday , and he quite agreed with me ; only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase , hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can ; and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought -- or else I am sure we ought to be ashamed of it .-- We are in great hopes that Miss Woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening ."
The woman was better off ; she might have the assistance of fine clothes , and the privilege of bashfulness , but the man had only his own good sense to depend on ; and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor Mr . Elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just married , the woman he had wanted to marry , and the woman whom he had been expected to marry , she must allow him to have the right to look as little wise , and to be as much affectedly , and as little really easy as could be .
We never were so long without seeing her before , and as I was telling Mrs . Cole , we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now ."
Then turning to Mrs . Weston , with a look of gentle reproach --" Ah !
But she was not at all sorry that she had abused the housekeeper the other day .-- Shocking plan , living together .
For a few days , every morning visit in Highbury included some mention of the handsome letter Mrs . Weston had received .
In the course of the spring she must return their civilities by one very superior party -- in which her card - tables should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs in the true style -- and more waiters engaged for the evening than their own establishment could furnish , to carry round the refreshments at exactly the proper hour , and in the proper order .
When Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wandering about the meadows , at some distance from Highbury , on the afternoon of the very day on which she had , under the plea of being unequal to any exercise , so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage , she could have no doubt -- putting every thing together -- that Jane was resolved to receive no kindness from _her_ .
Her father was growing nervous , and could not understand _her_ .
" Why , to own the truth ," cried Miss Bates , who had been trying in vain to be heard the last two minutes , " if I must speak on this subject , there is no denying that Mr . Frank Churchill might have -- I do not mean to say that he did not dream it -- I am sure I have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world -- but if I am questioned about it , I must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring ; for Mrs . Perry herself mentioned it to my mother , and the Coles knew of it as well as ourselves -- but it was quite a secret , known to nobody else , and only thought of about three days .
" You are so noble in your ideas !"
I could have wished , however , as you know , that you had seen Mr . Wingfield before you left home ."
Another accidental meeting with the Martins was possible , and in her present state , would be dangerous .
She met Mr . Weston on his entrance , with a smiling countenance , exclaiming ,
I think Harriet is doing extremely well .
" And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me ," said Emma , " and a very considerable one -- that I made the match myself .
The lane made a slight bend ; and when that bend was passed , Mr . Elton was immediately in sight ; and so near as to give Emma time only to say farther ,
" And make her like myself ."
poor woman , who would have thought it !"
I am quite ready .
This is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating .
" Here is April come !"
" Oh !
Then , if you please , you shall send it all to Mrs . Goddard ' s -- I do not know -- No , I think , Miss Woodhouse , I may just as well have it sent to Hartfield , and take it home with me at night .
But why must she consent to be with the Eltons ?-- Here is quite a separate puzzle ."
Oh !
