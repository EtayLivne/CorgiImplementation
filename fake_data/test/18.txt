What arises from discretion must be honoured ."
This proves that he can leave the Churchills ."
Excellent dancing indeed !-- Yes , my dear , I ran home , as I said I should , to help grandmama to bed , and got back again , and nobody missed me .-- I set off without saying a word , just as I told you .
One says those sort of things , of course , without any idea of a serious meaning .
" No , I have not ; I know nothing ; pray tell me ."
" Oh !
Highbury , the large and populous village , almost amounting to a town , to which Hartfield , in spite of its separate lawn , and shrubberies , and name , did really belong , afforded her no equals .
I certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than I do .
" My dear Jane , say no more about it .
CHAPTER IX
And having gone through what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement , and his persisting to act in direct opposition to Jane Fairfax ' s sense of right , he made a fuller pause to say , " This is very bad .-- He had induced her to place herself , for his sake , in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness , and it should have been his first object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarily .-- She must have had much more to contend with , in carrying on the correspondence , than he could .
_Now_ , he said , he was beginning to have no longer the same wish .
His aunt could not bear to have him leave her .
" You are in luck .-- Your only blunder was confined to my ear , when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady ."
Pray do not let them talk of it .
It must be very clever , or he would not have brought it .
Jane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury , and was restored to the comforts of her beloved home with the Campbells .-- The Mr . Churchills were also in town ; and they were only waiting for November .
" The old lady !
" Oh !
Emma agreed to it , and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet ' s account , which she could not give any sincere explanation of .
I have been walking all this way in complete suspense .
dear , Kingston -- are you ?-- Mrs .
" Me !"
Harriet ' s claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them .
He has no occasion to marry , either to fill up his time or his heart ."
Jane declined it , however , and the husband and wife walked off .
" _My_ report from Mrs . Goddard ' s ," said she presently , " was not so pleasant as I had hoped --` Not better ' was _my_ answer ."
CHAPTER II
" If I had set my heart on Mr . Elton ' s marrying Harriet , it would have been very kind to open my eyes ; but at present I only want to keep Harriet to myself .
An airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack , and arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison .
It was a happy circumstance , and animated Mr . Woodhouse for some time .
He thought she had undertaken more than she was equal to , and that she felt it so herself , though she would not own it .
He was invited to contribute any really good enigmas , charades , or conundrums that he might recollect ; and she had the pleasure of seeing him most intently at work with his recollections ; and at the same time , as she could perceive , most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant , nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass his lips .
Her heart was in a glow , and she feared her face might be as hot .
You really are a very sad girl , and do not know how to take care of yourself .-- To the post - office indeed !
He perfectly agreed with her : and after walking together so long , and thinking so much alike , Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him , that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting .
How inconsiderate , how indelicate , how irrational , how unfeeling had been her conduct !
The ground covered with snow , and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw , which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise , every morning beginning in rain or snow , and every evening setting in to freeze , she was for many days a most honourable prisoner .
Her mind was in a state of flutter and wonder , which made it impossible for her to be collected .
Nothing wanting .
I say , sir ," turning to Mr . Woodhouse , " I think there are few places with such society as Highbury .
" Cannot you , my dear Emma -- cannot you form a guess as to what you are to hear ?"
" Oh !
The child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer than herself ; and Mrs . Weston ' s heart and time would be occupied by it .
It had just occurred to Mrs . Weston that Mrs . Elton must be asked to begin the ball ; that she would expect it ; which interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction .-- Emma heard the sad truth with fortitude .
You pass it over very handsomely -- but you were perfectly right ."
In her letters I shall be at dear Highbury again ."
" Yes ," he replied , " any body may know how highly I think of her ."
" Indeed !"
For my temptation to _think_ it a right , I refer every caviller to a brick house , sashed windows below , and casements above , in Highbury .
Emma was sorry ;-- to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like through three long months !-- to be always doing more than she wished , and less than she ought !
.
" How do you like Mrs .
.
Harriet was standing at one of the windows .
She is not a clever girl , but she has better sense than you are aware of , and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly .
A single woman , with a very narrow income , must be a ridiculous , disagreeable old maid !
It was before tea -- stay -- no , it could not be before tea , because we were just going to cards -- and yet it was before tea , because I remember thinking -- Oh !
You are the worst judge in the world , Mr . Knightley , of the difficulties of dependence .
The most indefatigable , true friend .
She did not always feel so absolutely satisfied with herself , so entirely convinced that her opinions were right and her adversary ' s wrong , as Mr . Knightley .
Nothing wanting .
Let us make the best of it -- and , indeed , almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour .
" I did not mean , I was not thinking of the slave - trade ," replied Jane ; " governess - trade , I assure you , was all that I had in view ; widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on ; but as to the greater misery of the victims , I do not know where it lies .
With this treatment , Mr . Woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking as usual .
Elton , and Miss Hawkins !-- Good morning to you ."
Miss Woodhouse , I am quite concerned , I am sure you hit your foot .
yes , I am quite aware of that .
People of the name of Tupman , very lately settled there , and encumbered with many low connexions , but giving themselves immense airs , and expecting to be on a footing with the old established families .
" You are very kind -- but you are mistaken -- and I must set you right .-- I am not in want of that sort of compassion .
" Yes ," said Jane , " we heard his kind offers , we heard every thing ."
the best nature in the world -- a wedding ."
I have a note of his .-- Do not you remember , Mrs . Weston , employing him to write for you one day ?"
Weather becomes absolutely of no consequence .
" I had only my own family to study from .
It was better to pay my visit , then "--
You would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way , if you were married ."
-- said Emma , still perplexed .
But I am quite in the minority , I believe ; few people seem to value simplicity of dress ,-- show and finery are every thing .
evil to some is always good to others .
So I said I would go down and see , and Jane said , ` Shall I go down instead ?
no , the meeting is certainly to - day ," was the abrupt answer , which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs . Elton ' s side .-- " I do believe ," she continued , " this is the most troublesome parish that ever was .
I wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance , in being able to pay her such attentions , as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father , when her society must be so irksome ."
She continued to look back , but in vain ; and soon , with what appeared unusual speed , they were half way down the hill , and every thing left far behind .
He began -- stopping , however , almost directly to say , " Had I been offered the sight of one of this gentleman ' s letters to his mother - in - law a few months ago , Emma , it would not have been taken with such indifference ."
" You are right .
The couplet does not cease to be , nor does its meaning change .
Then the baked apples came home , Mrs . Wallis sent them by her boy ; they are extremely civil and obliging to us , the Wallises , always -- I have heard some people say that Mrs . Wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer , but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention from them .
See the consequence of keeping you company !-- What do you say to it ?"
" Indeed !"
Let her marry Robert Martin , and she is safe , respectable , and happy for ever ; but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly , and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune , she may be a parlour - boarder at Mrs . Goddard ' s all the rest of her life -- or , at least , ( for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other ,) till she grow desperate , and is glad to catch at the old writing - master ' s son ."
" Mr . Martin , I suppose , is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business ?
Emma then looked up , and immediately saw how it was ; and after a moment ' s debate , as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not , replied ,
I am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you -- and to give you joy in person ."
He was not calm ; his spirits were evidently fluttered ; there was restlessness about him .
_We_ have carriages to fetch and convey her home , and _we_ live in a style which could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax , at any time , the least inconvenient .-- I should be extremely displeased if Wright were to send us up such a dinner , as could make me regret having asked _more_ than Jane Fairfax to partake of it .
Mr . Woodhouse would have been miserable had his daughter attempted it , and she was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas .
I am always well , you know .
He could not say that he was sorry on his own account ; his very cheerful look would have contradicted him if he had ; but he said , and very steadily , that he was sorry for the disappointment of the others , and with considerable kindness added ,
It struck her with dreadful force , and she was ready to give it every bad name in the world .
