The gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice ; they took themselves off in a hurry .
Every thing tender and charming was to mark their parting ; but still they were to part .
He always speaks to the purpose ; open , straightforward , and very well judging .
" That is the case with us all , papa .
" I am quite easy on that head ," replied Mrs . Weston .
" _His_ sufferings ," replied Emma dryly , " do not appear to have done him much harm .
I like old friends ; and Miss Jane Fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady , a very pretty and a very well - behaved young lady indeed .
" But , my dear papa , you are no friend to matrimony ; and therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _bride_ ?
Mr . Perry did say so .
Poor Mr . Woodhouse was silent from consternation ; but every body else had something to say ; every body was either surprized or not surprized , and had some question to ask , or some comfort to offer .
And Jane will have such another .
Mr . Woodhouse very soon followed them into the drawing - room .
The Coles were very respectable in their way , but they ought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit them .
He had hoped she would speak again , but she did not .
You only mean , that he intends it ."
No , he could not believe it a bad house ; not such a house as a man was to be pitied for having .
Understanding and gratification came together .
Short had been the notice -- short their meeting ; he was gone ; and Emma felt so sorry to part , and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from his absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry , and feeling it too much .
Her face was averted from those who had made the attack , and turned towards her aunt .
She was not obliged to hear .
" I never should have presumed to think of it at first ," said she , " but for you .
But Mr . Elton , in person , had driven away all such cares .
Miss Smith , pray take care .
A few awkward moments passed , and he sat down again ; and in a more determined manner said ,
" If we were in the other room ," said Emma , " if I had my writing - desk , I am sure I could produce a specimen .
I am sure she will be an excellent servant ; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see .
yes -- did not you know ?-- Well , well , never mind ."
They might all have hoped to rise by Harriet ' s acquaintance : and besides , what was the value of Harriet ' s description ?-- So easily pleased -- so little discerning ;-- what signified her praise ?
We had great amusement with those letters one morning .
Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young , handsome , rich , nor married .
" I do not know , my dear -- but it is so long since she was here !-- not since last Easter , and then only for a few days .-- Mr .
I felt that , as to fortune , in all probability he might do much better ; and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate , he could not do worse .
The loss of the ball -- the loss of the young man -- and all that the young man might be feeling !-- It was too wretched !-- Such a delightful evening as it would have been !-- Every body so happy !
I should be quite in the way .
Do not you remember what Mr . Perry said , so many years ago , when I had the measles ?
The pain of his continued residence in Highbury , however , must certainly be lessened by his marriage .
I do not pretend to Emma ' s genius for foretelling and guessing .
Late hours do not agree with us .
Considering the very superior claims of the object , it ought ; and judging by its apparently stronger effect on Harriet ' s mind , producing reserve and self - command , it would .-- She must communicate the painful truth , however , and as soon as possible .
" Well ," said Mrs . Weston , smiling , " you give him credit for more simple , disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do ; for while Miss Bates was speaking , a suspicion darted into my head , and I have never been able to get it out again .
How well you put it on !-- so gratified !
You must have done well .
If he were to be very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now , it might augur something .
He was so much displeased , that it was longer than usual before he came to Hartfield again ; and when they did meet , his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven .
a fine complimentary opening : But it is his way .
So I said I would go down and see , and Jane said , ` Shall I go down instead ?
Mr . and Mrs . Elton appeared ; and all the smiles and the proprieties passed .
Fortune I do not want ; employment I do not want ; consequence I do not want : I believe few married women are half as much mistress of their husband ' s house as I am of Hartfield ; and never , never could I expect to be so truly beloved and important ; so always first and always right in any man ' s eyes as I am in my father ' s ."
Mrs . Elton is very good - natured and agreeable , and I dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought to be .
My acquaintance with him has been but trifling .-- And even if I have not underrated him hitherto , he may yet turn out well .-- With such a woman he has a chance .-- I have no motive for wishing him ill -- and for her sake , whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct , I shall certainly wish him well ."
" But really , I am half ashamed , and wish I had never taken up the idea ."
" Dear me !
" You , Emma , who have so few opportunities of dancing , you are really out of luck ; you are very much out of luck !"
I am sure she does .
Emma was gratified , and would soon have shewn no want of words , if the sound of Mrs . Elton ' s voice from the sitting - room had not checked her , and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her congratulatory sensations into a very , very earnest shake of the hand .
-- Yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm , would be so interested about her father , and so delighted with Mrs . Weston ; and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would - be lover , and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners .
Charming people , Mr . and Mrs . Weston ;-- Mrs . Weston indeed is much beyond praise , and he is exactly what one values , so hospitable , and so fond of society ;-- it will be a small party , but where small parties are select , they are perhaps the most agreeable of any .
This was very kind of you to be persuaded to come .
She had a little beauty and a little accomplishment , but so little judgment that she thought herself coming with superior knowledge of the world , to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood ; and conceived Miss Hawkins to have held such a place in society as Mrs . Elton ' s consequence only could surpass .
You cannot really , seriously , doubt it .
So I said , I was very much obliged to him : you know I could not do less ; and then he went back to Elizabeth , and I came round by the stables -- I believe I did -- but I hardly knew where I was , or any thing about it .
It was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject , and he said ,
I thought it must be so .
" No , my dear , I never encouraged any body to marry , but I would always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady -- and a bride , especially , is never to be neglected .
" As you do us such ample justice now ," said Emma , laughing , " I will venture to ask , whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first ?
" Oh !
She questioned him as to the society in Yorkshire -- the extent of the neighbourhood about Enscombe , and the sort ; and could make out from his answers that , as far as Enscombe was concerned , there was very little going on , that their visitings were among a range of great families , none very near ; and that even when days were fixed , and invitations accepted , it was an even chance that Mrs . Churchill were not in health and spirits for going ; that they made a point of visiting no fresh person ; and that , though he had his separate engagements , it was not without difficulty , without considerable address _at_ _times_ , that he could get away , or introduce an acquaintance for a night .
She stopped to breathe .
CHAPTER V
" Indeed , Harriet , it would have been a severe pang to lose you ; but it must have been .
Isabella does not seem more my sister ; has never excited a greater interest ; perhaps hardly so great .
But Mr . Weston is almost an old man .
A variety of evils crossed his mind .
He had long made up his mind to Jane Fairfax ' s going out as governess , and could talk of it cheerfully , but Mr . Knightley ' s going to London had been an unexpected blow .
Now , however , we must wish you and Mrs . Bates good morning ."
" Charming Miss Woodhouse !
Emma , on reaching home , called the housekeeper directly , to an examination of her stores ; and some arrowroot of very superior quality was speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note .
" That will do ," said he , when it was finished , thinking aloud -- " you have sung quite enough for one evening -- now be quiet ."
" Will you be so kind ," said she , " when I am missed , as to say that I am gone home ?-- I am going this moment .-- My aunt is not aware how late it is , nor how long we have been absent -- but I am sure we shall be wanted , and I am determined to go directly .-- I have said nothing about it to any body .
" You should have gone to Cromer , my dear , if you went anywhere .-- Perry was a week at Cromer once , and he holds it to be the best of all the sea - bathing places .
" She would rather not be in his company more than she could help .
He may be sure of every woman ' s approbation while he writes with such gallantry ."
was her immediate exclamation .
This made a difficulty .
She promised , however , to think of it ; and pretty nearly promised , moreover , to think of it , with the intention of finding it a very good scheme .
And not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded .
" What !"
How trifling they make every thing else appear !-- I feel now as if I could think of nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day ; and yet , who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind ?"
It had no advantage of situation ; but had been very much smartened up by the present proprietor ; and , such as it was , there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing eyes .-- Emma ' s remark was --
It was by no means his daughter ' s wish that the intellects of Highbury in general should be put under requisition .
Isabella and Emma , I think , do write very much alike .
Yes , Harriet , just so long have I been wanting the very circumstance to happen what has happened .
She will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience , and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding .
It was being very deficient ."
" I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you , Miss Woodhouse ," she shortly afterwards began , " since the party to Box Hill .
Cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours ."
A piece of paper was found on the table this morning --( dropt , we suppose , by a fairy )-- containing a very pretty charade , and we have just copied it in ."
what do you mean ?-- Mistake you !-- Am I to suppose then ?--"
" Having understood as much , I was rather astonished to find her so very lady - like !
but indeed I would much rather have it only in one .
