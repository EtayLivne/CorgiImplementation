" That is to say , you chose to have your walk , for you were not six yards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you ; and Henry and John had seen more drops than they could count long before .
Mr . Weston must be quiet , and every thing deliberately arranged .
Emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting .
" Nothing can be actually settled yet , perhaps ," replied Emma , smiling --" but , excuse me , it must be thought of ."
I am sure the service Mr . Frank Churchill had rendered you , in protecting you from the gipsies , was spoken of ."
Mrs . Weston laughed , and said he did not know what he was talking about .
One of those points on which his influence failed , he then mentioned .
" I promise you to make none for myself , papa ; but I must , indeed , for other people .
Highbury , that airy , cheerful , happy - looking Highbury , would be his constant attraction ."
Before he could return to his chair , it was taken by Mrs . Weston .
Elton ?-- That will be a favour indeed !
I am not like Jane ; I wish I were .
" Indeed !
and it was but yesterday I was telling Mr . Cole , I really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing - room , while I do not know one note from another , and our little girls , who are but just beginning , perhaps may never make any thing of it ; and there is poor Jane Fairfax , who is mistress of music , has not any thing of the nature of an instrument , not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world , to amuse herself with .-- I was saying this to Mr . Cole but yesterday , and he quite agreed with me ; only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase , hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can ; and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought -- or else I am sure we ought to be ashamed of it .-- We are in great hopes that Miss Woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening ."
We both abhor suspense .
They were a family of the name of Martin , whom Emma well knew by character , as renting a large farm of Mr . Knightley , and residing in the parish of Donwell -- very creditably , she believed -- she knew Mr . Knightley thought highly of them -- but they must be coarse and unpolished , and very unfit to be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect .
She had fallen into good hands , known nothing but kindness from the Campbells , and been given an excellent education .
Miss Woodhouse , how you do forget !"
John Knightley looked at him with amazement , then shrugged his shoulders , and said , " I could not have believed it even of _him_ ."
I have seen a great many lists of her drawing - up at various times of books that she meant to read regularly through -- and very good lists they were -- very well chosen , and very neatly arranged -- sometimes alphabetically , and sometimes by some other rule .
I made her take her shawl -- for the evenings are not warm -- her large new shawl -- Mrs . Dixon ' s wedding - present .-- So kind of her to think of my mother !
I am no dancer ."
" Has he so !-- Then I know nothing of Mr . Elton .
A room at an inn was always damp and dangerous ; never properly aired , or fit to be inhabited .
A young lady who faints , must be recovered ; questions must be answered , and surprizes be explained .
She could not think that Harriet ' s solace or her own sins required more ; and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned ;-- but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded , and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter , and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive -- " Mr . Elton is so good to the poor !"
I was reading it to Mrs . Cole , and since she went away , I was reading it again to my mother , for it is such a pleasure to her -- a letter from Jane -- that she can never hear it often enough ; so I knew it could not be far off , and here it is , only just under my huswife -- and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she says ;-- but , first of all , I really must , in justice to Jane , apologise for her writing so short a letter -- only two pages you see -- hardly two -- and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half .
Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably never fell in Mrs . Elton ' s way before -- and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action , if not in consciousness ."
Is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers ; and has not Mrs . Weston some inimitable figure - pieces in her drawing - room , at Randalls ?"
Exactly so .
she was going to exclaim ; but she presently found that it was a family of old friends , who were coming , like herself , by particular desire , to help Mr . Weston ' s judgment ; and they were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins , who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness , on the same errand , that it seemed as if half the company might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection .
" Miss Woodhouse ," said Frank Churchill , after examining a table behind him , which he could reach as he sat , " have your nephews taken away their alphabets -- their box of letters ?
The anxious cares , the incessant attentions of Mrs . Weston , were not thrown away .
It can be round in five minutes ."
" Mr . Knightley ' s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare Mr . Martin with _him_ .
I dare say Miss Nash would envy you such an opportunity as this of being married .
I have a great regard for Mr . Perry .
Mr . Elton was so hot and tired , that all this wit seemed thrown away .
The more I think of it , the more probable it appears .
asked Mrs .
Of all houses in the kingdom Mrs . Bragge ' s is the one I would most wish to see you in ."
What an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream !
Nothing to signify .
no -- none in the least .
" Take a little time , consider , do not commit yourself ."
" Quite out of the question , quite out of the question ," he replied ;-- " but you must often wish it , I am sure ."
Mrs . Elton turned to Mrs . Weston .
" I have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man .
But this good old Mr . Woodhouse , I wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner .
I condition for nothing else ; but without music , life would be a blank to me .'"
" He ought to come ," said Emma .
She was ready to tell every thing in her power , but on this subject questions were vain .
I am sure I do not know who is not ."
At least , however , I cannot be worse off than I should have been , if the other had been the person ; and now -- it _is_ possible --"
After Emma had talked about it for ten minutes , Mr . Woodhouse felt no unwillingness , and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself , with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him .
So obliged to you for the carriage last night .
He got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor ' s merits , without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse ' s character , than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor ' s .
It has been completely unexpected .
cried he , looking eagerly at her , " are you , indeed ?"
" You mistake me , you quite mistake me ," she replied , exerting herself .
" I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet , to be tempted ; Mr . Elton , you know , ( recollecting herself ,) is out of the question : and I do _not_ wish to see any such person .
My Emma , does not every thing serve to prove more and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other ?"
" I know _that_ is the feeling of you all .
It is such a pretty charade , my dear , that I can easily guess what fairy brought it .-- Nobody could have written so prettily , but you , Emma ."
I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction , comfort , and delight to me , to hear what a musical society I am got into .
I could never hope to equal my own doings at Randalls .
One has not great hopes from Birmingham .
However , _I_ shall always think it a very pleasant party , and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it ."
I beg your pardon , sir .
Emma is spoiled by being the cleverest of her family .
" This is most kind , indeed !-- Miss Woodhouse , it is impossible for me to express -- I hope you will believe -- Excuse me for being so entirely without words ."
Being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling , I have been in no hurry with my congratulations ; but I hope it all went off tolerably well .
" Break it to me ," cried Emma , standing still with terror .-- " Good God !-- Mr .
cried Mr . Elton , " what can be the meaning of this ?-- Miss Smith !-- I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my existence -- never paid her any attentions , but as your friend : never cared whether she were dead or alive , but as your friend .
He had been going to call on them .
The compliment was just returned , coldly and proudly ; and , under indescribable irritation of spirits , she was then conveyed to Hartfield .
" Then it would not be so strong a sense .
We will go to Hartfield afterwards .
The impossibility of her quitting her father , Mr . Knightley felt as strongly as herself ; but the inadmissibility of any other change , he could not agree to .
Emma was delighted , and only wanted him to go on in the same style ; but his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own Jane , and his next words were ,
And as for Harriet , I will venture to say that _she_ cannot gain by the acquaintance .
It is a necessary of life to me ; and having always been used to a very musical society , both at Maple Grove and in Bath , it would have been a most serious sacrifice .
" Well , I am so sorry !-- Oh !
You blush , Harriet .-- Does any body else occur to you at this moment under such a definition ?
Nothing should tempt _her_ to go , if they did ; and she regretted that her father ' s known habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she could wish .
repeated Mrs . Elton .
With all my heart .
She must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing , but if he were criticising her behaviour , she did not feel afraid .
Poor Mr . Woodhouse was silent from consternation ; but every body else had something to say ; every body was either surprized or not surprized , and had some question to ask , or some comfort to offer .
" Difference !
I think he is just the person to do it , even without being in love ."
" Oh !"
" Nothing can be actually settled yet , perhaps ," replied Emma , smiling --" but , excuse me , it must be thought of ."
yes , I always like news .
for the very moment Mr . Cole told Mrs . Cole of it , she sat down and wrote to me .
" I remember once calling you ` George ,' in one of my amiable fits , about ten years ago .
I could not excuse a man ' s having more music than love -- more ear than eye -- a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings .
And ever since she was twelve , Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all .
The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates .
She knows now what gentlemen are ; and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance with Harriet ."
