Where is it ?
The plan was that she should be brought up for educating others ; the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making independence impossible .
Towards the end of Jane ' s second song , her voice grew thick .
I could not think about you so much without doating on you , faults and all ; and by dint of fancying so many errors , have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least ."
And it cannot be for the value of our custom now , for what is our consumption of bread , you know ?
no -- I never conceived you could become indifferent .
Emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment .
It would be a great comfort to Mr . Weston , as he grew older -- and even Mr . Weston might be growing older ten years hence -- to have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense , the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home ; and Mrs . Weston -- no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her ; and it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach , should not have their powers in exercise again .
Witness this very time .
" Has he been here on this occasion -- or has he not ?"
" Very well .
evil to some is always good to others .
The unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by Elizabeth Martin ' s calling at Mrs . Goddard ' s a few days afterwards .
I have often talked to her a good deal .
I only name possibilities .
But I have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she cared for .
He had never heard of such books before I mentioned them , but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he can ."
Papa , do you not think it an excellent improvement ?"
But it should be so no more .
He began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit of Emma .
The Eltons walked together ; Mr . Knightley took charge of Miss Bates and Jane ; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill .
She plays charmingly ."
" Well ," said Emma , " there is no disputing about taste .-- At least you admire her except her complexion ."
It did not accord with the rationality of plan , the moderation in expense , or even the unselfish warmth of heart , which she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday .
" I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her .
" On your side , my love , it was very innocently done .
I can hardly believe it .-- I thought I knew him ."
Emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important service which his better sense would have rendered her , to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly follies -- her wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith ; but it was too tender a subject .-- She could not enter on it .-- Harriet was very seldom mentioned between them .
" But , in spite of all her friends ' urgency , and her own wish of seeing Ireland , Miss Fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and Mrs .
On the contrary , I think a young man might be very safely recommended to take Mr . Elton as a model .
" I have often thought them the worst of the two ," replied he coolly .
yes , and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance .
" Oh !
It seemed as if her eyes were suddenly opened , and she were enabled to see that Mr . Elton was not the superior creature she had believed him .
From Harriet ' s happening not to be at Hartfield , and her father ' s being present to engage Mr . Elton , she had a quarter of an hour of the lady ' s conversation to herself , and could composedly attend to her ; and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her that Mrs . Elton was a vain woman , extremely well satisfied with herself , and thinking much of her own importance ; that she meant to shine and be very superior , but with manners which had been formed in a bad school , pert and familiar ; that all her notions were drawn from one set of people , and one style of living ; that if not foolish she was ignorant , and that her society would certainly do Mr . Elton no good .
I never saw any thing so outree !-- Those curls !-- This must be a fancy of her own .
_Her_ change was equal .-- This one half - hour had given to each the same precious certainty of being beloved , had cleared from each the same degree of ignorance , jealousy , or distrust .-- On his side , there had been a long - standing jealousy , old as the arrival , or even the expectation , of Frank Churchill .-- He had been in love with Emma , and jealous of Frank Churchill , from about the same period , one sentiment having probably enlightened him as to the other .
It would only be giving trouble and distress .
People who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style ."
" I thought he meant to try his skill , by his manner of declining it yesterday ."
Yes .
Emma understood him ; and as soon as she could recover from the flutter of pleasure , excited by such tender consideration , replied ,
The superior degree of confidence towards Harriet , which this one article marked , gave her severe pain .
Were she your equal in situation -- but , Emma , consider how far this is from being the case .
She had no doubt as to his being less in love -- but neither his agitated spirits , nor his hurrying away , seemed like a perfect cure ; and she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her returning power , and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself with her long .
No , she had had enough of interference .
I was ready to have gone with her , but this will do just as well .
Harriet did not consider herself as having any thing to complain of .
Mr . Woodhouse at last was off ; but Mr . Knightley , instead of being immediately off likewise , sat down again , seemingly inclined for more chat .
Mr . Cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago ."
--
And if he were to be lost to them for Harriet ' s sake ; if he were to be thought of hereafter , as finding in Harriet ' s society all that he wanted ; if Harriet were to be the chosen , the first , the dearest , the friend , the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence ; what could be increasing Emma ' s wretchedness but the reflection never far distant from her mind , that it had been all her own work ?
" Thank you , dear Miss Woodhouse , you are all kindness .-- It is impossible to say -- Yes , indeed , I quite understand -- dearest Jane ' s prospects -- that is , I do not mean .-- But she is charmingly recovered .-- How is Mr .
I think it is the state of mind which gives most spirit and delight .
It was hot ; and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered , dispersed way , scarcely any three together , they insensibly followed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of limes , which stretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the river , seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds .-- It led to nothing ; nothing but a view at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars , which seemed intended , in their erection , to give the appearance of an approach to the house , which never had been there .
" He is very young to settle ," was Mr . Woodhouse ' s observation .
With the view of passing off an awkward moment , Emma smilingly said ,
Her father ' s feelings were quite distinct .
If she can hesitate as to ` Yes ,' she ought to say ` No ' directly .
I shall have no fears for you with him .
Former provocations reappeared .
Mrs . Weston was disengaged and Emma began again --" Mr . Frank Churchill writes one of the best gentleman ' s hands I ever saw ."
Emma was pleased with the thought ; and producing the box , the table was quickly scattered over with alphabets , which no one seemed so much disposed to employ as their two selves .
It would be a _secret_ satisfaction ; but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any thing Jane might communicate .
" And who do you think came in while we were there ?"
" We can finish this some other time , you know .
Weston may grow cross from the wantonness of comfort , or his son may plague him ."
" What can it be , Miss Woodhouse ?-- what can it be ?
Emma ' s only surprize was that Jane Fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate Mrs . Elton as she seemed to do .
Miss Fairfax knows it is not from the Campbells , or they would have been guessed at first .
But I am not afraid of your seeing what he writes ."
They had been speaking of it as they walked about Highbury the day before , and Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence .
It was adventuring too far , assuming too much , making light of what ought to be serious , a trick of what ought to be simple .
So mild and ladylike -- and with such talents !-- I assure you I think she has very extraordinary talents .
There was no comfort in having him in London ; he might as well be at Enscombe ; but Richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse .
" Indeed !
` If you must go , my dear ,' said I , ` you must , and I will say you are laid down upon the bed .'"
What arises from discretion must be honoured ."
His information and prospects as to Enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated ; Mrs . Churchill was recovering , and he dared not yet , even in his own imagination , fix a time for coming to Randalls again .
.
An arch look expressed --" I understand you well enough ;" but she said only , " Miss Fairfax is reserved ."
But stranger things have happened ; and when we cease to care for each other as we do now , it will be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested friendship which I can already look forward to with pleasure ."
He looked rather doubtingly -- rather confused ; said something about " honour ,"-- glanced at Emma and at Harriet , and then seeing the book open on the table , took it up , and examined it very attentively .
If it was not for the drawback of her illness -- but I am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin , and looking very poorly .
and his wife ' s persuading him to it , out of care for his health -- just what will happen , I have no doubt , some time or other ; only a little premature .
Jane Fairfax was very elegant , remarkably elegant ; and she had herself the highest value for elegance .
I have another person ' s interest at present so much at heart , that I cannot think any longer about Frank Churchill .
" Very well , I am much obliged to you .
You will hardly believe me -- but twice in one week he and Mr . Bragge went to London and back again with four horses ."
Look at her .
" You mistake me , you quite mistake me ," she replied , exerting herself .
" This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted , and Mr . Weston has done very well for himself ; but he must have knocked up every body else .
And now , poor girl !
yes , my dear , I dare say you might , because you know , the door was open , and the window was open , and Mr . Knightley spoke loud .
" Leave out the two last lines , and there is no reason why you should not write it into your book ."
Fourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six months ago !-- Emma could not but picture it all , and feel how justly they might resent , how naturally Harriet must suffer .
She saw in a moment all the possible good .
" Depend upon me -- but ask no more questions .
There was no immediate appearance .
They have no mercy on her ."
