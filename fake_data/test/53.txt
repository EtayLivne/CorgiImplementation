" How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this occasion , Miss Fairfax .
You must answer it of course -- and speedily ."
Mr . Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt , who have brought him up , and are to provide for him !-- Standing up in the middle of the room , I suppose , and speaking as loud as he could !-- How can you imagine such conduct practicable ?"
" You are in luck .-- Your only blunder was confined to my ear , when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady ."
turning away distressed .
And when he was gone , she almost quarrelled with me -- No , I should not say quarrelled , for we never had a quarrel in our lives ; but she was quite distressed that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone ; she wished I had made him believe we had a great many left .
Emma saw how Mr . Weston understood these joyous prospects .
I have been but half a friend to her ; and if she were _not_ to feel this disappointment so very much , I am sure I have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable for her ;-- William Coxe -- Oh !
" Oh !
It would be a _secret_ satisfaction ; but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any thing Jane might communicate .
Miss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence ; and finding that nothing more was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs . Cole ' s , turned to Frank Churchill .
The affection of the whole family , the warm attachment of Miss Campbell in particular , was the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of Jane ' s decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements .
They were going to remove immediately to Richmond .
" Emma !"
Such might be his constitution ; and as she knew that eating and drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints , she recommended his taking some refreshment ; he would find abundance of every thing in the dining - room -- and she humanely pointed out the door .
Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin ."
I will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs . Elton , by calling you Mr . K .-- But I will promise ," she added presently , laughing and blushing --" I will promise to call you once by your Christian name .
I am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty , and such temper , the highest claims a woman could possess ."
Does Mrs . Churchill do the same ?"
--
Emma , in the meanwhile , could not be satisfied without a dinner at Hartfield for the Eltons .
She had had many a hint from Mr . Knightley and some from her own heart , as to her deficiency -- but none were equal to counteract the persuasion of its being very disagreeable ,-- a waste of time -- tiresome women -- and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second - rate and third - rate of Highbury , who were calling on them for ever , and therefore she seldom went near them .
` If you must go , my dear ,' said I , ` you must , and I will say you are laid down upon the bed .'"
" A bad thing !
I am going to London , to spend a few days with John and Isabella .
-- repeated Frank Churchill , with a look of surprize and displeasure .-- " That is easy -- but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it , I suppose ."
" I shall not scold you .
If it failed to produce equal exertion , it could not be an equal conviction ."
I beg your pardon .
He could sing a little himself .
And she leaned back in the corner , to indulge her murmurs , or to reason them away ; probably a little of both -- such being the commonest process of a not ill - disposed mind .
Robert Martin would never have proceeded so far , if he had not felt persuaded of her not being disinclined to him .
I believe it is the only way that Mr . Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome .
She was feeling too much ; but at last Emma collected from her enough to understand the sort of meeting , and the sort of pain it was creating .
Wingfield thinks the vicinity of Brunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as to air ."
How is Mr .
This moment , if you please .
It is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally beloved -- which gives Isabella all her popularity .-- I have it not -- but I know how to prize and respect it .-- Harriet is my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives .
--
" Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr . Elton ' s marrying , Harriet , is the strongest reproach you can make _me_ .
CHAPTER XII
He was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever ; and , after seeing him , Emma thus moralised to herself :--
" You owe me no apologies ; and every body to whom you might be supposed to owe them , is so perfectly satisfied , so delighted even --"
You quite shock me ; if you mean a fling at the slave - trade , I assure you Mr . Suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition ."
" So very kind !"
What a pity it is that Mr . Weston ever thought of her !"
How Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her thoughts to Mr .
She must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing , but if he were criticising her behaviour , she did not feel afraid .
And he wrote as if he really loved her very much -- but she did not know -- and so , she was come as fast as she could to ask Miss Woodhouse what she should do .--" Emma was half - ashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful .
She is his principal correspondent , I assure you .
.
His letters disgust me ."
But , however , I found afterwards from Patty , that William said it was all the apples of _that_ sort his master had ; he had brought them all -- and now his master had not one left to bake or boil .
Instead of forgetting him , his behaviour was such that she could not avoid the internal suggestion of " Can it really be as my brother imagined ?
" Did she know ?-- had she heard any thing about her , since their being at Randalls ?-- he felt much anxiety -- he must confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably ."
Little Henry was in her thoughts , and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her irresolute what else to say .
" Perhaps she might ; but it is not every man ' s fate to marry the woman who loves him best .
I am much mistaken if Emma ' s doctrines give any strength of mind , or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in life .-- They only give a little polish ."
One perplexity , however , arose , which the gentlemen did not disdain .
Emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour .
A charming place , undoubtedly .
The appearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight ; and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart , and the solicitude of Mrs . Elton to have _her_ carriage first , were gladly endured , in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure .
Indeed , Miss Woodhouse , ( speaking more collectedly ,) with the consciousness which I have of misconduct , very great misconduct , it is particularly consoling to me to know that those of my friends , whose good opinion is most worth preserving , are not disgusted to such a degree as to -- I have not time for half that I could wish to say .
WINDSOR - JULY .
snows a little I see ."
" Oh !
I give you this caution now , because I shall never speak to you again on the subject .
His dancing proved to be just what she had believed it , extremely good ; and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky , if it had not been for the cruel state of things before , and for the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction which her happy features announced .
The bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits ; and her being left in solitary grandeur , even supposing the omission to be intended as a compliment , was but poor comfort .
It is very good advice , and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often found ; for it shall be attended to ."
I do suspect that he is not really necessary to my happiness .
" Happy couple !"
I have done very little ."
To look at her , nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have secured such a situation .
But hush , hush !"
The loss of the ball -- the loss of the young man -- and all that the young man might be feeling !-- It was too wretched !-- Such a delightful evening as it would have been !-- Every body so happy !
Let us make the best of it -- and , indeed , almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour .
CHAPTER IX
And yet it was far , very far , from impossible .-- Was it a new circumstance for a man of first - rate abilities to be captivated by very inferior powers ?
She has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife ."
Bless me !
Can it be woman ?
what a bloom of full health , and such a pretty height and size ; such a firm and upright figure !
and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things ?"
Perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay , and spared her from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished .
" Dirty , sir !
And such a noble fire !-- I am quite roasted .
He rode down for a couple of hours ; he could not yet do more ; but as he came from Randalls immediately to Hartfield , she could then exercise all her quick observation , and speedily determine how he was influenced , and how she must act .
Ladies and gentlemen , I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse ( who , wherever she is , presides ) to say , that she desires to know what you are all thinking of ?"
Fortune I do not want ; employment I do not want ; consequence I do not want : I believe few married women are half as much mistress of their husband ' s house as I am of Hartfield ; and never , never could I expect to be so truly beloved and important ; so always first and always right in any man ' s eyes as I am in my father ' s ."

CHAPTER III
Mr . Elton knows you ."
She had herself been first with him for many years past .
She did not regret it .
Perry says that colds have been very general , but not so heavy as he has very often known them in November .
You do not know how many candidates there always are for the _first_ situations .
" Miss Fairfax ' s compliments and thanks , but is quite unequal to any exercise ."
Mrs . Smallridge is in a great hurry .
He wishes his boys to be active and hardy ; and if they misbehave , can give them a sharp word now and then ; but he is an affectionate father -- certainly Mr . John Knightley is an affectionate father .
