To him who has , it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence , and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought .
I never shall forget his manner .
His good friend Perry , too , whom he had spoken to on the subject , did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind ; but he had desired Perry to be upon the watch , and as he went about so much , something , he thought , might come from that quarter .
I could not bear it for Emma !-- Emma is not strong .
He did , on the condition of some promises on her side : such as that , if she came home cold , she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly ; if hungry , that she would take something to eat ; that her own maid should sit up for her ; and that Serle and the butler should see that every thing were safe in the house , as usual .
You must get his consent before you ask mine ."
Oh !
Early , I know , you had none ."
Her mutterings were chiefly to her husband ; and he murmured , in reply ,
She had often observed the change , to almost the same extent .-- Harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him -- and Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had known of his opinion of Harriet .
" Excuse me ," said Jane earnestly , " I cannot by any means consent to such an arrangement , so needlessly troublesome to your servant .
Mrs . Bates was engaged to spend the evening at Hartfield , James had due notice , and he sanguinely hoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear little John would have any thing the matter with them , while dear Emma were gone .
" What does all that signify ?
She deserves a better fate ."
Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business to be going forward just at this time ?-- Do you imagine it to be the consequence of an immediate commission from him , or that he may have sent only a general direction , an order indefinite as to time , to depend upon contingencies and conveniences ?"
I think they judge wisely .
I remembered what I used to do myself .
She might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments .
" Indeed !-- from Yorkshire , I think .
There are places in town , offices , where inquiry would soon produce something -- Offices for the sale -- not quite of human flesh -- but of human intellect ."
I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I did , but something or other hindered me all the morning ; first one thing , then another , there is no saying what , you know .
She hardly knew yet what Mr . Knightley would ask ; but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution of never quitting her father .-- She even wept over the idea of it , as a sin of thought .
Mr . Knightley had a cheerful manner , which always did him good ; and his many inquiries after " poor Isabella " and her children were answered most satisfactorily .
poor Jane is ill !'
She tried to stop him ; but vainly ; he would go on , and say it all .
I remember it was written from Weymouth , and dated Sept . 28th -- and began , ` My dear Madam ,' but I forget how it went on ; and it was signed ` F . C . Weston Churchill .'
-- She could really say nothing .--" You are silent ," he cried , with great animation ; " absolutely silent !
The joy , the gratitude , the exquisite delight of her sensations may be imagined .
A _Mrs . _ _Elton_ would be an excuse for any change of intercourse ; former intimacy might sink without remark .
" Then it would not be so strong a sense .
He shook his head with a smile , and looked as if he had very little doubt and very little mercy .
Every body is lazy !
Emma made no answer , and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned , but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone .
I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town .
Unwelcome as it was , Mr . Woodhouse could only give a submissive sigh ; and as Emma saw his spirits affected by the idea of his daughter ' s attachment to her husband , she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them .
" Aye , very true .-- I wish I could recollect more of it .
An egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome .
it gives one exactly the idea of such a height as Miss Smith ' s .
Sixty - five miles farther than from Maple Grove to London .
" Dear me !
Do put up your horse at the Crown , and come in ."
May I hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball , to be given , not at Randalls , but at the Crown Inn ?"
" Not Harriet ' s equal !"
He looked as if he fully understood and honoured such a sentiment .
" Here have I ," said she , " actually talked poor Harriet into being very much attached to this man .
" Oh !
In he walked , the first and the handsomest ; and after paying his compliments en passant to Miss Bates and her niece , made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle , where sat Miss Woodhouse ; and till he could find a seat by her , would not sit at all .
I have heard so much in praise of Mr . Frank Churchill .-- At the same time it is fair to observe , that I am one of those who always judge for themselves , and are by no means implicitly guided by others .
Even Emma grew tired at last of flattery and merriment , and wished herself rather walking quietly about with any of the others , or sitting almost alone , and quite unattended to , in tranquil observation of the beautiful views beneath her .
" Service !
yes -- did not you know ?-- Well , well , never mind ."
To guess what all this meant , was impossible even for Emma .
.
Emma remained in a state of vexation too ; but there was more indistinctness in the causes of her ' s , than in his .
It would be the greatest pleasure to them , if you could allow me to attend you there .
That ' s right .
" Has he been here on this occasion -- or has he not ?"
And it is not merely the house -- the grounds , I assure you , as far as I could observe , are strikingly like .
to look on , while repeated attentions were offering to another woman , before her face , and not resent it .-- That is a degree of placidity , which I can neither comprehend nor respect ."
The evening was quiet and conversable , as Mr . Woodhouse declined cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear Isabella , and the little party made two natural divisions ; on one side he and his daughter ; on the other the two Mr . Knightleys ; their subjects totally distinct , or very rarely mixing -- and Emma only occasionally joining in one or the other .
He was always agreeable and obliging , and speaking pleasantly of every body .
Don ' t disturb him .
Emma had hardly expected them : for Mr . Weston , who had called in for half a minute , in order to hear that his son was very handsome , knew nothing of their plans ; and it was an agreeable surprize to her , therefore , to perceive them walking up to the house together , arm in arm .
One could not leave her out ."
With all dear Emma ' s little faults , she is an excellent creature .
I feel it so very due .
Quite a surprize to me !
You persuaded her to refuse him ."
" It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four - and - twenty should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount .
Look at my shoes .
It makes me envious and miserable ;-- I who have never seen it !
Can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations ?
A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked , or because he is attached to her , and can write a tolerable letter ."
" I am afraid Jane is not very well ," said she , " but I do not know ; they _tell_ me she is well .
Mrs . Elton , very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her by such a hope , smiled most graciously .
" He is very obliging ," said Emma ; " but is he sure that Harriet means to marry him ?"
Emma watched them in , and then joined Harriet at the interesting counter ,-- trying , with all the force of her own mind , to convince her that if she wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at figured ; and that a blue ribbon , be it ever so beautiful , would still never match her yellow pattern .
" I think , Harriet , since your acquaintance with us , you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen , that you must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr . Martin .
But what is distance , Mr . Weston , to people of large fortune ?-- You would be amazed to hear how my brother , Mr . Suckling , sometimes flies about .
Has Emma read it all ?
Cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours ."
A fine open sea , he says , and very pure air .
" You may well class the delight , the honour , and the comfort of such a situation together ," said Jane , " they are pretty sure to be equal ; however , I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me .
Were he ever able to get away , the day would be spent in coming and returning .
To her it was real enjoyment to be with the Westons .
Some laughed , and answered good - humouredly .
I am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner , and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to be wholly unmodulated as I stood here ."
But now I seem to feel that I may deserve him ; and that if he does chuse me , it will not be any thing so very wonderful ."
Instances have been known of young people passing many , many months successively , without being at any ball of any description , and no material injury accrue either to body or mind ;-- but when a beginning is made -- when the felicities of rapid motion have once been , though slightly , felt -- it must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more .
Emma could not doubt .
" Mr . Knightley ," said Emma , trying to be lively , but really confused -- " I am in a very extraordinary situation .
She had given them neither men , nor names , nor places , that could raise a blush .
" I doubt its being very clever myself ," said Mr . Weston .
But it is very remarkable that she should always hear Jane better than she does me .
" I am afraid ," returned Emma , sighing , " that I must often have contributed to make her unhappy ."
" You do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as I am ; but still you must , at least I hope you must , think the better of him for it .
" Elegant , agreeable manners , I was prepared for ," said he ; " but I confess that , considering every thing , I had not expected more than a very tolerably well - looking woman of a certain age ; I did not know that I was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs .
I only wanted to prove to you that Mrs . S . admits our apology , and is not offended .
It will be felt so great an attention !
How many a man has committed himself on a short acquaintance , and rued it all the rest of his life !"
