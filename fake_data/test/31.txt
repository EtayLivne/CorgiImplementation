All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject , but I believed none of it .
Proportions , fore - shortening .-- Oh no !
To speak , she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness .
With an alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively , with the real good - will of a mind delighted with its own ideas , did she then do all the honours of the meal , and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters , with an urgency which she knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests .
Poor little creatures , how unhappy she would have made them !"
yes -- Mr . Knightley and I both saying we liked it , and Mr . Elton ' s seeming resolved to learn to like it too .
Would not Mr . Knightley shew them the gardens -- all the gardens ?-- She wished to see the whole extent ."
Her spirits seemed overcome .
" Will he , indeed ?
Mr . Elton was all obligation and cheerfulness ; he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed , that she began to think he must have received a different account of Harriet from what had reached her .
" You like it , my Emma , as little as I feared .-- I wish our opinions were the same .
" But you may come again in the cool of to - morrow morning ."
I shall not be far off , if you want me ."
It was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage .
-- And from her great , her more than commonly thankful delight towards Mrs . Elton for being there , Emma guessed that there had been a little show of resentment towards Jane , from the vicarage quarter , which was now graciously overcome .-- After a few whispers , indeed , which placed it beyond a guess , Mrs . Elton , speaking louder , said ,
Much beyond my hopes .
" How you can bear such recollections , is astonishing to me !-- They _will_ sometimes obtrude -- but how you can court them !"
Mr . Weston was musing .
She would not have been puzzled , had she dared fix on them .
Surry is full of beauties ."
I have a great regard for you and Emma ; but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence !-- At any rate , it must be better to have only one to please than two ."
Her mutterings were chiefly to her husband ; and he murmured , in reply ,
Woodhouse , who had already taken his little round in the highest part of the gardens , where no damps from the river were imagined even by him , stirred no more ; and his daughter resolved to remain with him , that Mrs . Weston might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety which her spirits seemed to need .
Emma could hardly understand him ; he seemed in an odd humour .
But if , which I rather imagine , your making the match , as you call it , means only your planning it , your saying to yourself one idle day , ` I think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr . Weston were to marry her ,' and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards , why do you talk of success ?
In one moment such a change !
But here is my father coming : you will not object to my reading the charade to him .
Her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do ; and at eighteen or nineteen she was , as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children , fully competent to the office of instruction herself ; but she was too much beloved to be parted with .
there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort .
Her silence disturbed him ; and after observing her a little while , he added ,
Her early attachment to herself was very amiable ; and her inclination for good company , and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever , shewed that there was no want of taste , though strength of understanding must not be expected .
The nature and the simplicity of gentlemen and ladies , with their servants and furniture , I think is best observed by meals within doors .
" Very well ; and if he had intended to give her one , he would have told her so ."
Nothing of the sort had ever occurred before to any young ladies in the place , within her memory ; no rencontre , no alarm of the kind ;-- and now it had happened to the very person , and at the very hour , when the other very person was chancing to pass by to rescue her !-- It certainly was very extraordinary !-- And knowing , as she did , the favourable state of mind of each at this period , it struck her the more .
Mr . Frank Churchill still declined it , looking as serious as he could , and his father gave his hearty support by calling out , " My good friend , this is quite unnecessary ; Frank knows a puddle of water when he sees it , and as to Mrs . Bates ' s , he may get there from the Crown in a hop , step , and jump ."
Emma thought at least it would turn out so .
" She must be very lively , and have hazle eyes .
I admire all that quaint , old - fashioned politeness ; it is much more to my taste than modern ease ; modern ease often disgusts me .
You were very bad with the measles ; that is , you would have been very bad , but for Perry ' s great attention .
As Harriet described it , there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour .
Mr . Weston ' s dining - room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably ; and for my part , I would rather , under such circumstances , fall short by two than exceed by two .
The weather added what it could of gloom .
" Oh !
Mr . Churchill has pride ; but his pride is nothing to his wife ' s : his is a quiet , indolent , gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody , and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome ; but her pride is arrogance and insolence !
As the sun is out , I believe I had better take my three turns while I can .
" Me !"
It is a retired place .
I hope you have pleasant accounts from Windsor ?"
Mr . Knightley and Harriet !-- It was an odd tete - a - tete ; but she was glad to see it .-- There had been a time when he would have scorned her as a companion , and turned from her with little ceremony .
She could not endure its noise .
This has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed .
Miss Woodhouse was so great a personage in Highbury , that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure ; but the humble , grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings , delighted with the affability with which Miss Woodhouse had treated her all the evening , and actually shaken hands with her at last !
And here , instead of its being a matter of condolence , it turns out to be one of congratulation .-- I congratulate you , Mr . Weston , with all my heart , on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished young women in England for your daughter ."
" I am afraid we must be running away ," said Emma , glancing at Harriet , and beginning to rise --" My father will be expecting us .
" Break it to me ," cried Emma , standing still with terror .-- " Good God !-- Mr .
Of course I have not transcribed beyond the first eight lines ."
Emma turned round to look at her in consternation , and hastily said ,
" Here is something quite new to me .
united , what reverse we have !
Jane she had a distinct glimpse of , looking extremely ill ; and , before the door had shut them out , she heard Miss Bates saying , " Well , my dear , I shall _say_ you are laid down upon the bed , and I am sure you are ill enough ."
" True , sir ; and Emma , because she had Miss Fairfax ."
Frank turned instantly to Emma , to claim her former promise ; and boasted himself an engaged man , which his father looked his most perfect approbation of -- and it then appeared that Mrs . Weston was wanting _him_ to dance with Mrs . Elton himself , and that their business was to help to persuade him into it , which was done pretty soon .-- Mr . Weston and Mrs . Elton led the way , Mr . Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed .
" Oh !
It was settled so , upon the hill , while we were walking about with Mr . Knightley .
Before this time last year I assure you we had had a delightful exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston ."
You and I must positively exert our authority ."
Ah !
--
She was now met by Mrs .
" I assure you she did .
What is to become of that ?-- Very true .
Who do you think is here ?-- Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith ; so kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte .
" You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before ."
But I was really quite shocked the other day -- for Mr . Knightley called one morning , and Jane was eating these apples , and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them , and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock .
Don ' t scruple .
His tall , firm , upright figure , among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men , was such as Emma felt must draw every body ' s eyes ; and , excepting her own partner , there was not one among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him .-- He moved a few steps nearer , and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner , with what natural grace , he must have danced , would he but take the trouble .-- Whenever she caught his eye , she forced him to smile ; but in general he was looking grave .
No coffee , I thank you , for me -- never take coffee .-- A little tea if you please , sir , by and bye ,-- no hurry -- Oh !
Either because he did not dance himself , or because the plan had been formed without his being consulted , he seemed resolved that it should not interest him , determined against its exciting any present curiosity , or affording him any future amusement .
Most cordially , when Miss Bates arrived , did she agree that it must .
yes , I am quite aware of that .
Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business to be going forward just at this time ?-- Do you imagine it to be the consequence of an immediate commission from him , or that he may have sent only a general direction , an order indefinite as to time , to depend upon contingencies and conveniences ?"
Emma was extremely gratified .-- They were interrupted by the bustle of Mr . Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again .
He is the very best young man -- But , my dear Jane , if you remember , I told you yesterday he was precisely the height of Mr . Perry .
` The consequence ,' said she , ` has been a state of perpetual suffering to me ; and so it ought .
CHAPTER V
It was a done thing ; Mr . Elton was to go , and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment ; never had his smile been stronger , nor his eyes more exulting than when he next looked at her .
I hope time has not made you less willing to pardon .
She merely said , in the course of some trivial chat , " Well , Harriet , whenever you marry I would advise you to do so and so "-- and thought no more of it , till after a minute ' s silence she heard Harriet say in a very serious tone , " I shall never marry ."
The doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other .
What are we to do ?-- The year will wear away at this rate , and nothing done .
He had no idea of me .
" Oh !
I can only say that there was smoothness outwardly .
Plain dealing was always best .
The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove , " My brother Mr . Suckling ' s seat ;"-- a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove .
My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well .
I am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing .
She was obliged to leave the door ajar as she found it ; but she fully intended that Mr . Elton should close it .
They had been meeting almost every day since his arrival .
And in this style he talked on for some time very properly , not much attending to any answer , but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat ; and Emma was quite in charity with him .
