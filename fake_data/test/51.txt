I must love him ; and now that I am satisfied on one point , the one material point , I am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well , and ready to hope that it may .
" We can finish this some other time , you know .
At this moment they were approaching Ford ' s , and he hastily exclaimed , " Ha !
This was all sent with the instrument .
But it is even so .
" As to that -- I do not --"
Have you finished it ?
We must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax ."
had it , by any blessed felicity , occurred to her , to institute the comparison .-- She saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider Mr . Knightley as infinitely the superior , or when his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear .
Emma liked the subject so well , that she began upon it , to Mrs . Weston , very soon after their moving into the drawing - room : wishing her joy -- yet observing , that she knew the first meeting must be rather alarming .-- Mrs . Weston agreed to it ; but added , that she should be very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked of : " for I cannot depend upon his coming .
What a horrible idea !
According to Miss Bates -- it all came from her -- Mrs . Dixon had written most pressingly .
I wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings .
The looking over his letter again , in replying to it , had such a softening tendency , that it was particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions ; and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy , and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say , and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful , that Emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment , he would have been accepted after all .
Respect would be added to affection .
They hardly can satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings : standing in a mother ' s place , but without a mother ' s affection to blind her .
But this does not acquit _him_ , Mrs . Weston ; and I must say , that I think him greatly to blame .
" Poor creatures !
" You would not have encouraged me , then , if you had understood me ?
While he staid , the Martins were forgotten ; and on the very morning of his setting off for Bath again , Emma , to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned , judged it best for her to return Elizabeth Martin ' s visit .
" You are speaking of letters of business ; mine are letters of friendship ."
But consider -- you need not be afraid of delegating power to _me_ .
Whatever money he might come into when his father died , whatever his share of the family property , it is , I dare say , all afloat , all employed in his stock , and so forth ; and though , with diligence and good luck , he may be rich in time , it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet ."
Miss Woodhouse , how you do forget !"
There was a communication before her , one which _she_ only could be competent to make -- the confession of her engagement to her father ; but she would have nothing to do with it at present .-- She had resolved to defer the disclosure till Mrs . Weston were safe and well .
Ford .-- " Yes -- no -- yes , to Mrs . Goddard ' s .
"` Smallridge !'
You pass it over very handsomely -- but you were perfectly right ."
She listened , and found it well worth listening to .
Mr . Perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill .
The style of the visit , and the shortness of it , were then felt to be decisive .
Ambition , as well as love , had probably been mortified .
" I have no hesitation in saying ," replied Mr . Elton , though hesitating a good deal while he spoke ; " I have no hesitation in saying -- at least if my friend feels at all as _I_ do -- I have not the smallest doubt that , could he see his little effusion honoured as _I_ see it , ( looking at the book again , and replacing it on the table ), he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life ."
Mrs . Weston was disengaged and Emma began again --" Mr . Frank Churchill writes one of the best gentleman ' s hands I ever saw ."
Harriet listened , and Emma drew in peace .
She met Mr . Weston on his entrance , with a smiling countenance , exclaiming ,
Trust to me ."
My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings , Lords of the earth !
The yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom I feel I can have nothing to do .
" How I could so long a time be fancying myself !
He was not an ill - tempered man , not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a reproach ; but his temper was not his great perfection ; and , indeed , with such a worshipping wife , it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not be increased .
It is so much beyond any thing I deserve .
The result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words .
One has not great hopes from Birmingham .
" This was really his ," said Harriet .--" Do not you remember one morning ?-- no , I dare say you do not .
But on seeing them together , she became perfectly satisfied .
There were three others , Jane says , which they hesitated about some time .
With insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every body ' s feelings ; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every body ' s destiny .
My dear Harriet , what do you mean ?
" So do I ," said Mrs . Weston gently , " very much ."
Emma returned all her attention to her father , saying in secret --
" I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly ; oftener than I should suppose such a circumstance would , in the common course of things , occur to him ."
A fine place , but very retired ."
said she .-- " The regularity and despatch of it !
Emma could not suppose any such thing , knowing as she did , that both the Mr . Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself ;-- and two basins only were ordered .
" She loves him then excessively , I suppose .
While he lived , it must be only an engagement ; but she flattered herself , that if divested of the danger of drawing her away , it might become an increase of comfort to him .-- How to do her best by Harriet , was of more difficult decision ;-- how to spare her from any unnecessary pain ; how to make her any possible atonement ; how to appear least her enemy ?-- On these subjects , her perplexity and distress were very great -- and her mind had to pass again and again through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it .-- She could only resolve at last , that she would still avoid a meeting with her , and communicate all that need be told by letter ; that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her removed just now for a time from Highbury , and -- indulging in one scheme more -- nearly resolve , that it might be practicable to get an invitation for her to Brunswick Square .-- Isabella had been pleased with Harriet ; and a few weeks spent in London must give her some amusement .-- She did not think it in Harriet ' s nature to escape being benefited by novelty and variety , by the streets , the shops , and the children .-- At any rate , it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself , from whom every thing was due ; a separation for the present ; an averting of the evil day , when they must all be together again .
" Oh !
It ought to be no recommendation to _you_ .
Let my father ' s servant go with you .-- Let me order the carriage .
My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the table spread in the dining - room .
How the delicacy , the discretion of his favourite could have been so lain asleep !
" Dear Miss Woodhouse !"
They should lose her ; and , probably , in great measure , her husband also .-- Frank Churchill would return among them no more ; and Miss Fairfax , it was reasonable to suppose , would soon cease to belong to Highbury .
I have no business to put myself forward ."
" Well done , Mrs .
She played .
With respect to her father , it was a question soon answered .
When they all sat down it was better ; to her taste a great deal better , for Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay , making her his first object .
She knows now what gentlemen are ; and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance with Harriet ."
In half a minute they were in the room .
By your account , he does seem to have had some scruples .
My charge would be much more concise than her ' s , and probably not much in the same spirit ; all that I have to recommend being comprised in , do not spoil them , and do not physic them ."
very unaccountable !
They might all have hoped to rise by Harriet ' s acquaintance : and besides , what was the value of Harriet ' s description ?-- So easily pleased -- so little discerning ;-- what signified her praise ?
" No , certainly not ; I shall go home in the cool of the evening ."
I give you credit for it .
Is not it so ?"
And who but Mr . Knightley could know and bear with Mr . Woodhouse , so as to make such an arrangement desirable !-- The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr . Woodhouse had been always felt in her husband ' s plans and her own , for a marriage between Frank and Emma .
But -- that he should talk of encouragement , should consider her as aware of his views , accepting his attentions , meaning ( in short ), to marry him !-- should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind !-- look down upon her friend , so well understanding the gradations of rank below him , and be so blind to what rose above , as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her !-- It was most provoking .
Very happy to hear it .
" Oh !
" Me !"
" Oh !
After the first chat of pleasure he was silent ; and then , in a graver tone , began with ,
" No , not at Randalls ; I have not been near Randalls ," when the door was thrown open , and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room .
They seemed more like cheerful , easy friends , than lovers .
But I thought he would have staid now , and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned .
said she ; " that is the only security for its freshness ; and nothing could be easier to you ."
She could not think that Harriet ' s solace or her own sins required more ; and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned ;-- but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded , and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter , and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive -- " Mr . Elton is so good to the poor !"
Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home , and thought this the best offer she was likely to have ."
I may not have convinced you perhaps , but I am perfectly convinced myself that Mr . Dixon is a principal in the business ."
Selina is no fine lady , I assure you .
Mr . Knightley , however , shewed no triumphant happiness .
Only give me a carte - blanche .-- I am Lady Patroness , you know .
I am very sure you did me good .
Fairfax of the _______ regiment of infantry , and Miss Jane Bates , had had its day of fame and pleasure , hope and interest ; but nothing now remained of it , save the melancholy remembrance of him dying in action abroad -- of his widow sinking under consumption and grief soon afterwards -- and this girl .
He had met her before breakfast as he was returning from a walk with his little boys , when it had been just beginning to rain .
It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball , which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy .-- She was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the Eltons , and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike ; and his praise of Harriet , his concession in her favour , was peculiarly gratifying .
said he , offering his hand .
