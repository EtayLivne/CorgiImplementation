Her tears fell abundantly -- but her grief was so truly artless , that no dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma ' s eyes -- and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and understanding -- really for the time convinced that Harriet was the superior creature of the two -- and that to resemble her would be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could do .
" I mentioned no _names_ , you will observe .-- Oh !
Now , an attachment to Harriet Smith would have nothing to encounter .
She wished she might be able to keep him from an absolute declaration .
He sat really lost in thought for the first few minutes ; and when rousing himself , it was only to say ,
They had been meeting almost every day since his arrival .
" Oh !
" Yes ; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move , and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure , and fancying himself extremely expert in finding excuses for it .
On the subject of the first of the two circumstances , she did , after a little reflection , venture the following question .
" You are going in , I suppose ?"
That was what happened before tea .
she is a sweet creature !
You , who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on these subjects , who must have been so deep in the business on Miss Campbell ' s account -- we shall not excuse your being indifferent about Mr . Elton and Miss Hawkins ."
Both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again ; and after a few minutes silence , he said ,
She might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison , while a sharer of his conversation with her friend ; and from the best , the purest of motives , might now be denying herself this visit to Ireland , and resolving to divide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty .
cried Harriet .
continued Harriet --" these two last !-- But how shall I ever be able to return the paper , or say I have found it out ?-- Oh !
" I should not have thought it possible ," she began , " that you could have misunderstood me !
no ; there would be a Mrs . Knightley to throw cold water on every thing .-- Extremely disagreeable !
Mrs . Weston , did you ever hear the like ?
You know I candidly told you I should form my own opinion ; and I am happy to say that I am extremely pleased with him .-- You may believe me .
Emma smiled , and felt that Mr . Weston had very good reason for saying so .
I am amused by one part of John ' s letter -- did you notice it ?-- where he says , that my information did not take him wholly by surprize , that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the kind ."
" My dear papa , he is three - and - twenty .
His company so sought after , that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it ; that he has more invitations than there are days in the week .
You like Mr . Elton , papa ,-- I must look about for a wife for him .
One is sick of the very name of Jane Fairfax .
Jane speaks so distinct !
I wish you may not catch cold ."
She was not so materially cast down , however , but that a little time and the return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives .
" It must be a severe trial to them all .
To speak , she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness .
He could say no more ; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him , returned with Mrs . Weston to Mrs . Bates ' s door .
" Such a home , indeed !
" You are very kind -- but you are mistaken -- and I must set you right .-- I am not in want of that sort of compassion .
She hardly knew yet what Mr . Knightley would ask ; but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution of never quitting her father .-- She even wept over the idea of it , as a sin of thought .
Let me recommend Bath to you .
I like her the better for it .
The loss of the ball -- the loss of the young man -- and all that the young man might be feeling !-- It was too wretched !-- Such a delightful evening as it would have been !-- Every body so happy !
How it might be considered by the rest of the party , she could not tell .
We never heard of such things at Maple Grove ."
He had never been in the room at the Crown in his life -- did not know the people who kept it by sight .-- Oh !
" If I know myself , Harriet , mine is an active , busy mind , with a great many independent resources ; and I do not perceive why I should be more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one - and - twenty .
There was instant pleasure in the sight of them , and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound -- for Mr . Weston immediately accosted her with ,
That was what happened before tea .
In half a minute they were together .
" Oh !
Some laughed , and answered good - humouredly .
" Were you really ?-- Well !-- But you observed nothing of course , for it seems to be a new idea to you .-- If I had been there , I think I should have made some discoveries ."
This little explanation with Mr . Knightley gave Emma considerable pleasure .
He did really look and speak as if in a state of no common enjoyment .
" Do not you think , Miss Woodhouse , our saucy little friend here is charmingly recovered ?-- Do not you think her cure does Perry the highest credit ?--( here was a side - glance of great meaning at Jane .)
I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards myself ; but , otherwise , I should loudly protest against the share of it which that woman has known .-- ` Jane ,' indeed !-- You will observe that I have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name , even to you .
She brought no name , no blood , no alliance .
Emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary , indeed , and that she had not a syllable to say for him .
poor Miss Taylor !
If he were , every thing else must give way ; but otherwise his friend Cole had been saying so much about his dining with him -- had made such a point of it , that he had promised him conditionally to come .
There could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs . John Knightley , in this short visit to Hartfield , going about every morning among her old acquaintance with her five children , and talking over what she had done every evening with her father and sister .
Emma listened , and then coolly said , " I shall not be satisfied , unless he comes ."
Had it been allowable entertainment , had there been no pain to her friend , or reproach to herself , in the waverings of Harriet ' s mind , Emma would have been amused by its variations .
How will a conundrum reckon ?"
She was to convey Harriet , and they drove to the Crown in good time , the Randalls party just sufficiently before them .
Highbury , the large and populous village , almost amounting to a town , to which Hartfield , in spite of its separate lawn , and shrubberies , and name , did really belong , afforded her no equals .
What totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house from what she had brought out !-- she had then been only daring to hope for a little respite of suffering ;-- she was now in an exquisite flutter of happiness , and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away .
The idea of her being indebted to Mrs . Elton for what was called an _introduction_ -- of her going into public under the auspices of a friend of Mrs . Elton ' s -- probably some vulgar , dashing widow , who , with the help of a boarder , just made a shift to live !-- The dignity of Miss Woodhouse , of Hartfield , was sunk indeed !
The event , however , was most joyful ; and every day was giving her fresh reason for thinking so .-- Harriet ' s parentage became known .
Oh !
The rest of the gentlemen being now in the room , Emma found herself obliged to turn from him for a few minutes , and listen to Mr . Cole .
They might chuse to surprize her ."
" Upon my word , Emma ."
Three months , she says so , positively , as I am going to have the pleasure of reading to you .
yes -- but how they were conveyed hither ?-- the manner of their coming ?"
Oh !
Let us be discreet -- quite on our good behaviour .-- Hush !-- You remember those lines -- I forget the poem at this moment :
I think you will agree with me , ( turning with a soft air to Emma ,) I think I shall certainly have your approbation , though Mr . Knightley perhaps , from being used to the large parties of London , may not quite enter into our feelings ."
I met the letters in my way this morning , and seeing my son ' s hand , presumed to open it -- though it was not directed to me -- it was to Mrs . Weston .
One perplexity , however , arose , which the gentlemen did not disdain .
The greatest kindness you can shew me , will be to let me have my own way , and only say that I am gone when it is necessary ."
I will do my best .
the amiable , obliging , gentle Mr .
They remained but a few minutes together , as Miss Woodhouse must not be kept waiting ; and Harriet then came running to her with a smiling face , and in a flutter of spirits , which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon to compose .
The backgammon - table was placed ; but a visitor immediately afterwards walked in and made it unnecessary .
" Very bad -- though it might have been worse .-- Playing a most dangerous game .
" Depend upon it , Elton will not do .
Your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave England ."
The rest of the gentlemen being now in the room , Emma found herself obliged to turn from him for a few minutes , and listen to Mr . Cole .
The visit was of course short ; and there was so much embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it , that Emma would not allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady , and on no account to give one , beyond the nothing - meaning terms of being " elegantly dressed , and very pleasing ."
A note was written to urge it .
the letter had much better be all your own .
" Oh !"
" I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her .
She has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife ."
He promised to join me here , and pay his respects to you ."
My mother is so delighted !-- for she is to be three months with us at least .
If it can be contrived to be at the Crown , papa , it will be very convenient for the horses .
_There_ , indeed , lay real pleasure , for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty - four to his comfort ; and feeling that , unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and confiding esteem , she could not , in her general conduct , be open to any severe reproach .
But his spirits were soon rising again , and with laughing eyes , after mentioning the expected return of the Campbells , he named the name of Dixon .-- Emma blushed , and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing .
" Charming Miss Woodhouse !
Emma only nodded , and smiled .-- After a little thinking , and a very tender sigh , he added ,
my sins , my sins !-- And I had plenty all the while in my pocket !-- One of my senseless tricks !-- I deserve to be under a continual blush all the rest of my life .-- Well --( sitting down again )-- go on -- what else ?"
