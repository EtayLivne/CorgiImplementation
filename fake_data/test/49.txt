A man who had been in motion since eight o ' clock in the morning , and might now have been still , who had been long talking , and might have been silent , who had been in more than one crowd , and might have been alone !-- Such a man , to quit the tranquillity and independence of his own fireside , and on the evening of a cold sleety April day rush out again into the world !-- Could he by a touch of his finger have instantly taken back his wife , there would have been a motive ; but his coming would probably prolong rather than break up the party .
" So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax ?"
Many circumstances assisted the temptation .
But what is the meaning of this ?
I had no hesitation in advising him to marry .
Elton ?-- That will be a favour indeed !
She could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his attachment to _her_ .
On another ,
The Randalls party agreed to it immediately ; and after a pretty long speech from Miss Bates , which few persons listened to , she also found it possible to accept dear Miss Woodhouse ' s most obliging invitation .
And how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again ?'
Mr . Weston is such a good - humoured , pleasant , excellent man , that he thoroughly deserves a good wife ;-- and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for ever , and bear all my odd humours , when she might have a house of her own ?"
" It would be very hard , indeed , my dear , if poor Isabella were to be anywhere but at Hartfield ."
I think , Miss Woodhouse , you and I must establish a musical club , and have regular weekly meetings at your house , or ours .
Mr . Weston , who had been a widower so long , and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife , so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his friends here , always acceptable wherever he went , always cheerful -- Mr . Weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it .
" When Frank left us ," continued he , " it was quite uncertain when we might see him again , which makes this day ' s news doubly welcome .
Ford ."
" I have heard her speak of the acquaintance ," said Emma ; " she is a very elegant young woman ."
The disguise , equivocation , mystery , so hateful to her to practise , might soon be over .
I should have expected better judgment in Colonel Campbell ."
" Oh !
" I wish ," said Mrs . Weston , " one could know which arrangement our guests in general would like best .
Kitty , a fair but frozen maid , Kindled a flame I yet deplore , The hood - wink ' d boy I called to aid , Though of his near approach afraid , So fatal to my suit before .
" No , not true on your side .
Emma called on her the next day , and found her doom already signed with regard to Randalls .
Mr . Woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the utmost that his nerves could bear -- and here would be a ninth -- and Emma apprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even to Hartfield for forty - eight hours without falling in with a dinner - party .
My dear , did you change your stockings ?"
" They talked a great deal about him , especially Anne Cox .
My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings , Lords of the earth !
She meant to be very happy , in spite of the scene being laid at Mr . Cole ' s ; and without being able to forget that among the failings of Mr . Elton , even in the days of his favour , none had disturbed her more than his propensity to dine with Mr . Cole .
It will be the only difference ."
William did not seem to mind it himself , he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many ; for William , you know , thinks more of his master ' s profit than any thing ; but Mrs . Hodges , he said , was quite displeased at their being all sent away .
I want you to save yourself from greater pain .
Their propriety , simplicity , and elegance , would make them the safest model for any young woman ."
He was a nervous man , easily depressed ; fond of every body that he was used to , and hating to part with them ; hating change of every kind .
She then began to speak of you , and of the great kindness you had shewn her during her illness ; and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected , desired me , whenever I had an opportunity , to thank you -- I could not thank you too much -- for every wish and every endeavour to do her good .
It would be a disappointment to my father -- and altogether -- I do not know that -- I am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well ."
Poor little dears , how glad they will be to come .
You had it from himself , had you ?"
Frank Churchill , of whom , in the eagerness of her conversation with Mrs . Weston , she had been seeing nothing , except that he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax , followed Mr . Cole , to add his very pressing entreaties ; and as , in every respect , it suited Emma best to lead , she gave a very proper compliance .
No -- till Cole alluded to my supposed attachment , it had never entered my head .
After a little more discourse in praise of gruel , with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every body , he proceeded to say , with an air of grave reflection ,
You know I candidly told you I should form my own opinion ; and I am happy to say that I am extremely pleased with him .-- You may believe me .
.
" How often , when you were a girl , have you said to me , with one of your saucy looks --` Mr . Knightley , I am going to do so - and - so ; papa says I may , or I have Miss Taylor ' s leave '-- something which , you knew , I did not approve .
I thought I had seen you first in February ."
" Oh !
Emma was most agreeably surprized .-- Mr .
" Oh , dear ," cried Harriet , " now I recollect what you mean ; but I was thinking of something very different at the time .
And then , her reserve -- I never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved ."
She remembered what Mr . Knightley had once said to her about Mr . Elton , the caution he had given , the conviction he had professed that Mr . Elton would never marry indiscreetly ; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself .
My dear sir , you really are too bountiful .
no , the meeting is certainly to - day ," was the abrupt answer , which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs . Elton ' s side .-- " I do believe ," she continued , " this is the most troublesome parish that ever was .
Emma returned her friend ' s pressure with interest ; and was pleased enough to exclaim ,
What do you advise ?"
for myself , I protest I must be excused ," said Mrs . Elton ; " _I_ really cannot attempt -- I am not at all fond of the sort of thing .
Such as Mrs . Elton appeared to her on this second interview , such she appeared whenever they met again ,-- self - important , presuming , familiar , ignorant , and ill - bred .
" A very fine young man indeed , Mr . Weston .
The compliment was just returned , coldly and proudly ; and , under indescribable irritation of spirits , she was then conveyed to Hartfield .
yes , and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance .
This appeal to her affections did more than all the rest .
" And the next news , I suppose , will be , that we are to lose you -- just as I begin to know you ."
Her good - nature , too , is not so very slight a claim , comprehending , as it does , real , thorough sweetness of temper and manner , a very humble opinion of herself , and a great readiness to be pleased with other people .
He could not say that he was sorry on his own account ; his very cheerful look would have contradicted him if he had ; but he said , and very steadily , that he was sorry for the disappointment of the others , and with considerable kindness added ,
She had seen only Mrs . Martin and the two girls .
" Oh !
I have often known it done myself ."
" No , no ," said Emma , " it will not reckon low .
.
We must remember to let James know that the carriage will be wanted on Tuesday .
Apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception , and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and Mr . Weston , must necessarily open the cause ; but when these effusions were put by , they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state of the engagement .
It soon flies over the present failure , and begins to hope again .
I am a great dreamer .
There had been no real affection either in his language or manners .
" It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to , if Mr . and Mrs . Weston do not .
It was her own choice to give the time of their absence to Highbury ; to spend , perhaps , her last months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom she was so very dear : and the Campbells , whatever might be their motive or motives , whether single , or double , or treble , gave the arrangement their ready sanction , and said , that they depended more on a few months spent in her native air , for the recovery of her health , than on any thing else .
Every body had a degree of gravity and sorrow ; tenderness towards the departed , solicitude for the surviving friends ; and , in a reasonable time , curiosity to know where she would be buried .
But Jane , it seems , had a letter from them very lately , and not a word was said about it .
A better written letter , Harriet ( returning it ,) than I had expected ."
It has hurt his father equally .
and I always thought you meant it ."
Depend upon it he had encouragement ."
But now she made the sudden resolution of not passing their door without going in -- observing , as she proposed it to Harriet , that , as well as she could calculate , they were just now quite safe from any letter from Jane Fairfax .
He was very much pleased with Randalls , thought it a most admirably arranged house , would hardly allow it even to be very small , admired the situation , the walk to Highbury , Highbury itself , Hartfield still more , and professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but one ' s _own_ country gives , and the greatest curiosity to visit it .
" Excuse me ," said Jane earnestly , " I cannot by any means consent to such an arrangement , so needlessly troublesome to your servant .
Her father -- and Harriet .
Somebody had placed her , several years back , at Mrs . Goddard ' s school , and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlour - boarder .
" Here comes this dear old beau of mine , I protest !-- Only think of his gallantry in coming away before the other men !-- what a dear creature he is ;-- I assure you I like him excessively .
She was not obliged to hear .
said Mrs . Weston in a trembling voice .
This is the simple truth ."
Would Jane but go , means were to be found , servants sent , friends contrived -- no travelling difficulty allowed to exist ; but still she had declined it !
` Oh !'
" Not for the world ," said Emma , smiling graciously , " would I advise you either way .
Knightley .'
" Who shall answer that question ?"
" I can never think of it without laughing .-- She hears us , she hears us , Miss Woodhouse .
I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I did , but something or other hindered me all the morning ; first one thing , then another , there is no saying what , you know .
He was very much pleased with Randalls , thought it a most admirably arranged house , would hardly allow it even to be very small , admired the situation , the walk to Highbury , Highbury itself , Hartfield still more , and professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but one ' s _own_ country gives , and the greatest curiosity to visit it .
Mr . Knightley , who , for some reason best known to himself , had certainly taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill , was only growing to dislike him more .
The pain of being obliged to practise concealment towards him , was very little inferior to the pain of having made Harriet unhappy .
