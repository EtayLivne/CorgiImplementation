She was told that now he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them , almost as often as he could even wish .
Now , however , we must wish you and Mrs . Bates good morning ."
They must keep as much together as they could ;" and James was talked to , and given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage .
" I am glad you think I have been useful to her ; but Harriet only wanted drawing out , and receiving a few , very few hints .
Were she a woman of fortune , I would leave every harmless absurdity to take its chance , I would not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner .
" Oh !
" Mermaids and sharks !
He was wishing to confide in her -- perhaps to consult her ;-- cost her what it would , she would listen .
The varieties of handwriting were farther talked of , and the usual observations made .
Colonel Campbell is a very agreeable man , and Mrs . Campbell a friendly , warm - hearted woman .
But the sight of Mr . Knightley among the most attentive , soon drew away half Emma ' s mind ; and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of Mrs . Weston ' s suspicions , to which the sweet sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions .
It will be felt so great an attention !
Here is the rivet of your mistress ' s spectacles out .
But we never did .
She should then have heard more : Mrs . Weston would speak to her , with a degree of unreserve which she would not hazard with Isabella ; and , she really believed , would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills from her , excepting those views on the young man , of which her own imagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge .
No doubt he is a sensible man , and I suppose may have a natural talent for -- thinks strongly and clearly -- and when he takes a pen in hand , his thoughts naturally find proper words .
I answered it within an hour ; but from the confusion of my mind , and the multiplicity of business falling on me at once , my answer , instead of being sent with all the many other letters of that day , was locked up in my writing - desk ; and I , trusting that I had written enough , though but a few lines , to satisfy her , remained without any uneasiness .-- I was rather disappointed that I did not hear from her again speedily ; but I made excuses for her , and was too busy , and -- may I add ?-- too cheerful in my views to be captious .-- We removed to Windsor ; and two days afterwards I received a parcel from her , my own letters all returned !-- and a few lines at the same time by the post , stating her extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her last ; and adding , that as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued , and as it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible , she now sent me , by a safe conveyance , all my letters , and requested , that if I could not directly command hers , so as to send them to Highbury within a week , I would forward them after that period to her at --: in short , the full direction to Mr . Smallridge ' s , near Bristol , stared me in the face .
They will be extremely glad to see you , I am sure ; and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way ."
" She will be all delight and gratitude , but she will tell you nothing .
` Oh !'
" Yes ," said Mr . John Knightley presently , with some slyness , " he seems to have a great deal of good - will towards you ."
She would not marry , even if she were asked by Mr . Knightley .
" You talk a great deal of the length of this passage , my dear .
She had brought evil on Harriet , on herself , and she too much feared , on Mr .
Mr . Knightley , I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case .
He was warm in his reprobation of Mr . Elton ' s conduct ; it had been unpardonable rudeness ; and Mrs . Elton ' s looks also received the due share of censure .
If she can hesitate as to ` Yes ,' she ought to say ` No ' directly .
I cannot keep my eyes from it .
Something occurred while they were at Hartfield , to make Emma want their advice ; and , which was still more lucky , she wanted exactly the advice they gave .
" As a friend !"
He was thinking .
The information was , as you state , that he was going to be married to a Miss Hawkins .
" He has not been here yet ," replied Emma .
They were interrupted .
It was all right , all open , all equal .
Mr . Woodhouse would have been miserable had his daughter attempted it , and she was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas .
" Mr . Elton going to be married !"
He heard Frank Churchill next say , with a glance towards Jane , " I will give it to her -- shall I ?"
here it is .
Who cried most ?"
With insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every body ' s feelings ; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every body ' s destiny .
Mrs . Goddard , what say you to _half_ a glass of wine ?
He looked around , as if to see that no one were near , and then said ,
She hoped it was not so .
I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly what every man delights in -- what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment .
She ran away to indulge the inclination , leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to Harriet ' s share .
Mr . Knightley loves to find fault with me , you know -- in a joke -- it is all a joke .
I do not believe I did you any good .
The party did not break up without Emma ' s being positively secured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening , nor without her overhearing Mr . Weston whisper to his wife , " He has asked her , my dear .
" My father and Mrs . Weston are at the Crown at this moment ," said Frank Churchill , " examining the capabilities of the house .
Seats tolerably in the shade were found ; and now Emma was obliged to overhear what Mrs . Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of .-- A situation , a most desirable situation , was in question .
Knightley was at Hartfield yesterday , and spoke of it as for Saturday ."
No invitation came amiss to her .
CHAPTER IV
" My dear , dear anxious friend ,"-- said she , in mental soliloquy , while walking downstairs from her own room , " always overcareful for every body ' s comfort but your own ; I see you now in all your little fidgets , going again and again into his room , to be sure that all is right ."
" I am perfectly satisfied ," replied Emma , with the brightest smiles , " and most sincerely wish them happy ."
I am not prejudiced ."
The evil day was put off .
_She_ was a little occupied in weighing her own feelings , and trying to understand the degree of her agitation , which she rather thought was considerable .
A real injury to the children -- a most mortifying change , and material loss to them all ;-- a very great deduction from her father ' s daily comfort -- and , as to herself , she could not at all endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey .
Every body was punctual , every body in their best looks : not a tear , and hardly a long face to be seen .
Her regard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him , and her regrets kept alive , and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss Hawkins ' s happiness , and continual observation of , how much he seemed attached !-- his air as he walked by the house -- the very sitting of his hat , being all in proof of how much he was in love !
Our part of London is very superior to most others !-- You must not confound us with London in general , my dear sir .
But the sight of Mr . Knightley among the most attentive , soon drew away half Emma ' s mind ; and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of Mrs . Weston ' s suspicions , to which the sweet sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions .
_She_ certainly had not been in the wrong , and _he_ would never own that he had .
poor Jane is ill !'
He agreed to it , but with so quiet a " Yes ," as inclined her almost to doubt his real concurrence ; and yet there must be a very distinct sort of elegance for the fashionable world , if Jane Fairfax could be thought only ordinarily gifted with it .
It was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage .
Have you any thing to send or say , besides the ` love ,' which nobody carries ?"
Is it necessary for me to use any roundabout phrase ?-- Your Yorkshire friend -- your correspondent in Yorkshire ;-- that would be the way , I suppose , if I were very bad .-- No , I can pronounce his name without the smallest distress .
very well ," exclaimed Miss Bates , " then I need not be uneasy .
Or Miss Bates ?
She thinks nobody equal to him ."
But she probably had something of that in her thoughts , when alluding to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before .
She was obliged to repeat and explain it , before it was fully comprehended ; and then , being quite new , farther representations were necessary to make it acceptable .
" You know Miss Fairfax ' s situation in life , I conclude ; what she is destined to be ?"
The post - office has a great charm at one period of our lives .
" That is a grand pianoforte , and he might think it too large for Mrs . Bates ' s house ."
Miss Smith , the step at the turning ."
He had his shepherd ' s son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her .
Emma ' s only surprize was that Jane Fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate Mrs . Elton as she seemed to do .
cried Emma , collecting herself resolutely --" Let us understand each other now , without the possibility of farther mistake .
Every body who saw it was pleased , but Mr . Elton was in continual raptures , and defended it through every criticism .
there I am -- thinking of him directly .
They were sneering and negligent .
She had no sense of superiority then .
It can be round in five minutes ."
He reads the Agricultural Reports , and some other books that lay in one of the window seats -- but he reads all _them_ to himself .
" No , not now , I thank you .
It was very wrong of me , you know , to keep any remembrances , after he was married .
" I do not know what I could imagine , but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers .
" I met William Larkins ," continued Mr . Elton , " as I got near the house , and he told me I should not find his master at home , but I did not believe him .-- William seemed rather out of humour .
What right had he to endeavour to please , as he certainly did -- to distinguish any one young woman with persevering attention , as he certainly did -- while he really belonged to another ?-- How could he tell what mischief he might be doing ?-- How could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him ?-- very wrong , very wrong indeed ."
Mrs . John Knightley was delighted to be of use ; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to her -- and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr . Wingfield , she was quite eager to have Harriet under her care .-- When it was thus settled on her sister ' s side , Emma proposed it to her friend , and found her very persuadable .-- Harriet was to go ; she was invited for at least a fortnight ; she was to be conveyed in Mr . Woodhouse ' s carriage .-- It was all arranged , it was all completed , and Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square .
Oh !
It was settled that they should go to Box Hill .
" No -- Mrs . Knightley ;-- and till she is in being , I will manage such matters myself ."
Her heart had been long growing kinder towards Jane ; and this picture of her present sufferings acted as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion , and left her nothing but pity ; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of the past , obliged her to admit that Jane might very naturally resolve on seeing Mrs . Cole or any other steady friend , when she might not bear to see herself .
The man must be a blockhead who wanted more .
Miss Fairfax , I dare say , would not have me if I were to ask her -- and I am very sure I shall never ask her ."
