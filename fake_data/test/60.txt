But we never did .
It is a very cold afternoon -- but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter .-- Ha !
I think Miss Fairfax dances very well ; and Mrs . Weston is the very best country - dance player , without exception , in England .
He felt the going away almost too much to speak of it .
Remember ."
Look at her .
replied he .
" I have heard her speak of the acquaintance ," said Emma ; " she is a very elegant young woman ."
Perry ."
" Oh !
and I always thought you meant it ."
The last night ' s ball seemed lost in the gipsies .
Mr . Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls , and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in .
" Ah !
I did not know what to do .
Emma listened , and looked , and soon perceived that Frank Churchill ' s state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of humour .
The hasty engagement she had entered into with that woman -- Here , my dear madam , I was obliged to leave off abruptly , to recollect and compose myself .-- I have been walking over the country , and am now , I hope , rational enough to make the rest of my letter what it ought to be .-- It is , in fact , a most mortifying retrospect for me .
I know we agreed never to name him -- but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else , I should not have thought it possible that I could be supposed to mean any other person .
Mrs . Bates was engaged to spend the evening at Hartfield , James had due notice , and he sanguinely hoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear little John would have any thing the matter with them , while dear Emma were gone .
He could not understand it ; but there were symptoms of intelligence between them -- he thought so at least -- symptoms of admiration on his side , which , having once observed , he could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning , however he might wish to escape any of Emma ' s errors of imagination .
" Yes , Mr . Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons ; and I thought it a very strong proof ."
She was disgustingly , was suspiciously reserved .
asked Isabella in the plaintive tone which just suited her father .
she is absolutely charming !
There was no want of likeness , she had been fortunate in the attitude , and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure , to give a little more height , and considerably more elegance , she had great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last , and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both -- a standing memorial of the beauty of one , the skill of the other , and the friendship of both ; with as many other agreeable associations as Mr . Elton ' s very promising attachment was likely to add .
It was her superior duty .
" This man is almost too gallant to be in love ," thought Emma .
Her introductions and recommendations must all wait , and every projected party be still only talked of .
Beyond it she would on no account proceed .
Mrs . Elton was first seen at church : but though devotion might be interrupted , curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew , and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid , to settle whether she were very pretty indeed , or only rather pretty , or not pretty at all .
She thought well of Frank in almost every respect ; and , what was more , she loved him very much , and her defence was , therefore , earnest .
What was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body ; and he had , therefore , earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any wedding - cake at all , and when that proved vain , as earnestly tried to prevent any body ' s eating it .
" A very pretty trick you have been playing me , upon my word !
Voices approached the shop -- or rather one voice and two ladies : Mrs . Weston and Miss Bates met them at the door .
" I should say so , but that I suppose there may be a hundred different ways of being in love .
" Poor Mr . and Miss Woodhouse , if you please ; but I cannot possibly say ` poor Miss Taylor .'
In my Bath life , I have seen such instances of it !
CHAPTER XV
" You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill , I presume ," he continued -- " and know him to be my son , though he does not bear my name ."
Emma smiled , and felt that Mr . Weston had very good reason for saying so .
Nobody could be so imprudent !
She would not let Jane say , ` No ;' for when Jane first heard of it , ( it was the day before yesterday , the very morning we were at Donwell ,) when Jane first heard of it , she was quite decided against accepting the offer , and for the reasons you mention ; exactly as you say , she had made up her mind to close with nothing till Colonel Campbell ' s return , and nothing should induce her to enter into any engagement at present -- and so she told Mrs . Elton over and over again -- and I am sure I had no more idea that she would change her mind !-- but that good Mrs . Elton , whose judgment never fails her , saw farther than I did .
Emma spoke her pity so very kindly , that with a sudden accession of gay thought , he cried ,
Mrs . Weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem .
They never could have been all three together , without her having stabbed Jane Fairfax ' s peace in a thousand instances ; and on Box Hill , perhaps , it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no more .
" No -- It will not be worth while .
Thy ready wit the word will soon supply , May its approval beam in that soft eye !
I certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than I do .
It soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement .
That is the key to a great deal of capacity .
She could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty .
Well , what do you say to it ?-- I always told you he would be here again soon , did not I ?-- Anne , my dear , did not I always tell you so , and you would not believe me ?-- In town next week , you see -- at the latest , I dare say ; for _she_ is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done ; most likely they will be there to - morrow or Saturday .
And what inclines one less to bear , she has no fair pretence of family or blood .
This is delightful , is not it ?-- Where ' s dear Mr .
Oh !
It was being very deficient ."
Emma ' s politeness was at hand directly , to say , with smiling interest --
" But you need not imagine Mr . Weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up Henry or John .
" Harriet !"
As to myself , I am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings -- Nothing could be farther from my wishes -- your attachment to my friend Harriet -- your pursuit of her , ( pursuit , it appeared ,) gave me great pleasure , and I have been very earnestly wishing you success : but had I supposed that she were not your attraction to Hartfield , I should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent .
Perhaps I may sometimes have felt that Harriet would not forget what was due -- or rather what would be kind by me ."
It was almost enough to make her think of marrying .
" It is so , indeed ," continued Mr . Knightley ; " I have it from Robert Martin himself .
The older a person grows , Harriet , the more important it is that their manners should not be bad ; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness , or coarseness , or awkwardness becomes .
But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this , he trusted his dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable ; it was , that he should be received at Hartfield ; that so long as her father ' s happiness in other words his life -- required Hartfield to continue her home , it should be his likewise .
you were perfectly right !
Emma scarcely heard what was said .-- Her mind was divided between two ideas -- her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax ; and poor Harriet ;-- and for some time she could only exclaim , and require confirmation , repeated confirmation .
I want to see you permanently well connected , and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd acquaintance as may be ; and , therefore , I say that if you should still be in this country when Mr . Martin marries , I wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters , to be acquainted with the wife , who will probably be some mere farmer ' s daughter , without education ."
_Miss_ _Woodhouse_ appeared more than once , and never without a something of pleasing connexion , either a compliment to her taste , or a remembrance of what she had said ; and in the very last time of its meeting her eye , unadorned as it was by any such broad wreath of gallantry , she yet could discern the effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all conveyed .
It was known that they were a little acquainted ; but not a syllable of real information could Emma procure as to what he truly was .
" Then , my dear Isabella , it is the most extraordinary sort of thing in the world , for in general every thing does give you cold .
" Open the windows !-- but surely , Mr . Churchill , nobody would think of opening the windows at Randalls .
I am sure Miss Nash would -- for Miss Nash thinks her own sister very well married , and it is only a linen - draper ."
" No -- Mrs . Knightley ;-- and till she is in being , I will manage such matters myself ."
As the door opened she was heard ,
But , perhaps -- I may be equally in the way here .
" You had better order the carriage directly , my love ," said she ; " I dare say we shall be able to get along , if we set off directly ; and if we do come to any thing very bad , I can get out and walk .
he cried .
Harriet could just answer , " Oh !
She would rather busy herself about any thing than speak .
Knightley ' s words dwelt with her .
Frank turned instantly to Emma , to claim her former promise ; and boasted himself an engaged man , which his father looked his most perfect approbation of -- and it then appeared that Mrs . Weston was wanting _him_ to dance with Mrs . Elton himself , and that their business was to help to persuade him into it , which was done pretty soon .-- Mr . Weston and Mrs . Elton led the way , Mr . Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed .
" It is so , indeed ," continued Mr . Knightley ; " I have it from Robert Martin himself .
" Thank you , dear Miss Woodhouse , you are all kindness .-- It is impossible to say -- Yes , indeed , I quite understand -- dearest Jane ' s prospects -- that is , I do not mean .-- But she is charmingly recovered .-- How is Mr .
And to propose that she and I should unite to form a musical club !
I hardly ever get a letter ."
no , no , no -- how can you suspect me of such a thing ?
Emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced Mr . Dixon ' s actions from his wife , or of any thing mischievous which her imagination had suggested at first .
This has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed .
" I certainly must ," said she .
Mr . John Knightley must be in town again on the 28th , and we ought to be thankful , papa , that we are to have the whole of the time they can give to the country , that two or three days are not to be taken out for the Abbey .
My regard for Hartfield is most warm "--
She heard enough to know that Mr . Weston was giving some information about his son ; she heard the words " my son ," and " Frank ," and " my son ," repeated several times over ; and , from a few other half - syllables very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son ; but before she could quiet Mr . Elton , the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her would have been awkward .
I am sure I have not got one half so good ."
What are Harriet Smith ' s claims , either of birth , nature or education , to any connexion higher than Robert Martin ?
Mrs . and Miss Bates occupied the drawing - room floor ; and there , in the very moderate - sized apartment , which was every thing to them , the visitors were most cordially and even gratefully welcomed ; the quiet neat old lady , who with her knitting was seated in the warmest corner , wanting even to give up her place to Miss Woodhouse , and her more active , talking daughter , almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness , thanks for their visit , solicitude for their shoes , anxious inquiries after Mr . Woodhouse ' s health , cheerful communications about her mother ' s , and sweet - cake from the beaufet --" Mrs . Cole had just been there , just called in for ten minutes , and had been so good as to sit an hour with them , and _she_ had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she liked it very much ; and , therefore , she hoped Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too ."
I never hear better sense from any one than Robert Martin .
We must remember to let James know that the carriage will be wanted on Tuesday .
Now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus -- so she was rather disappointed , but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body , for fear of its getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse , who would be so very much concerned !-- Well , this is brilliant !
Or Miss Bates ?
