He seems perfectly unprepared for that ."
He must think himself a most agreeable fellow ; I could not do such a thing .
Harriet ' s sweet easy temper will not mind it ."
He shook his head with a smile , and looked as if he had very little doubt and very little mercy .
" Are you well , my Emma ?"
" Indifferent !
This was Mr . Elton !
What a pity it is that Mr . Weston ever thought of her !"
" Ah !
Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business to be going forward just at this time ?-- Do you imagine it to be the consequence of an immediate commission from him , or that he may have sent only a general direction , an order indefinite as to time , to depend upon contingencies and conveniences ?"
To be sitting long after dinner , was a confinement that he could not endure .
One good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal ,-- the ball at the Crown .
" And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her !
Harriet was very ready to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening games ; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good - humoured and obliging .
What would you advise me to do ?
A circumstance rather unlucky occurred .
Mr . Elton is good - humoured , cheerful , obliging , and gentle .
No , the young lady , to be sure .
He had never been in the room at the Crown in his life -- did not know the people who kept it by sight .-- Oh !
Mrs . Weston ought to have found more in it , for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him ; but though she had one sort of spirit , she had not the best .
Emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love .
Respect would be added to affection .
She has a fault .
` Oh !'
If _we_ exert ourselves , I think we shall not be long in want of allies .
It was a happy circumstance , and animated Mr . Woodhouse for some time .
I could do very well without it .
Emma saw him only once ; but two or three times every day Harriet was sure _just_ to meet with him , or _just_ to miss him , _just_ to hear his voice , or see his shoulder , _just_ to have something occur to preserve him in her fancy , in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture .
I should like to see Emma in love , and in some doubt of a return ; it would do her good .
Exquisite , quite exquisite !-- Still , however , having proceeded so far , one is unwilling to give the matter up .
" I am very sure that I never said any thing of either to the other , which both might not have heard ."
I was glad you made her play so much , for having no instrument at her grandmother ' s , it must have been a real indulgence ."
" But I thought you would .
" Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell ," said she , in a voice of forced calmness , " I can imagine nothing with any confidence .
and I have often wished -- but it is so little one can venture to do -- small , trifling presents , of any thing uncommon -- Now we have killed a porker , and Emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg ; it is very small and delicate -- Hartfield pork is not like any other pork -- but still it is pork -- and , my dear Emma , unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks , nicely fried , as ours are fried , without the smallest grease , and not roast it , for no stomach can bear roast pork -- I think we had better send the leg -- do not you think so , my dear ?"
I am sure she will be pleased with the children .
thought Emma .
The scene enlarged ; two persons appeared ; Mrs . Weston and her son - in - law ; they were walking into Highbury ;-- to Hartfield of course .
It is natural , and it is honourable .-- Yes , honourable , I think , to chuse so well and so gratefully .-- But that it will be a fortunate preference is more that I can promise .
I shall soon have done .
But she had not been there two minutes when she found that Harriet ' s habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too , and that , in short , they would both be soon after her .
Nobody cares for a letter ; the thing is , to be always happy with pleasant companions .
With all my heart .
I am all amazement !
That , you know , was so very .
I am perfectly comfortable to - day ."
Emma made no answer , and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned , but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone .
" Oh !"
" I hope he does ," replied Mr . Knightley coolly , and resuming the letter .
" And after all , five couple are not enough to make it worth while to stand up .
She remembered what Mr . Knightley had once said to her about Mr . Elton , the caution he had given , the conviction he had professed that Mr . Elton would never marry indiscreetly ; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself .
" How do you do , Mrs . Ford ?
" I shall never be easy till I have seen some of these places .
" Very pretty , sir , upon my word ; to send me on here , to be an encumbrance to my friends , so long before you vouchsafe to come !-- But you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with .
Be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited .
She is loveliness itself .
I could do very well without it .
But this does not acquit _him_ , Mrs . Weston ; and I must say , that I think him greatly to blame .
What could he mean by such horrible indelicacy ?
CHAPTER VIII
" I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you , Miss Woodhouse ," she shortly afterwards began , " since the party to Box Hill .
Fourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six months ago !-- Emma could not but picture it all , and feel how justly they might resent , how naturally Harriet must suffer .
God knows , I have been a very indifferent lover .-- But you understand me .-- Yes , you see , you understand my feelings -- and will return them if you can .
Elton , and Miss Hawkins !-- Good morning to you ."
Mr . John Knightley must be in town again on the 28th , and we ought to be thankful , papa , that we are to have the whole of the time they can give to the country , that two or three days are not to be taken out for the Abbey .
She is known only as parlour - boarder at a common school .
Where the wound had been given , there must the cure be found if anywhere ; and Emma felt that , till she saw her in the way of cure , there could be no true peace for herself .
She did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the inferiority of her own playing and singing .
And to propose that she and I should unite to form a musical club !
" To be sure , so it is .
They were interrupted .
That ' s a consideration indeed .-- But John , as to what I was telling you of my idea of moving the path to Langham , of turning it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows , I cannot conceive any difficulty .
" Well , Mrs . Weston ," said Emma triumphantly when he left them , " what do you say now to Mr . Knightley ' s marrying Jane Fairfax ?"
All this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath ; and Emma said something very civil about the excellence of Miss Fairfax ' s handwriting .
Papa , if you speak in that melancholy way , you will be giving Isabella a false idea of us all .
Dear me !
Who cried most ?"
_Now_ I shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you ."
Where a man does his best with only moderate powers , he will have the advantage over negligent superiority .
Jane ' s curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to occupy her .
I cannot see you acting wrong , without a remonstrance .
I long to make apologies , excuses , to urge something for myself .
Frank was next to Emma , Jane opposite to them -- and Mr . Knightley so placed as to see them all ; and it was his object to see as much as he could , with as little apparent observation .
so long ago as the 7th of November , ( as I am going to read to you ,) and has never been well since .
The impossibility of her quitting her father , Mr . Knightley felt as strongly as herself ; but the inadmissibility of any other change , he could not agree to .
" What two letters !-- express perfection !
She then broke the lace off short , and dexterously throwing it into a ditch , was presently obliged to entreat them to stop , and acknowledged her inability to put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort .
He presently added , with a smile ,
" In short ," said he , " perhaps , Miss Woodhouse -- I think you can hardly be quite without suspicion "--
CHAPTER II
Come on a donkey , however , if you prefer it .
I think he is just the person to do it , even without being in love ."
Could the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance !-- But of that , unfortunately , there could be no chance .
" I never should have presumed to think of it at first ," said she , " but for you .
He came back gay and self - satisfied , eager and busy , caring nothing for Miss Woodhouse , and defying Miss Smith .
In so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her .
I must love him ; and now that I am satisfied on one point , the one material point , I am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well , and ready to hope that it may .
You will see her to advantage ; see her and hear her -- no , I am afraid you will not hear her at all , for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue ."
" Yes ."
" Robert Martin has no great loss -- if he can but think so ; and I hope it will not be long before he does .
