" And then their uncle comes in , and tosses them up to the ceiling in a very frightful way !"
Stokes .-- Every body invited , was certainly to come ; Frank had already written to Enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his fortnight , which could not possibly be refused .
They might advance rapidly if they would , however ; they must advance somehow or other whether they would or no .
She proved to be the daughter of a tradesman , rich enough to afford her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers , and decent enough to have always wished for concealment .-- Such was the blood of gentility which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for !-- It was likely to be as untainted , perhaps , as the blood of many a gentleman : but what a connexion had she been preparing for Mr . Knightley -- or for the Churchills -- or even for Mr .
But she was not at all sorry that she had abused the housekeeper the other day .-- Shocking plan , living together .
" You forget how much she belongs to Highbury .
And to propose that she and I should unite to form a musical club !
The housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected .-- Very extraordinary !-- And nobody knew at all which way he was gone .
" You are right .
It would be a great disappointment to Mr . John Knightley ; consequently to Isabella .
" It is one that I shall never change , however ."
A Miss Hawkins -- that ' s all I know .
Where features were indifferent , a fine complexion gave beauty to them all ; and where they were good , the effect was -- fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the effect was .
But it should be so no more .
By your account , he does seem to have had some scruples .
I have seen you only as the admirer of my friend .
"` Smallridge !'
Manners were all that could be safely judged of , under a much longer knowledge than they had yet had of Mr . Churchill .
" Emma never thinks of herself , if she can do good to others ," rejoined Mr . Woodhouse , understanding but in part .
She resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at Hartfield .
She and Mr . Frank Churchill had been at Weymouth at the same time .
Oh !
The good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before ."
When they all sat down it was better ; to her taste a great deal better , for Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay , making her his first object .
Her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits , inconsistency of action , and inequality of powers ; and it mortified her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling , or esteemed so little worthy as a friend : but she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good , and of being able to say to herself , that could Mr . Knightley have been privy to all her attempts of assisting Jane Fairfax , could he even have seen into her heart , he would not , on this occasion , have found any thing to reprove .
Oh !
_Courtship_ -- a very good hint .
Time , she knew , must be allowed for this being thoroughly done ; and she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general , and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr . Elton in particular ; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet ' s age , and with the entire extinction of all hope , such a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr . Elton ' s return , as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance , without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them .
All that were good would be withdrawn ; and if to these losses , the loss of Donwell were to be added , what would remain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach ?
It would hold the very number for comfort .
succeeded in the true English style , burying under a calmness that seemed all but indifference , the real attachment which would have led either of them , if requisite , to do every thing for the good of the other .
" No , no ; your room is full enough .
I shall sit by you .
The cold , however , was severe ; and by the time the second carriage was in motion , a few flakes of snow were finding their way down , and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time .
he could ride to London at any time .
And I have no doubt that he _will_ thrive , and be a very rich man in time -- and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb _us_ ."
Had he said any thing to bear a different construction , I should not have believed him ."
As far as good intentions went , we were _both_ right , and I must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong .
" I cannot agree with you , papa ; you know I cannot .
How often have I heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her !"
So I begged he would not -- for really as to ours being gone , I could not absolutely say that we had a great many left -- it was but half a dozen indeed ; but they should be all kept for Jane ; and I could not at all bear that he should be sending us more , so liberal as he had been already ; and Jane said the same .
The case is , you see , that the Campbells are going to Ireland .
Weston !-- Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a gentlewoman !
Mr . Knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort !-- No longer walking in at all hours , as if ever willing to change his own home for their ' s !-- How was it to be endured ?
The ground covered with snow , and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw , which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise , every morning beginning in rain or snow , and every evening setting in to freeze , she was for many days a most honourable prisoner .
Mr . Elton ' s situation was most suitable , quite the gentleman himself , and without low connexions ; at the same time , not of any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet .
" If I understand your brother , he only means so far as your having some thoughts of marrying .
It was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage .
The lovers were standing together at one of the windows .
Emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour .
" This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted , and Mr . Weston has done very well for himself ; but he must have knocked up every body else .
The nature and the simplicity of gentlemen and ladies , with their servants and furniture , I think is best observed by meals within doors .
I thought you had lost half your property , at least .
She had always wanted to do every thing , and had made more progress both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to .
Her heart had been long growing kinder towards Jane ; and this picture of her present sufferings acted as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion , and left her nothing but pity ; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of the past , obliged her to admit that Jane might very naturally resolve on seeing Mrs . Cole or any other steady friend , when she might not bear to see herself .
She had always wanted to do every thing , and had made more progress both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to .
He had a very fine flock , and , while she was with them , he had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country .
there is one difficulty unprovided for ," cried Emma .
I think he is just the person to do it , even without being in love ."
It is impossible ."
At last Jane began , and though the first bars were feebly given , the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to .
" What is the matter now ?"
" Not your vain spirit , but your serious spirit .-- If one leads you wrong , I am sure the other tells you of it ."
I had quite determined to go away again ."
How very odd !
" You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before ."
She had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait .
It is such enjoyment to them , that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of their taking turns , whichever began would never give way to the other ."
-- repeated Mr .
" Pray say no more .
Why does not he try Bath ?-- Indeed he should .
" That is as formidable an image as you could present , Harriet ; and if I thought I should ever be like Miss Bates !
" Yes ," said his brother hesitatingly , " there is a likeness .
" Something that would do !"
I am here till claimed by Colonel and Mrs .
He listened in perfect silence .
Emma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates , but she wished she had left her ten minutes earlier ;-- it would have been a great pleasure to talk over Jane Fairfax ' s situation with Mr .
" Worse than I had supposed .
Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell .
Frank Churchill ' s little inclination to exclude himself increased so much , that his last words to Emma were ,
Mrs . Elton is very good - natured and agreeable , and I dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought to be .
Ever since the service he rendered Jane at Weymouth , when they were out in that party on the water , and she , by the sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails , would have been dashed into the sea at once , and actually was all but gone , if he had not , with the greatest presence of mind , caught hold of her habit -- ( I can never think of it without trembling !)
You can have no superior , but most true on mine .-- She is a complete angel .
She has a fault .
He had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted , and he could sometimes act an ungracious , or say a severe thing .
Emma saw its artifice , and returned to her first surmises .
" Shall I ring the bell ?"
" There was a strong expectation of his coming soon after the marriage , but it ended in nothing ; and I have not heard him mentioned lately ."
He listened with all due deference ; acknowledged that he had heard many people say the same -- but yet he must confess , that to him nothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health .
I remember one evening the poor boys saying , ` Uncle seems always tired now .'"
No -- till Cole alluded to my supposed attachment , it had never entered my head .
" How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended .
" My Emma , he means no such thing .
" You understand the force of influence pretty well , Harriet ; but I would have you so firmly established in good society , as to be independent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse .
She must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing , but if he were criticising her behaviour , she did not feel afraid .
CHAPTER X
" Here have I ," said she , " actually talked poor Harriet into being very much attached to this man .
Elton had just joined them , and his wife was exclaiming ,
He heard Frank Churchill next say , with a glance towards Jane , " I will give it to her -- shall I ?"
We are growing a little too nice .
