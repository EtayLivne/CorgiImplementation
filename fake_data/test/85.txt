I knew the name , the place , I knew all about it , and instantly saw what she had been doing .
" I do not know what your opinion may be , Mrs . Weston ," said Mr . Knightley , " of this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith , but I think it a bad thing ."
" It is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion ," said Mr . Knightley .
" Oh , the difference of situation and habit !
Disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn .
I doubt whether he will return the compliment , and discover her to be a lady .
" But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired , papa ?"
" Oh !
snows a little I see ."
" A man ," said he , " must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks people to leave their own fireside , and encounter such a day as this , for the sake of coming to see him .
I am thwarted in every thing material .
"` Mr .
Emma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates , but she wished she had left her ten minutes earlier ;-- it would have been a great pleasure to talk over Jane Fairfax ' s situation with Mr .
It was most unlikely , therefore , that he should ever want his father ' s assistance .
Colonel Campbell is a very agreeable man , and Mrs . Campbell a friendly , warm - hearted woman .
Such events are very interesting , but the suspense of them cannot last long .
No ; he was talking to Mrs . Cole -- he was looking on unconcerned ; Jane was asked by somebody else , and he was still talking to Mrs . Cole .
The contrast between Mrs . Churchill ' s importance in the world , and Jane Fairfax ' s , struck her ; one was every thing , the other nothing -- and she sat musing on the difference of woman ' s destiny , and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed , till roused by Miss Bates ' s saying ,
People who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style ."
I never heard of such a thing .
" Will you be so kind ," said she , " when I am missed , as to say that I am gone home ?-- I am going this moment .-- My aunt is not aware how late it is , nor how long we have been absent -- but I am sure we shall be wanted , and I am determined to go directly .-- I have said nothing about it to any body .
Emma , on reaching home , called the housekeeper directly , to an examination of her stores ; and some arrowroot of very superior quality was speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note .
Such an end of the doleful disappointment of five weeks back !
Mr . Knightley , one moment more ; something of consequence -- so shocked !-- Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples !"
She brought no name , no blood , no alliance .
Emma waited the result with impatience , but not without strong hopes .
Do not forget your engagement ."
Mrs . Weston was acting no part , feigning no feelings in all that she said to him in favour of the event .-- She had been extremely surprized , never more so , than when Emma first opened the affair to her ; but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all , and had no scruple in urging him to the utmost .-- She had such a regard for Mr . Knightley , as to think he deserved even her dearest Emma ; and it was in every respect so proper , suitable , and unexceptionable a connexion , and in one respect , one point of the highest importance , so peculiarly eligible , so singularly fortunate , that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature , and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it , and wished it long ago .-- How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced their own home for Hartfield !
I must confess it is a recommendation to me .
" Poor creatures !
" And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain .
Mr . Weston is rather an easy , cheerful - tempered man , than a man of strong feelings ; he takes things as he finds them , and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other , depending , I suspect , much more upon what is called society for his comforts , that is , upon the power of eating and drinking , and playing whist with his neighbours five times a week , than upon family affection , or any thing that home affords ."
Emma longed to know what Frank ' s first opinion of Mrs . Elton might be ; how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress , and her smiles of graciousness .
They must not do less than others , or she should be exposed to odious suspicions , and imagined capable of pitiful resentment .
The joy , the gratitude , the exquisite delight of her sensations may be imagined .
Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell .
When once it had been read , there was no doing any thing , but lament and exclaim .
We must look to her one fault , and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement , to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment ."
They all seemed to remember the day , the hour , the party , the occasion -- to feel the same consciousness , the same regrets -- to be ready to return to the same good understanding ; and they were just growing again like themselves , ( Harriet , as Emma must suspect , as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy ,) when the carriage reappeared , and all was over .
But it is done ; we are reconciled , dearer , much dearer , than ever , and no moment ' s uneasiness can ever occur between us again .
I made her take her shawl -- for the evenings are not warm -- her large new shawl -- Mrs . Dixon ' s wedding - present .-- So kind of her to think of my mother !
" Yes -- rather -- I have been thinking of it some little time ."
Tea was carrying round , and Mr . Weston , having said all that he wanted , soon took the opportunity of walking away .
Soon after this Miss Bates came in , and Emma could not help being diverted by the perplexity of her first answer to herself , resulting , she supposed , from doubt of what might be said , and impatience to say every thing .
Very pleasant party .
I should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty , and she would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength and refinement .-- But I had no choice .
She had had many a hint from Mr . Knightley and some from her own heart , as to her deficiency -- but none were equal to counteract the persuasion of its being very disagreeable ,-- a waste of time -- tiresome women -- and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second - rate and third - rate of Highbury , who were calling on them for ever , and therefore she seldom went near them .
This would not do ; she immediately stopped , under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing of her half - boot , and stooping down in complete occupation of the footpath , begged them to have the goodness to walk on , and she would follow in half a minute .
But one morning -- I forget exactly the day -- but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before _that_ _evening_ , he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket - book ; it was about spruce - beer .
" I am not speaking of its prudence ; merely its probability ."
We shall soon overtake her .
Oh !
You have not heard all that you ought to hear .
" Might he not ?-- Is not it possible , that when enquiring , as you thought , into the state of your affections , he might be alluding to Mr . Martin -- he might have Mr . Martin ' s interest in view ?
One is so fenced and guarded from the weather , that not a breath of air can find its way unpermitted .
She did not do any of it in the same way that she used ; I could see she was altered ; but , however , she seemed to _try_ to be very friendly , and we shook hands , and stood talking some time ; but I know no more what I said -- I was in such a tremble !-- I remember she said she was sorry we never met now ; which I thought almost too kind !
" I can never think of it ," she cried , " without extreme shame ."
Mr . Weston had walked in .
Poor man !-- it was at first a considerable shock to him , and he tried earnestly to dissuade her from it .
He must have had a wet ride .-- Yes .-- He meant to walk with her , she found .
Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could , to keep him from such thoughts ; but when tea came , it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner ,
For a moment or two nothing was said , and she was unsuspicious of having excited any particular interest , till she found her arm drawn within his , and pressed against his heart , and heard him thus saying , in a tone of great sensibility , speaking low ,
I never compliment .
It was merely a blind to conceal his real situation with another .-- It was his object to blind all about him ; and no one , I am sure , could be more effectually blinded than myself -- except that I was _not_ blinded -- that it was my good fortune -- that , in short , I was somehow or other safe from him ."
I think you will agree with me , ( turning with a soft air to Emma ,) I think I shall certainly have your approbation , though Mr . Knightley perhaps , from being used to the large parties of London , may not quite enter into our feelings ."
Do not beat me ."
High in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities , was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from Mr . Knightley would soon be over .
Poor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that Emma could give .
Let me return your congratulations .-- I assure you that I have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction .-- He is a man whom I cannot presume to praise ."
She was quite convinced of Mr . Elton ' s being in the fairest way of falling in love , if not in love already .
" Yes , he has been gone just four weeks , as you observe , Miss Woodhouse ," said Miss Bates , " four weeks yesterday .-- A Miss Hawkins !-- Well , I had always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts ; not that I ever -- Mrs . Cole once whispered to me -- but I immediately said , ` No , Mr . Elton is a most worthy young man -- but '-- In short , I do not think I am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries .
The party did not break up without Emma ' s being positively secured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening , nor without her overhearing Mr . Weston whisper to his wife , " He has asked her , my dear .
Dear me !
And how could it possibly come into your head ?"
" The ladies were all at home ."
" Nay , I had it from you .
Jane desired me to do it , so I always do : and so I began to - day with my usual caution ; but no sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell , than I burst out , quite frightened , with ` Bless me !
Time , however , she thought , would tell him that they ought to be friends again .
" Mr . Knightley was there too , was he ?"
.
She determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers .
very delightful indeed ; I can say nothing less , for I suppose Miss Woodhouse and Mr . Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that passes .
They might be more safely held up as a pattern .
But ah !
" My advice ," said Mrs . Weston kindly and persuasively , " I certainly do feel tempted to give .
yes -- very -- a very pleasing young woman ."
-- for presently she came forward -- came quite up to me , and asked me how I did , and seemed ready to shake hands , if I would .
But you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own .
My heart was in Highbury , and my business was to get my body thither as often as might be , and with the least suspicion .
By this time , the walk in the rain had reached Mrs . Elton , and her remonstrances now opened upon Jane .
Come , and eat my strawberries .
He thought she had undertaken more than she was equal to , and that she felt it so herself , though she would not own it .
Here is the rivet of your mistress ' s spectacles out .
One good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal ,-- the ball at the Crown .
Emma was just describing the nature of her friend ' s complaint ;-- " a throat very much inflamed , with a great deal of heat about her , a quick , low pulse , & c . and she was sorry to find from Mrs . Goddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore - throats , and had often alarmed her with them ."
-- for presently she came forward -- came quite up to me , and asked me how I did , and seemed ready to shake hands , if I would .
I have no doubt of his having , at times , considerable influence ; but it may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand _when_ it will be ."
If attention , in future , could do away the past , she might hope to be forgiven .
" Here is his answer , if you like to see it ."
I have no business to put myself forward ."
