Yes , that will be quite enough for pleasure .
The gruel came and supplied a great deal to be said -- much praise and many comments -- undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution , and pretty severe Philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with tolerable ;-- but , unfortunately , among the failures which the daughter had to instance , the most recent , and therefore most prominent , was in her own cook at South End , a young woman hired for the time , who never had been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel , thin , but not too thin .
Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax , escorted by the two gentlemen , walked into the room ; and Mrs . Elton seemed to think it as much her duty as Mrs . Weston ' s to receive them .
Poor Miss Bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated , in spite of the very natural wish of a little change ."
But Jane , it seems , had a letter from them very lately , and not a word was said about it .
FINIS
By a most fortunate chance his leaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance at this critical moment .
You know I candidly told you I should form my own opinion ; and I am happy to say that I am extremely pleased with him .-- You may believe me .
" I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her .
It was foolish , it was wrong , to take so active a part in bringing any two people together .
You see we have been wedging one leg with paper .
Frank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch ; and though he did not say much , his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening .
We must allow for the effect of shade , you know ."
Mrs . Weston ' s partiality for him is very great , and , as you may suppose , most gratifying to me .
Harriet smiled again , and her smiles grew stronger .
For a few days , every morning visit in Highbury included some mention of the handsome letter Mrs . Weston had received .
" Well ," said Mrs . Elton , laughing , " we shall see ."
Mr . Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled ; but the worst was overcome , the idea was given ; time and continual repetition must do the rest .-- To Emma ' s entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr . Knightley ' s , whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome ; and he was soon used to be talked to by each , on every fair occasion .-- They had all the assistance which Isabella could give , by letters of the strongest approbation ; and Mrs . Weston was ready , on the first meeting , to consider the subject in the most serviceable light -- first , as a settled , and , secondly , as a good one -- well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to Mr . Woodhouse ' s mind .-- It was agreed upon , as what was to be ; and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness ; and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it , he began to think that some time or other -- in another year or two , perhaps -- it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place .
Could the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance !-- But of that , unfortunately , there could be no chance .
" I shall never let that book go out of my own hands ," said she .
It was a private resolution of hers , not communicated to him -- or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction .-- Till yesterday , I know he said he was in the dark as to her plans .
I believe I was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper ."
Delightful , charming , superior , first circles , spheres , lines , ranks , every thing -- and Mrs . Elton was wild to have the offer closed with immediately .-- On her side , all was warmth , energy , and triumph -- and she positively refused to take her friend ' s negative , though Miss Fairfax continued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing , repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before .-- Still Mrs . Elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence by the morrow ' s post .-- How Jane could bear it at all , was astonishing to Emma .-- She did look vexed , she did speak pointedly -- and at last , with a decision of action unusual to her , proposed a removal .-- " Should not they walk ?
I like old friends ; and Miss Jane Fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady , a very pretty and a very well - behaved young lady indeed .
Mr . Weston ' s ball was to be a real thing .
" Our little friend Harriet Smith , however , is just such another pretty kind of young person .
I will not say quite all .
For a moment he was silent ; and then added , in a tone much more guarded and demure ,
I said to my mother , ` Upon my word , ma ' am --.'
It was the very circumstance he could have wished for .
Indeed , when the time draws on , I shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche - landau ; it will be so very much preferable .
So very good of them to send her the whole way !
" Perhaps she might ; but it is not every man ' s fate to marry the woman who loves him best .
" Yes -- what should hurt me ?-- I walk fast .
We must allow for the effect of shade , you know ."
Mrs . Weston , with her baby on her knee , indulging in such reflections as these , was one of the happiest women in the world .
The character of Mrs . Churchill , the grief of her husband -- her mind glanced over them both with awe and compassion -- and then rested with lightened feelings on how Frank might be affected by the event , how benefited , how freed .
The older a person grows , Harriet , the more important it is that their manners should not be bad ; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness , or coarseness , or awkwardness becomes .
no ; there would be a Mrs . Knightley to throw cold water on every thing .-- Extremely disagreeable !
" That is very likely .
Emma sat with her as long as she could , to attend her in Mrs . Goddard ' s unavoidable absences , and raise her spirits by representing how much Mr . Elton ' s would be depressed when he knew her state ; and left her at last tolerably comfortable , in the sweet dependence of his having a most comfortless visit , and of their all missing her very much .
" Yes -- I imagined -- that is -- I did not --"
All looked up to them .
" Mr . Knightley I declare !-- I must speak to him if possible , just to thank him .
She thinks nobody equal to him ."
But -- that he should talk of encouragement , should consider her as aware of his views , accepting his attentions , meaning ( in short ), to marry him !-- should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind !-- look down upon her friend , so well understanding the gradations of rank below him , and be so blind to what rose above , as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her !-- It was most provoking .
" You are extremely kind ," replied Miss Bates , highly gratified ; " you who are such a judge , and write so beautifully yourself .
It was a pity that she had not come back earlier !
" I am almost certain that the meeting at the Crown is not till to - morrow .-- Mr .
" Yes -- I have some right to that knowledge ; though I have never been at the place in my life .-- She is an odd woman !-- But I never allow myself to speak ill of her , on Frank ' s account ; for I do believe her to be very fond of him .
" But they like it , papa ; there is nothing they like so much .
An arch look expressed --" I understand you well enough ;" but she said only , " Miss Fairfax is reserved ."
There is a littleness about him which you discovered , and which I did not : and I was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet .
She and Mrs . Weston were obliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together .
" I hope every body had a pleasant evening ," said Mr . Woodhouse , in his quiet way .
She checked herself , however , and submitted quietly to a little more praise than she deserved .
How I catch myself out !
They had a very fine day for Box Hill ; and all the other outward circumstances of arrangement , accommodation , and punctuality , were in favour of a pleasant party .
The weather does not look well , and grandmama will be uneasy .
Miss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour ; and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself , or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect .
" This is a pleasure ," said he , in rather a low voice , " coming at least ten minutes earlier than I had calculated .
if you had seen her , as I did , when she was at the worst !"
Jane Fairfax ' s perception seemed to accompany his ; her comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning , the superior intelligence , of those five letters so arranged .
You will stay , and go with us ?"
Your views for Harriet are best known to yourself ; but as you make no secret of your love of match - making , it is fair to suppose that views , and plans , and projects you have ;-- and as a friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton is the man , I think it will be all labour in vain ."
" From the very circumstance of its being larger , sir .
" We thought you were to bring them ."
Mr . Knightley , he is _not_ a trifling , silly young man .
Look at her .
They combated the point some time longer in the same way ; Emma rather gaining ground over the mind of her friend ; for Mrs . Weston was the most used of the two to yield ; till a little bustle in the room shewed them that tea was over , and the instrument in preparation ;-- and at the same moment Mr . Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse would do them the honour of trying it .
How , where , when ?-- Let me know it all .
I had no right to expect much , and I did not expect much ; but I had no idea that he could be so very clownish , so totally without air .
Knightley ' s .-- Alas !
It would amuse away the difficulties of her part , and lessen the irksomeness of Miss Smith ' s ."
What will it answer ?
It will give you every thing that you want -- consideration , independence , a proper home -- it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends , close to Hartfield and to me , and confirm our intimacy for ever .
" Do you dare to suppose me so great a blockhead , as not to know what a man is talking of ?-- What do you deserve ?"
You would have thrown yourself out of all good society .
" That I am sure you would .
but what shall you do ?
Mr . Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea , and was repeating , " No husbands and wives in the case at present indeed , as you observe .
" You think I ought to refuse him then ," said Harriet , looking down .
" Oh !
Much beyond my hopes .
This , Harriet , is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us ."
The gentlemen spoke of his horse .
Upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated .
CHAPTER V
The invitation was refused , and by a verbal message .
" Oh !
The business was finished , and Harriet safe .
" Oh , what a sweet house !-- How very beautiful !-- There are the yellow curtains that Miss Nash admires so much ."
" This was really his ," said Harriet .--" Do not you remember one morning ?-- no , I dare say you do not .
You like news -- and I heard an article in my way hither that I think will interest you ."
Mr . Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe , which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command , as well as the route and the method of his journey ; and she listened , and smiled , and congratulated .
Emma ' s comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on , by Harriet ' s being to stay longer ; her fortnight was likely to be a month at least .
" Depend upon it , Emma , a sensible man would find no difficulty in it .
" I had a few lines on parish business from Mr . Weston this morning , and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened ."
I would give any money for it .
No husbands and wives ," with so interesting a consciousness , that Emma began to consider whether she had not better leave them together at once .
