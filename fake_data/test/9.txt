They will soon be in Yorkshire .
" Well , well , means to make her an offer then .
She tried to stop him ; but vainly ; he would go on , and say it all .
But this was not judged feasible .
" In that respect how unlike dear Mrs . Elton , who wants to be wiser and wittier than all the world !
Vigorous , decided , with sentiments to a certain point , not coarse .
Keep your raptures for Harriet ' s face .
Mrs . Weston looked , and looked in vain .
And though the consequent shock and alarm was very great and much more durable -- indeed I believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again -- yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable .
" Read it , read it ," said he , " it will give you pleasure ; only a few lines -- will not take you long ; read it to Emma ."
He began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick - chamber again , for the present -- to entreat her to _promise_ _him_ not to venture into such hazard till he had seen Mr . Perry and learnt his opinion ; and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course , there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her .
One morning , about ten days after Mrs . Churchill ' s decease , Emma was called downstairs to Mr . Weston , who " could not stay five minutes , and wanted particularly to speak with her ."
Harriet could just answer , " Oh !
Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed , without reproaches , or apparent sense of ill - usage ; and yet Emma fancied there was a something of resentment , a something bordering on it in her style , which increased the desirableness of their being separate .-- It might be only her own consciousness ; but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke .
you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate ."
You were very popular before you came , because you were Mr . Weston ' s son -- but lay out half a guinea at Ford ' s , and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues ."
Mr . Knightley had spoken prophetically , when he once said , " Emma , you have been no friend to Harriet Smith ."
leave all that to me .
" Yes , he has been gone just four weeks , as you observe , Miss Woodhouse ," said Miss Bates , " four weeks yesterday .-- A Miss Hawkins !-- Well , I had always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts ; not that I ever -- Mrs . Cole once whispered to me -- but I immediately said , ` No , Mr . Elton is a most worthy young man -- but '-- In short , I do not think I am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries .
Your meaning must be unequivocal ; no doubts or demurs : and such expressions of gratitude and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires , will present themselves unbidden to _your_ mind , I am persuaded .
" Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment ."
You have cured her of her school - girl ' s giggle ; she really does you credit ."
I have been silent from surprize merely , excessive surprize .
A little curiosity Emma had ; and she made the most of it while her friend related .
Nobody had any information to give ; and , after a few more wonderings , Emma said ,
She will not even listen to your questions .
He had come , in his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill ' s engagement , with no selfish view , no view at all , but of endeavouring , if she allowed him an opening , to soothe or to counsel her .-- The rest had been the work of the moment , the immediate effect of what he heard , on his feelings .
Mr . Weston seems an excellent creature -- quite a first - rate favourite with me already , I assure you .
" I have often thought them the worst of the two ," replied he coolly .
a man does not imagine any such thing .
She knew the importance of it , and said every thing in her power to do it away .
There was no resisting such news , no possibility of avoiding the influence of such a happy face as Mr . Weston ' s , confirmed as it all was by the words and the countenance of his wife , fewer and quieter , but not less to the purpose .
it is no difficulty to see who you take after !
She had not been prepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr . Elton ; but he was actually hurried off by Miss Bates , she jumped away from him at last abruptly to the Coles , to usher in a letter from her niece .
You are so kind !"
" What is the matter , sir ?-- Did you speak to me ?"
A crowd in a little room -- Miss Woodhouse , you have the art of giving pictures in a few words .
I wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance , in being able to pay her such attentions , as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father , when her society must be so irksome ."
Will not it be beautiful in her dark hair ?"
" I hope you will bring Elton ," said he : " but I will not trouble you to give any other invitations ."
She was proved to have been universally mistaken ; and she had not quite done nothing -- for she had done mischief .
What is to become of that ?-- Very true .
when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of court - plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about !
She liked his open manners , but a little less of open - heartedness would have made him a higher character .-- General benevolence , but not general friendship , made a man what he ought to be .-- She could fancy such a man .
I am perfectly comfortable to - day ."
He loved to have the cloth laid , because it had been the fashion of his youth , but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it ; and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing , his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat .
" Oh !
Dear Miss Woodhouse , do advise me ."
Receive it on my judgment .
Can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations ?
.
A man at his age -- what is he ?-- three or four - and - twenty -- cannot be without the means of doing as much as that .
Harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion .
" There does , indeed , seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present ," said Mrs . Weston , " as can well be ; and while she is so happy at Hartfield , I cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor Mr . Woodhouse ' s account .
To walk by the side of this child , and talk to and question her , was the most natural thing in the world , or would have been the most natural , had she been acting just then without design ; and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead , without any obligation of waiting for her .
She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate , indulgent father ; and had , in consequence of her sister ' s marriage , been mistress of his house from a very early period .
I should like to see Emma in love , and in some doubt of a return ; it would do her good .
I honour that part of the attention particularly ; it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart .
Encouragement should be given .
One accompaniment to her song took her agreeably by surprize -- a second , slightly but correctly taken by Frank Churchill .
At first , she thought it was a good deal ; and afterwards , but little .
" I cannot think there is any danger of it ," was Emma ' s calm answer -- " and when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax ' s situation and understand what her home has been , with Colonel and Mrs . Campbell , I have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown ."
The young man had been the first admirer , but she trusted there was no other hold , and that there would be no serious difficulty , on Harriet ' s side , to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own .
Only half an hour before her friend called for her at Mrs . Goddard ' s , her evil stars had led her to the very spot where , at that moment , a trunk , directed to _The_ _Rev . _ _Philip_ _Elton_ , _White - Hart_ , _Bath_ , was to be seen under the operation of being lifted into the butcher ' s cart , which was to convey it to where the coaches past ; and every thing in this world , excepting that trunk and the direction , was consequently a blank .
They were a family of the name of Martin , whom Emma well knew by character , as renting a large farm of Mr . Knightley , and residing in the parish of Donwell -- very creditably , she believed -- she knew Mr . Knightley thought highly of them -- but they must be coarse and unpolished , and very unfit to be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect .
" These matters are always a secret , till it is found out that every body knows them .
" I was with Mr . Cole on business an hour and a half ago .
It was not the gipsies -- it was not Mr . Frank Churchill that I meant .
It had a most favourable aspect ; and , for half a minute , Emma felt the glory of having schemed successfully .
She then took another line of expediency , and looking into the doubtful room , observed ,
" And really , I do not think the impression will soon be over ," said Emma , as she crossed the low hedge , and tottering footstep which ended the narrow , slippery path through the cottage garden , and brought them into the lane again .
She had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness ; and the person , whom she had been so many months neglecting , was now the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy .
" Mr . Weston do not trifle with me .-- Consider how many of my dearest friends are now in Brunswick Square .
So I said , I was very much obliged to him : you know I could not do less ; and then he went back to Elizabeth , and I came round by the stables -- I believe I did -- but I hardly knew where I was , or any thing about it .
On that article , truth seemed attainable .
Mr . Weston , his son , Emma , and Harriet , only remained ; and the young man ' s spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant .
She spoke with great agitation ; and Emma very feelingly replied , " That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now .
Under that peculiar sort of dry , blunt manner , I know you have the warmest heart .
My dear Miss Woodhouse -- I come quite over - powered .
" Yes , very true .
She was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist or a musician , but she was not unwilling to have others deceived , or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher than it deserved .
Dear Harriet , I give myself joy of this .
We never were so long without seeing her before , and as I was telling Mrs . Cole , we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now ."
Emma ' s pensive meditations , as she walked home , were not interrupted ; but on entering the parlour , she found those who must rouse her .
You could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I fell into .
Frank Churchill ' s character was not desperate .-- She was his own Emma , by hand and word , when they returned into the house ; and if he could have thought of Frank Churchill then , he might have deemed him a very good sort of fellow .
" I do not know why you should say so .
The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here , and stand very much in the same way -- just across the lawn ; and I had a glimpse of a fine large tree , with a bench round it , which put me so exactly in mind !
" Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming , Miss Woodhouse .-- I quite rave about Jane Fairfax .-- A sweet , interesting creature .
.
You must have heard every thing to be sure .
According to Miss Bates -- it all came from her -- Mrs . Dixon had written most pressingly .
But there is nobody hereabouts to attach her ; and she goes so seldom from home ."
Poor Mr . Woodhouse trembled as he sat , and , as Emma had foreseen , would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again .
CHAPTER XI
I would have her understand me .
If Emma had still , at intervals , an anxious feeling for Harriet , a momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her attachment to Mr . Knightley , and really able to accept another man from unbiased inclination , it was not long that she had to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty .
Her voice was not unsteady ; but her mind was in all the perturbation that such a development of self , such a burst of threatening evil , such a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions , must create .-- She listened with much inward suffering , but with great outward patience , to Harriet ' s detail .-- Methodical , or well arranged , or very well delivered , it could not be expected to be ; but it contained , when separated from all the feebleness and tautology of the narration , a substance to sink her spirit -- especially with the corroborating circumstances , which her own memory brought in favour of Mr . Knightley ' s most improved opinion of Harriet .
They are very , very kind in their visits .
He would soon be among them again ; Mr . Elton and his bride .
