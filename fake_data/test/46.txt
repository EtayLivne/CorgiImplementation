" Aye , very true , my dear ," cried the latter , though Jane had not spoken a word --" I was just going to say the same thing .
Natural enough !-- his own mind full of intrigue , that he should suspect it in others .-- Mystery ; Finesse -- how they pervert the understanding !
The conversation was here interrupted .
Weston ."
Two such she did not want .
She had reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold , and it was desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of her other complaint before the gentleman ' s return .
" Yes , Mr . Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons ; and I thought it a very strong proof ."
" I do not think he is conceited either , in general ," said Harriet , her conscience opposing such censure ; " at least , he is very good natured , and I shall always feel much obliged to him , and have a great regard for -- but that is quite a different thing from -- and you know , though he may like me , it does not follow that I should -- and certainly I must confess that since my visiting here I have seen people -- and if one comes to compare them , person and manners , there is no comparison at all , _one_ is so very handsome and agreeable .
I have been making discoveries and forming plans , just like yourself , and I must tell them while the idea is fresh .
I am losing all my bitterness against spoilt children , my dearest Emma .
good Mr . Perry -- how is he , sir ?"
Do you really think it a bad thing ?-- why so ?"
Emma could not have a better companion than Harriet ."
The touch seemed immediate .
" Who could have thought it ?
" I shall not give you any advice , Harriet .
She had taken up the idea , she supposed , and made every thing bend to it .
Her situation should secure your compassion .
no -- what an impudent dog I was !-- How could I dare --"
You seem shut out from every thing -- in the most complete retirement .-- And Mrs . Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion .
but those two lines are "--
Without scruple -- without apology -- without much apparent diffidence , Mr . Elton , the lover of Harriet , was professing himself _her_ lover .
" I do not know what I could imagine , but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers .
" What does all that signify ?
The landed property of Hartfield certainly was inconsiderable , being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate , to which all the rest of Highbury belonged ; but their fortune , from other sources , was such as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell Abbey itself , in every other kind of consequence ; and the Woodhouses had long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which Mr . Elton had first entered not two years ago , to make his way as he could , without any alliances but in trade , or any thing to recommend him to notice but his situation and his civility .-- But he had fancied her in love with him ; that evidently must have been his dependence ; and after raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head , Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and obliging , so full of courtesy and attention , as ( supposing her real motive unperceived ) might warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy , like Mr . Elton , in fancying himself a very decided favourite .
" Oh !
To be constantly living with an ill - tempered person , must be dreadful .
Two such could never be granted .
To be sure , the charade , with its " ready wit "-- but then the " soft eyes "-- in fact it suited neither ; it was a jumble without taste or truth .
" True , sir ; and Emma , because she had Miss Fairfax ."
Of all the sources of evil surrounding the former , since her coming to Highbury , she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst .
" To fall in with each other on such an errand as this ," thought Emma ; " to meet in a charitable scheme ; this will bring a great increase of love on each side .
Emma began to listen better .
Emma was soon perfectly satisfied of Mr . Martin ' s being no otherwise remembered , than as he furnished a contrast with Mr . Elton , of the utmost advantage to the latter .
" Both sir !
" Well ," said Emma , " I suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the idea , and I wish them very happy .
Being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling , I have been in no hurry with my congratulations ; but I hope it all went off tolerably well .
" My dear Miss Fairfax , young ladies are very sure to be cared for .-- I hope your good grand - mama and aunt are well .
" We can finish this some other time , you know .
Mrs . Weston -- it is too calm a censure .
" Dirty , sir !
Her father -- and Harriet .
I never can be blameless .
To complete every other recommendation , he had _almost_ told her that he loved her .
Arthur !-- How do you do ?
" The sooner every party breaks up , the better ."
" I was only going to observe , that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women , I cannot imagine them to be very frequent .
If any thing , you are too attentive .
-- She did not suspect him .
No , if he had believed me at all to share his feelings , he would not have been so wretched .
Of their all removing to Donwell , Emma had already had her own passing thoughts .
Never had the exquisite sight , smell , sensation of nature , tranquil , warm , and brilliant after a storm , been more attractive to her .
Gilbert ."
I never could comprehend how Mr . Weston could part with him .
that I had never seen her !"
a fine complimentary opening : But it is his way .
In so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her .
" I cannot make speeches , Emma :" he soon resumed ; and in a tone of such sincere , decided , intelligible tenderness as was tolerably convincing .--" If I loved you less , I might be able to talk about it more .
They had been speaking of it as they walked about Highbury the day before , and Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented her absence .
Her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted , and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy .
Happily it was not necessary to speak .
Elton !-- no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him ."
Mr . Weston ' s own happiness was indisputable .
And Jane Fairfax , too , of all women !"
This letter must make its way to Emma ' s feelings .
those dear little children .
` Full many a flower is born to blush unseen , ` And waste its fragrance on the desert air .'
" Well ," said Emma , " I suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the idea , and I wish them very happy .
There is to be no form or parade -- a sort of gipsy party .
" He knew nothing about it , Emma .
The heat was excessive ; he had never suffered any thing like it -- almost wished he had staid at home -- nothing killed him like heat -- he could bear any degree of cold , etc ., but heat was intolerable -- and he sat down , at the greatest possible distance from the slight remains of Mr . Woodhouse ' s fire , looking very deplorable .
Her own behaviour had been so very improper !
I dream of every body at Highbury when I am away -- and when I have gone through my particular friends , then I begin dreaming of Mr . and Mrs .
" What two letters !-- express perfection !
It would only be giving trouble and distress .
You are more likely to have done harm to yourself , than good to them , by interference ."
For two or three months longer I shall remain where I am , and as I am ."
So Emma thought , at least .
When this was over , Mr . Woodhouse gratefully observed , " It is very kind of you , Mr . Knightley , to come out at this late hour to call upon us .
" And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess ?-- I pity you .-- I thought you cleverer -- for , depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck .
I have another person ' s interest at present so much at heart , that I cannot think any longer about Frank Churchill .
She went , however ; and when they reached the farm , and she was to be put down , at the end of the broad , neat gravel walk , which led between espalier apple - trees to the front door , the sight of every thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before , was beginning to revive a little local agitation ; and when they parted , Emma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity , which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour .
" But , my dear sir , the difference of the journey ;-- only consider how great it would have been .-- An hundred miles , perhaps , instead of forty ."
" Yes ; my father is to join me here : we shall walk back together , and I must be off immediately .
Mrs . Dixon has persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly .
The worn - out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming ; and in the rapidity of half a moment ' s thought , she hoped Mr . Elton would now be talked of no more .
If Mr . and Mrs . Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning , we may talk it over , and see what can be done ."
Actually to discover that Mr . Knightley is a gentleman !
He was not hungry ; it would only make him hotter ."
It was also a very early speculation with Emma .
But on seeing them together , she became perfectly satisfied .
Miss Bates , in her real anxiety for Jane , could hardly stay even to be grateful , before she stept forward and put an end to all farther singing .
It is not in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of Knightley ."
" Very well -- and as Randalls , I suppose , is not likely to have less influence than heretofore , it strikes me as a possible thing , Emma , that Henry and John may be sometimes in the way .
All was safe and prosperous ; and as the removal of one solicitude generally makes way for another , Emma , being now certain of her ball , began to adopt as the next vexation Mr . Knightley ' s provoking indifference about it .
The thing would be for us all to come on donkeys , Jane , Miss Bates , and me -- and my caro sposo walking by .
but those two lines are "--
You like news -- and I heard an article in my way hither that I think will interest you ."
All this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath ; and Emma said something very civil about the excellence of Miss Fairfax ' s handwriting .
Then here is my last ,"-- unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman in small size , whole - length --" my last and my best -- my brother , Mr . John Knightley .-- This did not want much of being finished , when I put it away in a pet , and vowed I would never take another likeness .
