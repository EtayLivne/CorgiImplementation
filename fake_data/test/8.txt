He proved to me that he could afford it ; and that being the case , I was convinced he could not do better .
Mrs . Elton had received notice of it that morning , and was in raptures .
What right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged , and with manners so _very_ disengaged ?
These kind of things are very well at Christmas , when one is sitting round the fire ; but quite out of place , in my opinion , when one is exploring about the country in summer .
In one moment such a change !
I want you to call me something else , but I do not know what ."
When the visit was returned , Emma made up her mind .
Her mind was quite sick of Mr . Elton and the Martins .
The young man had been the first admirer , but she trusted there was no other hold , and that there would be no serious difficulty , on Harriet ' s side , to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own .
Mr . Knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to express ; and before he could make any reply , Mr . Woodhouse , whose thoughts were on the Bates ' s , said --
said she , as they proceeded -- speaking more to assist Mr . Weston in keeping his secret , than with any other view .
I want you to save yourself from greater pain .
You have made yourself too clear .
How very differently we feel !-- Not think they will do each other any good !
She was pondering , in the meanwhile , upon the possibility , without seeming very rude , of making her escape from Jane Fairfax ' s letter , and had almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse , when Miss Bates turned to her again and seized her attention .
She read the concluding lines , and was all flutter and happiness .
I was almost afraid you would be hurrying home ."
I have done with match - making indeed .
said he , turning his eyes towards Jane .
In general he was judged , throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury , with great candour ; liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man -- one who smiled so often and bowed so well ; but there was one spirit among them not to be softened , from its power of censure , by bows or smiles -- Mr . Knightley .
She was then obliged to be finished , and make her appearance .
When he did return , he sought out the child and took notice of her .
had she never brought Harriet forward !
" Yes , he has been gone just four weeks , as you observe , Miss Woodhouse ," said Miss Bates , " four weeks yesterday .-- A Miss Hawkins !-- Well , I had always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts ; not that I ever -- Mrs . Cole once whispered to me -- but I immediately said , ` No , Mr . Elton is a most worthy young man -- but '-- In short , I do not think I am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries .
Of all the sources of evil surrounding the former , since her coming to Highbury , she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst .
These days of confinement would have been , but for her private perplexities , remarkably comfortable , as such seclusion exactly suited her brother , whose feelings must always be of great importance to his companions ; and he had , besides , so thoroughly cleared off his ill - humour at Randalls , that his amiableness never failed him during the rest of his stay at Hartfield .
I do not know what she meant , but she asked me if I thought I should go and stay there again next summer ."
But this good old Mr . Woodhouse , I wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner .
Did you ever hear of that ?-- A water party ; and by some accident she was falling overboard .
She would not look again .
" I think , indeed ," said John Knightley pleasantly , " that Mr . Weston has some little claim .
" Emma , why is it that they are your enemies ?"
I am going to London , to spend a few days with John and Isabella .
" You had better order the carriage directly , my love ," said she ; " I dare say we shall be able to get along , if we set off directly ; and if we do come to any thing very bad , I can get out and walk .
or a mermaid ?
What would you advise me to do ?
Man ' s boasted power and freedom , all are flown .
" Ungrateful !-- What do you mean ?"
Every possibility of good was before me , and the first of blessings secured , in obtaining her promises of faith and correspondence .
Nothing , but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future .
At present , there was nothing to be done for Harriet ; good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible on Emma ' s side .
The clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall .
Perry tells me that Mr . Cole never touches malt liquor .
I should be as ready to acknowledge his merits as any other man ; but I hear of none , except what are merely personal ; that he is well - grown and good - looking , with smooth , plausible manners ."
-- But , in spite of these deficiencies , the wishes , the hopes , the confidence , the predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the ceremony , were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union .
" I shall never be invited to Abbey - Mill again ," was said in rather a sorrowful tone .
" That is ," replied Mr . Knightley , " she will indulge her even more than she did you , and believe that she does not indulge her at all .
On the subject of the first of the two circumstances , she did , after a little reflection , venture the following question .
But be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her -- quickness of friendship , or dulness of feeling -- there was one person , I think , who must have felt it : Miss Fairfax herself .
It was folly to be disturbed by it .
" None ; not one .
He is going to Kingston .
cried Emma , " this has been a most unfortunate -- most deplorable mistake !-- What is to be done ?"
The case is , you see , that the Campbells are going to Ireland .
" No ," said Mr . Knightley , nearly at the same time ; " you are not often deficient ; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension .
At the same time , I will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint , because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing before I am aware .
and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to me -- this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody -- though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the Campbells , may it not be from Mr . Knightley ?
The subject followed ; it was in plain , unaffected , gentlemanlike English , such as Mr . Knightley used even to the woman he was in love with , how to be able to ask her to marry him , without attacking the happiness of her father .
He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived more evil than good from them .
Emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure .
" It is certainly very well regulated ."
She had reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold , and it was desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of her other complaint before the gentleman ' s return .
There , it is done .
Weston .-- So it proved ;-- for when happily released from Mr . Elton , and seated by Mr . Weston , at dinner , he made use of the very first interval in the cares of hospitality , the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton , to say to her ,
my dear , we cannot begin too early ; you are not aware of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing ."
Will not it be beautiful in her dark hair ?"
We hear of him for ever at some watering - place or other .
repeated Mrs . Elton .
A man at his age -- what is he ?-- three or four - and - twenty -- cannot be without the means of doing as much as that .
The style of the letter was much above her expectation .
Perfectly remember Mrs . Perry ' s coming .-- Extraordinary dream , indeed !"
Emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love .
" Donwell !"
Emma was in no danger of forgetting .
Miss Smith , and Miss Bickerton , another parlour boarder at Mrs . Goddard ' s , who had been also at the ball , had walked out together , and taken a road , the Richmond road , which , though apparently public enough for safety , had led them into alarm .-- About half a mile beyond Highbury , making a sudden turn , and deeply shaded by elms on each side , it became for a considerable stretch very retired ; and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it , they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them , on a broader patch of greensward by the side , a party of gipsies .
If he had been anxious for secrecy , he would not have left the paper while I was by ; but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you .
said Emma , as soon as she could speak .
You are his object -- and you will soon receive the completest proof of it .
" How d ' ye do ?-- how d ' ye do ?-- Very well , I thank you .
She saw in a moment all the possible good .
.
They had been meeting almost every day since his arrival .
I consider one as including the other .
Mrs . Weston was acting no part , feigning no feelings in all that she said to him in favour of the event .-- She had been extremely surprized , never more so , than when Emma first opened the affair to her ; but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all , and had no scruple in urging him to the utmost .-- She had such a regard for Mr . Knightley , as to think he deserved even her dearest Emma ; and it was in every respect so proper , suitable , and unexceptionable a connexion , and in one respect , one point of the highest importance , so peculiarly eligible , so singularly fortunate , that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature , and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it , and wished it long ago .-- How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced their own home for Hartfield !
" You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match .
She was as happy as possible with the Martins in the summer .
I told you that I did not wonder at your attachment ; that considering the service he had rendered you , it was extremely natural :-- and you agreed to it , expressing yourself very warmly as to your sense of that service , and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward to your rescue .-- The impression of it is strong on my memory ."
The carriage was sent for them now .
" Aye , that ' s very just , indeed , that ' s very properly said .
" He will have every body ' s wishes for his happiness ."
cried Mr . Elton , " what can be the meaning of this ?-- Miss Smith !-- I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my existence -- never paid her any attentions , but as your friend : never cared whether she were dead or alive , but as your friend .
We have nothing clever to say -- not one of us .
" No , indeed you are mistaken ."
There is no admiration between them , I do assure you ; and the appearances which have caught you , have arisen from some peculiar circumstances -- feelings rather of a totally different nature -- it is impossible exactly to explain :-- there is a good deal of nonsense in it -- but the part which is capable of being communicated , which is sense , is , that they are as far from any attachment or admiration for one another , as any two beings in the world can be .
" What shall you do !
The word _home_ made his father look on him with fresh complacency .
But if she continued to play whenever she was asked by Mr . Dixon , one may guess what one chuses ."
I would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else ; but you need not be afraid , they are very small , you see -- one of our small eggs will not hurt you .
Emma was obliged to ask what they had told her , though fearful of its producing Mr . Elton .
Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody .
