" Such an eye !-- the true hazle eye -- and so brilliant !
He saw no fault in the room , he would acknowledge none which they suggested .
" I am ready , if the others are ."
She might assist his resolution , or reconcile him to it ; she might give just praise to Harriet , or , by representing to him his own independence , relieve him from that state of indecision , which must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his .-- They had reached the house .
Some portion of respect for herself , however , in spite of all these demerits -- some concern for her own appearance , and a strong sense of justice by Harriet --( there would be no need of _compassion_ to the girl who believed herself loved by Mr . Knightley -- but justice required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now ,) gave Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness , with even apparent kindness .-- For her own advantage indeed , it was fit that the utmost extent of Harriet ' s hopes should be enquired into ; and Harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained -- or to deserve to be slighted by the person , whose counsels had never led her right .-- Rousing from reflection , therefore , and subduing her emotion , she turned to Harriet again , and , in a more inviting accent , renewed the conversation ; for as to the subject which had first introduced it , the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax , that was quite sunk and lost .-- Neither of them thought but of Mr . Knightley and themselves .
Her heart had been long growing kinder towards Jane ; and this picture of her present sufferings acted as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion , and left her nothing but pity ; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of the past , obliged her to admit that Jane might very naturally resolve on seeing Mrs . Cole or any other steady friend , when she might not bear to see herself .
" Let me entreat you ," cried Mr . Elton ; " it would indeed be a delight !
But from one cause or another , I gave it up in disgust .
" Between Mr . Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax ?
" Robert Martin has no great loss -- if he can but think so ; and I hope it will not be long before he does .
He stopped in his earnestness to look the question , and the expression of his eyes overpowered her .
It was a melancholy change ; and Emma could not but sigh over it , and wish for impossible things , till her father awoke , and made it necessary to be cheerful .
A bride , you know , must appear like a bride , but my natural taste is all for simplicity ; a simple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery .
The horror of being blocked up at Randalls , while her children were at Hartfield , was full in her imagination ; and fancying the road to be now just passable for adventurous people , but in a state that admitted no delay , she was eager to have it settled , that her father and Emma should remain at Randalls , while she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them .
I met her frequently at Weymouth .
He had been going to call on them .
CHAPTER XI
" Here ," resumed Harriet , turning to her box again , " here is something still more valuable , I mean that _has_ _been_ more valuable , because this is what did really once belong to him , which the court - plaister never did ."
What strength , or what constancy of affection he might be subject to , was another point ; but at present she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration , a conscious preference of herself ; and this persuasion , joined to all the rest , made her think that she _must_ be a little in love with him , in spite of every previous determination against it .
He was a nervous man , easily depressed ; fond of every body that he was used to , and hating to part with them ; hating change of every kind .
I assure you I have no doubt of its doing Mr . Woodhouse good ."
She will probably have soon done , and then we shall go home .
" No , sir ," cried Emma , " it confesses no such thing .
" Poor child !"
And now to chuse the mortification of Mrs . Elton ' s notice and the penury of her conversation , rather than return to the superior companions who have always loved her with such real , generous affection ."
no doubt she had been suffering a great deal : more than any body had ever supposed -- and continual pain would try the temper .
So seldom that a letter , among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom , is even carried wrong -- and not one in a million , I suppose , actually lost !
The happiness of Miss Smith was quite equal to her intentions .
Miss Woodhouse , how ungrateful I have been !"
-- I remember that perfectly ."
The gentlemen spoke of his horse .
If the errand were not a pleasure to me , it could be done , as it always is when I am not here , by my grandmama ' s ."
" Increase !"
This topic was discussed very happily , and others succeeded of similar moment , and passed away with similar harmony ; but the evening did not close without a little return of agitation .
Jane often says , when she is here , ` I am sure , grandmama , you must have had very strong eyes to see as you do -- and so much fine work as you have done too !-- I only wish my eyes may last me as well .'"
I think Mr . John Knightley very far from looking well ."
Time , however , she thought , would tell him that they ought to be friends again .
And , my dear , whenever he comes , you had better let him look at little Bella ' s throat ."
You would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way , if you were married ."
" Now , ma ' am ," said Jane to her aunt , " shall we join Mrs .
" This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements , sir .
You are afraid of giving me trouble ; but I assure you , my dear Jane , the Campbells can hardly be more interested about you than I am .
" I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn , instead of coming here ."
There was a communication before her , one which _she_ only could be competent to make -- the confession of her engagement to her father ; but she would have nothing to do with it at present .-- She had resolved to defer the disclosure till Mrs . Weston were safe and well .
Elton .-- This letter tells us -- it is a short letter -- written in a hurry , merely to give us notice -- it tells us that they are all coming up to town directly , on Mrs . Churchill ' s account -- she has not been well the whole winter , and thinks Enscombe too cold for her -- so they are all to move southward without loss of time ."
" Oh !
It was rather too late in the day to set about being simple - minded and ignorant ; but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of being humble and discreet , and repressing imagination all the rest of her life .
Here ,-- probably this basket with pink ribbon .
Frank turned instantly to Emma , to claim her former promise ; and boasted himself an engaged man , which his father looked his most perfect approbation of -- and it then appeared that Mrs . Weston was wanting _him_ to dance with Mrs . Elton himself , and that their business was to help to persuade him into it , which was done pretty soon .-- Mr . Weston and Mrs . Elton led the way , Mr . Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed .
You and I must positively exert our authority ."
One man ' s style must not be the rule of another ' s .
I shall always have a great regard for the Miss Martins , especially Elizabeth , and should be very sorry to give them up , for they are quite as well educated as me .
I am always watching her to admire ; and I do pity her from my heart ."
" It is too small -- wants strength .
Emma listened with the warmest concern ; grieved for her more and more , and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful .
how so ?
I fancy I am rather a favourite ; he took notice of my gown .
And again , on Emma ' s merely turning her head to look at Mrs . Bates ' s knitting , she added , in a half whisper ,
Mrs . Weston , your argument weighs most with me .
" Oh !
Mr . Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled ; but the worst was overcome , the idea was given ; time and continual repetition must do the rest .-- To Emma ' s entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr . Knightley ' s , whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome ; and he was soon used to be talked to by each , on every fair occasion .-- They had all the assistance which Isabella could give , by letters of the strongest approbation ; and Mrs . Weston was ready , on the first meeting , to consider the subject in the most serviceable light -- first , as a settled , and , secondly , as a good one -- well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to Mr . Woodhouse ' s mind .-- It was agreed upon , as what was to be ; and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness ; and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it , he began to think that some time or other -- in another year or two , perhaps -- it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place .
Mr . Woodhouse was quite at ease ; and the seeing him so , with the arrival of the little boys and the philosophic composure of her brother on hearing his fate , removed the chief of even Emma ' s vexation .
It was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous as herself to avoid a meeting .
You do not know it I dare say , but two or three years ago I had a great passion for taking likenesses , and attempted several of my friends , and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general .
As he became rational , he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in their authority .
He came to the Abbey two evenings ago , on purpose to consult me about it .
A cold stormy rain set in , and nothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs , which the wind was despoiling , and the length of the day , which only made such cruel sights the longer visible .
And touching Miss Bates , who at that moment passed near --" Miss Bates , are you mad , to let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner ?
They were interrupted .
You will know it all in time .
Compare Mr . Martin with either of _them_ .
I have now a key to all her odd looks and ways .
It did her no service however .
" Robert Martin has no great loss -- if he can but think so ; and I hope it will not be long before he does .
The fact is , I suppose , that she is tired of Enscombe .
" And now we shall just miss them ; too provoking !-- I do not know when I have been so disappointed ."
I shall write to Mrs . Partridge in a day or two , and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look - out for any thing eligible ."
What do you advise ?"
" Ah !
Her cheeks flushed at the name , and she felt afraid of something , though she knew not what .
" It will not do ," whispered Frank to Emma ; " they are most of them affronted .
There was no time for farther remark or explanation .
It was very natural for you to say , what right has he to lecture me ?-- and I am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner .
Your neighbourhood is increasing , and you mix more with it .
It was the very circumstance he could have wished for .
The party was rather large , as it included one other family , a proper unobjectionable country family , whom the Coles had the advantage of naming among their acquaintance , and the male part of Mr . Cox ' s family , the lawyer of Highbury .
" Is not she ?
" That is the case with us all , papa .
" Why , pretty well ; but not quite well .
There was intimacy between them , and Mr . Cole had heard from Mr . Elton since his going away .
" Yes , all of us ; Mrs . Elton would have us come .
I like them extremely .
" I do not consider its length as particularly in its favour .
The carriage came : and Mr . Woodhouse , always the first object on such occasions , was carefully attended to his own by Mr . Knightley and Mr . Weston ; but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen , and the discovery of a much darker night than he had been prepared for .
I could not walk half so far ."
I did not immediately recollect .
She knows nothing herself , and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing .
I hope not of a putrid infectious sort .
But I am a partial old friend ."
She stopped to breathe .
