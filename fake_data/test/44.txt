" My poor dear Harriet !
" I am very much astonished , Mr . Elton .
Pray , pray attempt it .
" To fall in with each other on such an errand as this ," thought Emma ; " to meet in a charitable scheme ; this will bring a great increase of love on each side .
" She is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one ' s eyes from .
All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject , but I believed none of it .
In her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her .
There were not merely no grammatical errors , but as a composition it would not have disgraced a gentleman ; the language , though plain , was strong and unaffected , and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer .
This letter must make its way to Emma ' s feelings .
The wish of distinguishing her , as far as civility permitted , was very evident , though it could not often proceed beyond a look .
She spoke with a confidence which staggered , with a satisfaction which silenced , Mr . Knightley .
Emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject .
Chuse your own degree of crossness .
These kind of things are very well at Christmas , when one is sitting round the fire ; but quite out of place , in my opinion , when one is exploring about the country in summer .
" I cannot rate her beauty as you do ," said he ; " but she is a pretty little creature , and I am inclined to think very well of her disposition .
I do not say when , but perhaps you may guess where ;-- in the building in which N . takes M . for better , for worse ."
She proved to be the daughter of a tradesman , rich enough to afford her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers , and decent enough to have always wished for concealment .-- Such was the blood of gentility which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for !-- It was likely to be as untainted , perhaps , as the blood of many a gentleman : but what a connexion had she been preparing for Mr . Knightley -- or for the Churchills -- or even for Mr .
here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us ; thank you for the sight of it .
" Yes ," said his brother quickly , " it is Randalls that does it all ."
It is so with some men .
Mr . Elton knows you ."
Mr . Woodhouse was resigned .
" She always declares she will never marry , which , of course , means just nothing at all .
Emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face ; and while paying her own compliments to Mrs . Bates , and appearing to attend to the good old lady ' s replies , she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax , and return it into the purple and gold reticule by her side , saying , with significant nods ,
But " she could never get acquainted with her : she did not know how it was , but there was such coldness and reserve -- such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not -- and then , her aunt was such an eternal talker !-- and she was made such a fuss with by every body !-- and it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate -- because their ages were the same , every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other ."
Surprizes are foolish things .
She will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you , Miss Woodhouse , but your kindness will excuse her .
So peculiarly the lady in it .-- Just colour enough for beauty ."
" I do not find myself making any use of the word _sacrifice_ ," said she .-- " In not one of all my clever replies , my delicate negatives , is there any allusion to making a sacrifice .
Miss Woodhouse looks as if she did not want me .
" I am going to Kingston .
The room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied , and looking forwards ; behind it was another with which it immediately communicated ; the door between them was open , and Emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner .
They will be so very happy to see you ."
She bitterly regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her , and blushed for the envious feelings which had certainly been , in some measure , the cause .
He does not think of the draught .
But they live very comfortably .
She was the instigator .
The rest of the gentlemen being now in the room , Emma found herself obliged to turn from him for a few minutes , and listen to Mr . Cole .
" Oh !
While either of them protected him and his , Hartfield was safe .-- But Mr . John Knightley must be in London again by the end of the first week in November .
But Harriet rejected the suspicion with spirit .
It may be possible to do without dancing entirely .
I would not have Mr . Knightley know any thing about it for the world !
VOLUME I
" Then pray stay at Richmond ."
She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to - day , and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore throat herself .
What a letter the man writes !"
He saw a short word prepared for Emma , and given to her with a look sly and demure .
She had great pleasure in hearing Frank Churchill talked of ; and , for his sake , greater pleasure than ever in seeing Mr . and Mrs . Weston ; she was very often thinking of him , and quite impatient for a letter , that she might know how he was , how were his spirits , how was his aunt , and what was the chance of his coming to Randalls again this spring .
You might not see one in a hundred with _gentleman_ so plainly written as in Mr . Knightley .
And as to my poor word ` success ,' which you quarrel with , I do not know that I am so entirely without any claim to it .
" So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young -- he wondered he could not remember them !
It is impossible ."
The interest he takes in her -- his anxiety about her health -- his concern that she should have no happier prospect !
It ought to have been a habit with him by this time , of following his duty , instead of consulting expediency .
There is something so shocking in a child ' s being taken away from his parents and natural home !
It was almost enough to make her think of marrying .
" It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four - and - twenty should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount .
" Yes , to be sure , I suppose there are .
I can allow for the fears of the child , but not of the man .
" Mr . Knightley and Jane Fairfax !"
Emma ' s going away directly after tea might be giving offence .
He had his shepherd ' s son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her .
She wished he could love a ballroom better , and could like Frank Churchill better .-- He seemed often observing her .
I cannot help suspecting him .
" You had better go on ," said she .
It has been so many years my province to give advice , that you cannot be surprized , Mr . Knightley , at this little remains of office ."
He began -- stopping , however , almost directly to say , " Had I been offered the sight of one of this gentleman ' s letters to his mother - in - law a few months ago , Emma , it would not have been taken with such indifference ."
A superior performer !-- very far from it , I assure you .
He was gone the next moment :-- after another moment ' s pause ,
I have done very little ."
The picture !-- How eager he had been about the picture !-- and the charade !-- and an hundred other circumstances ;-- how clearly they had seemed to point at Harriet .
It was our darling wish that you might be attached to each other -- and we were persuaded that it was so .-- Imagine what we have been feeling on your account ."
" Oh , the difference of situation and habit !
Harriet said , " very true ," and she " would not think about it ;" but still she talked of it -- still she could talk of nothing else ; and Emma , at last , in order to put the Martins out of her head , was obliged to hurry on the news , which she had meant to give with so much tender caution ; hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry , ashamed or only amused , at such a state of mind in poor Harriet -- such a conclusion of Mr . Elton ' s importance with her !
" Yes -- I imagined -- that is -- I did not --"
Depend upon it , he will be much farther from doing _you_ justice .
Perfectly remember Mrs . Perry ' s coming .-- Extraordinary dream , indeed !"
" Dreadful !-- Exactly so , indeed .-- She will be missed every moment ."
She was then obliged to be finished , and make her appearance .
The public pays and must be served well ."
No additional agitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved -- and the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the appointed time .-- A fortnight , at least , of leisure and peace of mind , to crown every warmer , but more agitating , delight , should be hers .
He re - urged -- she re - declined ; and he seemed then about to make his bow , when taking the paper from the table , she returned it --
But this good old Mr . Woodhouse , I wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner .
His visit he would now defer ; but they had a very interesting parley about what could be done and should be done .
Harriet smiled again , and her smiles grew stronger .
When I am quite determined as to the time , I am not at all afraid of being long unemployed .
He had his shepherd ' s son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her .
He was to leave them early the next day ; and he soon began with --
She might do very well by herself .
They were going to take the two eldest boys to Astley ' s .
Here is my sketch of the fourth , who was a baby .
It was also a very early speculation with Emma .
He thought much of the evils of the journey for her , and not a little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some of the party the last half of the way ; but his alarms were needless ; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished , and Mr . and Mrs . John Knightley , their five children , and a competent number of nursery - maids , all reaching Hartfield in safety .
There was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner .
Mr . Knightley grew angry .
What right had he to endeavour to please , as he certainly did -- to distinguish any one young woman with persevering attention , as he certainly did -- while he really belonged to another ?-- How could he tell what mischief he might be doing ?-- How could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him ?-- very wrong , very wrong indeed ."
And , besides , I must give you a hint , Frank ; any want of attention to her _here_ should be carefully avoided .
[ Emma by Jane Austen 1816 ]
I like him very much .
