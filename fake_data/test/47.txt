I am sure you did not much expect to like us .
She questioned him as to the society in Yorkshire -- the extent of the neighbourhood about Enscombe , and the sort ; and could make out from his answers that , as far as Enscombe was concerned , there was very little going on , that their visitings were among a range of great families , none very near ; and that even when days were fixed , and invitations accepted , it was an even chance that Mrs . Churchill were not in health and spirits for going ; that they made a point of visiting no fresh person ; and that , though he had his separate engagements , it was not without difficulty , without considerable address _at_ _times_ , that he could get away , or introduce an acquaintance for a night .
She longed for the serenity they might gradually introduce ; and on Mr . Perry ' s coming in soon after dinner , with a disengaged hour to give her father , she lost no time ill hurrying into the shrubbery .-- There , with spirits freshened , and thoughts a little relieved , she had taken a few turns , when she saw Mr . Knightley passing through the garden door , and coming towards her .-- It was the first intimation of his being returned from London .
" And the next news , I suppose , will be , that we are to lose you -- just as I begin to know you ."
They all united ; and , on reaching Hartfield gates , Emma , who knew it was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father , pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him .
Their propriety , simplicity , and elegance , would make them the safest model for any young woman ."
And I see very few pearls in the room except mine .-- So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer , I understand .-- We shall see if our styles suit .-- A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill .
He was looking about , he was going to the door , he was watching for the sound of other carriages ,-- impatient to begin , or afraid of being always near her .
" Come , come ," cried Emma , feeling this to be an unsafe subject , " I must beg you not to talk of the sea .
How much worse , had they been obliged to meet !
In general he was judged , throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury , with great candour ; liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man -- one who smiled so often and bowed so well ; but there was one spirit among them not to be softened , from its power of censure , by bows or smiles -- Mr . Knightley .
How very odd !
Emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech , from his wife .
Every body must be aware that Miss Taylor must be missed , but every body ought also to be assured that Mr . and Mrs . Weston do really prevent our missing her by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated -- which is the exact truth ."
With a little reserve of manner , Emma continued :
Mr . Cole said how much taste you had ; and Mr . Frank Churchill talked a great deal about your taste , and that he valued taste much more than execution ."
said she , beginning again when they were all in the street .
" To fall in with each other on such an errand as this ," thought Emma ; " to meet in a charitable scheme ; this will bring a great increase of love on each side .
" Come ," said he , " you are anxious for a compliment , so I will tell you that you have improved her .
Poor little dears , how glad they will be to come .
he cried , " I wish your father might be half as easily convinced as John will be , of our having every right that equal worth can give , to be happy together .
said he , ` I can fasten the rivet .
And so excellent in the Church !
" Yes , and what you told me on that head , confirmed an idea which I had entertained before .-- I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either Mr . Dixon or Miss Fairfax , but I cannot help suspecting either that , after making his proposals to her friend , he had the misfortune to fall in love with _her_ , or that he became conscious of a little attachment on her side .
You need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment ."
I think he is just the person to do it , even without being in love ."
you were perfectly right !
cried Emma , " I know there is not a better creature in the world : but you must allow , that what is good and what is ridiculous are most unfortunately blended in her ."
Intimacy between Miss Fairfax and me is quite out of the question .
" Then , my dear Isabella , it is the most extraordinary sort of thing in the world , for in general every thing does give you cold .
" It is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion ," said Mr . Knightley .
It would be a great disappointment to Mr . John Knightley ; consequently to Isabella .
The ball proceeded pleasantly .
Emma remained in a state of vexation too ; but there was more indistinctness in the causes of her ' s , than in his .
Her father never went beyond the shrubbery , where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long walk , or his short , as the year varied ; and since Mrs . Weston ' s marriage her exercise had been too much confined .
No , Emma , your amiable young man can be amiable only in French , not in English .
They were permitted to go alone ; and with a cordial nod from one , and a graceful bow from the other , the two gentlemen took leave .
" I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr . Elton .
Oh !
He had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle ; his horror of late hours , and large dinner - parties , made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms .
Knightley is quite the gentleman .
The prospect before her now , was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled -- that might not be even partially brightened .
There he had not always the patience that could have been wished .
She had understood it was to be delayed till Colonel Campbell ' s return ."
" If not in our dispositions ," she presently added , with a look of true sensibility , " there is a likeness in our destiny ; the destiny which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own ."
She had an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man , for she hardly knew what indisposition was ; and if he did not invent illnesses for her , she could make no figure in a message .
What were nine miles to a young man ?-- An hour ' s ride .
The strength , resolution , and presence of mind of the Mr . Knightleys , commanded his fullest dependence .
Mrs . Weston looked up , afraid to believe ; but Emma ' s countenance was as steady as her words .
She had had three weeks of happy exemption from Mr . Elton ; and Harriet ' s mind , she had been willing to hope , had been lately gaining strength .
His face lengthened immediately ; and his voice was the voice of sentiment as he answered .
" Such an imagination has crossed me , I own , Emma ; and if it never occurred to you before , you may as well take it into consideration now ."
" Christmas weather ," observed Mr . Elton .
I had imagined him , I confess , a degree or two nearer gentility ."
If one could ascertain what the chief of them -- the Coles , for instance .
" You know what you are about ."
It is not in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of Knightley ."
He may spend the evening with his dear William Larkins now if he likes ."
" I am afraid we must be running away ," said Emma , glancing at Harriet , and beginning to rise --" My father will be expecting us .
If I had followed her judgment , and subdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper , I should have escaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever known .-- We quarrelled .-- Do you remember the morning spent at Donwell ?-- _There_ every little dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis .
Mrs . Elton , very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her by such a hope , smiled most graciously .
Frank Churchill ' s character was not desperate .-- She was his own Emma , by hand and word , when they returned into the house ; and if he could have thought of Frank Churchill then , he might have deemed him a very good sort of fellow .
It would be the greatest pleasure to them , if you could allow me to attend you there .
You will not like staying late .
Mrs . John Knightley was delighted to be of use ; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to her -- and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr . Wingfield , she was quite eager to have Harriet under her care .-- When it was thus settled on her sister ' s side , Emma proposed it to her friend , and found her very persuadable .-- Harriet was to go ; she was invited for at least a fortnight ; she was to be conveyed in Mr . Woodhouse ' s carriage .-- It was all arranged , it was all completed , and Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square .
Every body seemed happy ; and the praise of being a delightful ball , which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be , was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this .
Married women , you know , may be safely authorised .
You would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way , if you were married ."
Emma found that she must wait ; and now it required little effort .
Quite the queen of the evening !-- Well , here we are at the passage .
It was most unlikely , therefore , that he should ever want his father ' s assistance .
always my kindest friend on every occasion .
She restrained herself , however , from any of the reproofs she could have given , and only thanked Mrs . Elton coolly ; " but their going to Bath was quite out of the question ; and she was not perfectly convinced that the place might suit her better than her father ."
" You are comfortable because you are under command ."
Emma knew what was coming ; they must have the letter over again , and settle how long he had been gone , and how much he was engaged in company , and what a favourite he was wherever he went , and how full the Master of the Ceremonies ' ball had been ; and she went through it very well , with all the interest and all the commendation that could be requisite , and always putting forward to prevent Harriet ' s being obliged to say a word .
His father would not own himself uneasy , and laughed at her fears ; but she could not be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare .
Harriet , Harriet , do not deceive yourself ; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion .
Little Henry was in her thoughts , and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her irresolute what else to say .
" Yes , sometimes he can ."
And touching Miss Bates , who at that moment passed near --" Miss Bates , are you mad , to let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner ?
you amuse me excessively .
" Thank you , thank you .-- This is just what I wanted to be assured of .-- Oh !
She was quite one of her worthies -- the most amiable , affable , delightful woman -- just as accomplished and condescending as Mrs . Elton meant to be considered .
" Well -- but if any difficulties should arise , my housekeeper is extremely clever ."
She smiled her acceptance ; and nothing less than a summons from Richmond was to take him back before the following evening .
Dixon in them ."
Every distinguishing attention that could be paid , was paid to her .
He seemed not merely happy with her , but proud .
" I was just going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him arrive this morning .
We cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before .
Mr . Perry might have reason to regret the alteration , but nobody else could ."
Mr . Dixon , you say , is not , strictly speaking , handsome ?"
" I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls ."
There was a seriousness in Harriet ' s manner which prepared her , quite as much as her words , for something more than ordinary .
This is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings .
Miss Woodhouse was so great a personage in Highbury , that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure ; but the humble , grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings , delighted with the affability with which Miss Woodhouse had treated her all the evening , and actually shaken hands with her at last !
I am always well , you know .
" Ah !
Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could , with thorough self - approbation , recommend ; though he might constrain himself , while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things , to say :
I like her the better for it .
