Besides , she is out of health now ; but _that_ indeed , by her own account , she has always been .
Once , I felt the fire rather too much ; but then I moved back my chair a little , a very little , and it did not disturb me .
In all probability she was at this very time waited for there ; and Mr . Knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards Mr . Elton , if not towards William Larkins .
" Oh no !
She saw that Enscombe could not satisfy , and that Highbury , taken at its best , might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement at home than he liked .
The intermediate month was the one fixed on , as far as they dared , by Emma and Mr .
" Come ," said she , " I will tell you something , in return for what you have told me .
Mr . Weston , I dare say , has been telling you exactly how the matter stands ?"
She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt , very worthy people ; I have known them all my life .
I do not see it ."
had she never brought Harriet forward !
She was quite convinced of Mr . Elton ' s being in the fairest way of falling in love , if not in love already .
A very friendly shake of the hand , a very earnest " Good - bye ," closed the speech , and the door had soon shut out Frank Churchill .
As she sat one morning , looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day , a note was brought from Mrs . Goddard , requesting , in most respectful terms , to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her ; a most welcome request : for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen , whom Emma knew very well by sight , and had long felt an interest in , on account of her beauty .
It seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely serious , which she did not wish .
_She_ disapproved them , which ought to have been enough .-- My plea of concealing the truth she did not think sufficient .-- She was displeased ; I thought unreasonably so : I thought her , on a thousand occasions , unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious : I thought her even cold .
I am sure he was particularly silent when Mrs . Cole told us of it at dinner ."
Mr . Knightley , one moment more ; something of consequence -- so shocked !-- Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples !"
She had never seen Frank Churchill so silent and stupid .
At her age she can have no experience , and with her little wit , is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her .
" And now that I understand your question , I must pronounce it to be a very unfair one .
In respectability of character , there can be no doubt that they are .
I congratulate you , my dear Harriet , with all my heart .
That , from such a quarter , one might expect .
Oh !
His good friend Perry , too , whom he had spoken to on the subject , did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind ; but he had desired Perry to be upon the watch , and as he went about so much , something , he thought , might come from that quarter .
A hasty and imprudent attachment may arise -- but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards .
" The carriage !
My brother and sister will be enchanted with this place .
" Yes ; my father is to join me here : we shall walk back together , and I must be off immediately .
Isabella cannot bear to stay behind her husband ."
" He was afraid they should have a very bad drive .
She read the concluding lines , and was all flutter and happiness .
In half a minute they were in the room .
" But , my dear papa , you are no friend to matrimony ; and therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _bride_ ?
Jane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury , and was restored to the comforts of her beloved home with the Campbells .-- The Mr . Churchills were also in town ; and they were only waiting for November .
And I have no doubt that he _will_ thrive , and be a very rich man in time -- and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb _us_ ."
I would not have you too sanguine ; though , however it may end , be assured your raising your thoughts to _him_ , is a mark of good taste which I shall always know how to value ."
evil to some is always good to others .
Mrs . Elton was spoken of .
" I have not a fault to find with her person ," he replied .
There was one , however , which Emma thought something of .-- The two last dances before supper were begun , and Harriet had no partner ;-- the only young lady sitting down ;-- and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers , that how there could be any one disengaged was the wonder !-- But Emma ' s wonder lessened soon afterwards , on seeing Mr . Elton sauntering about .
said he quietly , and looking at her ; " of what nature ?"
You cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me !
she is absolutely charming !
" But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so soon , though he does .
" Oh , what a sweet house !-- How very beautiful !-- There are the yellow curtains that Miss Nash admires so much ."
He is but young , and his uncle , perhaps --"
I feel it so very due .
She was not yet dancing ; she was working her way up from the bottom , and had therefore leisure to look around , and by only turning her head a little she saw it all .
To Mr . John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the subject , for the first start of its possibility .
Now , as we may fairly suppose , he would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady , and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday , it is not unlikely that he should be at Mrs . Goddard ' s to - day ; and she may be detained by a visitor , without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch ."
How completely it meant , ` why should my picture be drawn ?'"
Nothing hastily done ; nothing incomplete .
Beyond it she would on no account proceed .
" She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs . Smallridge ' s children -- a dear friend of Mrs . Elton ' s -- a neighbour of Maple Grove ; and , by the bye , I wonder how Mrs . Elton bears the disappointment ?"
" Handsome !
" I shall not scold you .
She did not repent what she had done ; she still thought herself a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be ; but yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general , which made her dislike having it so loudly against her ; and to have him sitting just opposite to her in angry state , was very disagreeable .
Every body is lazy !
I am serious , Miss Woodhouse , whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy -- I am sick of England -- and would leave it to - morrow , if I could ."
" To be sure !"
You will not like the noise ."
" My first enjoyment ," replied John Knightley , as they passed through the sweep - gate , " will be to find myself safe at Hartfield again ."
I shall not discuss it here .
I dream of every body at Highbury when I am away -- and when I have gone through my particular friends , then I begin dreaming of Mr . and Mrs .
" Having understood as much , I was rather astonished to find her so very lady - like !
" Aye , do , Frank .-- Go and fetch Miss Bates , and let us end the matter at once .
She soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs . Elton ' s thoughts , and understand why she was , like herself , in happy spirits ; it was being in Miss Fairfax ' s confidence , and fancying herself acquainted with what was still a secret to other people .
Nothing wrong in him escaped her .
It will do you good to speak of your distress , whatever it may be ."
We have notice of it in a letter to - day .
It used to stand here .
She was wanting to see him again , and especially to see him in company with Mrs . Weston , upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him was to depend .
" Why will not you write one yourself for us , Mr .
Emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour .
" Well , I have so little confidence in my own judgment , that whenever I marry , I hope some body will chuse my wife for me .
Most comfortable carriage .-- Oh !
You may believe me , Mrs . Weston .
Come , and eat my strawberries .
Her character depends upon those she is with ; but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman ."
Mr . Weston , on his side , added a virtue to the account which must have some weight .
She had understood it was to be delayed till Colonel Campbell ' s return ."
The scene enlarged ; two persons appeared ; Mrs . Weston and her son - in - law ; they were walking into Highbury ;-- to Hartfield of course .
now you are looking very sly .
She had half a mind to resent ; but an instant ' s observation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings , and not meant to provoke ; and therefore she let it pass .
Mr . Elton returned , a very happy man .
It was a private resolution of hers , not communicated to him -- or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction .-- Till yesterday , I know he said he was in the dark as to her plans .
" You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs . Weston for my feelings ," said Emma ; " were you to guess her to be _eighteen_ , I should listen with pleasure ; but _she_ would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words .
" No , sir ," cried Emma , " it confesses no such thing .
A Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on that passage ."
His aunt could not bear to have him leave her .
All the better .
` Oh !'
She seemed to propose shewing no agitation , or disappointment , or peculiar concern in the discovery .
How is Mr .
As far as good intentions went , we were _both_ right , and I must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong .
She knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than she could perform with credit ; she wanted neither taste nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable , and could accompany her own voice well .
" Good God !"
Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell .
