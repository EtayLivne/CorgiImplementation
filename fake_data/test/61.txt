She was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from herself ."
Quite a humourist .
" But I have never fixed on June or any other month -- merely looked forward to the summer in general ."
Mrs . Weston , if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good I have done Miss Fairfax !-- Well ( checking herself , and trying to be more lively ), this is all to be forgotten .
She is pretty , and she is good tempered , and that is all .
Emma ' s courage returned , and she walked on .
The bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits ; and her being left in solitary grandeur , even supposing the omission to be intended as a compliment , was but poor comfort .
Gone to Mr . Woodhouse ' s .
A boyish scheme , indeed !-- I cannot comprehend a man ' s wishing to give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense with ; and he did know that she would have prevented the instrument ' s coming if she could ."
My dear Isabella , I have not heard you make one inquiry about Mr . Perry yet ; and he never forgets you ."
Though her nephew had had no particular reason to hasten back on her account , she had not lived above six - and - thirty hours after his return .
To her voluntary communications Emma could get no more approving reply , than ,
But here is my father coming : you will not object to my reading the charade to him .
He thought we walked towards Randalls most days .
" Never mind , Harriet , I shall not be a poor old maid ; and it is poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public !
It was almost enough to make her think of marrying .
said Emma playfully .
As a counsellor she was not wanted ; but as an approver , ( a much safer character ,) she was truly welcome .
She could never see a fault in any of them .
The Enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had been imagined , but he was at Highbury very soon afterwards .
Mrs . Elton had received notice of it that morning , and was in raptures .
" Your father will not be easy ; why do not you go ?"
If he had come at Christmas he could not have staid three days ; I was always glad he did not come at Christmas ; now we are going to have just the right weather for him , fine , dry , settled weather .
Interference -- fruitless interference .
Mr . Weston , do not mistake me .
Short had been the notice -- short their meeting ; he was gone ; and Emma felt so sorry to part , and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from his absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry , and feeling it too much .
You must take care of yourself , Mrs .
Two or three more of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them , and it was to be done in a quiet , unpretending , elegant way , infinitely superior to the bustle and preparation , the regular eating and drinking , and picnic parade of the Eltons and the Sucklings .
The fever was over , and Emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by injurious courtesy .
It might be a very indifferent piece of wit , but Emma found a great deal to laugh at and enjoy in it -- and so did Frank and Harriet .-- It did not seem to touch the rest of the party equally ; some looked very stupid about it , and Mr . Knightley gravely said ,
She has been so kind as to promise it .
A bride , you know , my dear , is always the first in company , let the others be who they may ."
She was the instigator .
" Me !"
It was known that they were a little acquainted ; but not a syllable of real information could Emma procure as to what he truly was .
They were entering the hall .
A note was written to urge it .
" Will you ?"
Miss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour ; and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself , or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect .
Her sensibilities , I suspect , are strong -- and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance , patience , self - controul ; but it wants openness .
I hope I have a better taste than to think of Mr . Frank Churchill , who is like nobody by his side .
Nothing to signify .
said Frank Churchill , as soon as they were out of hearing :--" How well they suit one another !-- Very lucky -- marrying as they did , upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place !-- They only knew each other , I think , a few weeks in Bath !
If I meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore , consider that point as settled ."
" Ah !
" Oh !
there I am -- thinking of him directly .
" I can never think of it without laughing .-- She hears us , she hears us , Miss Woodhouse .
Emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey ; and walking a few yards forward , while they talked together , soon made her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with Mr . Robert Martin .
If it was not for the drawback of her illness -- but I am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin , and looking very poorly .
She never had been so depressed .
Elton ?"
for the very moment Mr . Cole told Mrs . Cole of it , she sat down and wrote to me .
Before the middle of the next day , he was at Hartfield ; and he entered the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of the scheme .
But I do not like the corner into Vicarage Lane ."
And Frank Churchill was heard to say , " I think you could manage this without effort ; the first part is so very trifling .
said he , turning his eyes towards Jane .
Except the Sucklings and Bragges , there is not such another nursery establishment , so liberal and elegant , in all Mrs . Elton ' s acquaintance .
" Three o ' clock yesterday !
" I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him ."
I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith .
" Oh !"
No doubt it had been from jealousy .-- In Jane ' s eyes she had been a rival ; and well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed .
" Oh !
This must not be ."
" So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax ?"
" You , sir , may say any thing ," cried Mr . Elton , " but I must confess that I regard it as a most happy thought , the placing of Miss Smith out of doors ; and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit !
" You will soon be cooler , if you sit still ," said Emma .
Emma had not had time even to think of Mr . Elton , and she was so completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start , and a little blush , at the sound .
He may have as strong a sense of what would be right , as you can have , without being so equal , under particular circumstances , to act up to it ."
Voices approached the shop -- or rather one voice and two ladies : Mrs . Weston and Miss Bates met them at the door .
" Are you sure ?
I should like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the party ; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys .
A pleasant " thank you " seemed meant to laugh it off , but a blush , a quivering lip , a tear in the eye , shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh .
She made her plan ; she would speak of something totally different -- the children in Brunswick Square ; and she only waited for breath to begin , when Mr . Knightley startled her , by saying ,
" I shall never be easy till I have seen some of these places .
She admired him for contriving it , though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it was announced .
I always say , we are quite blessed in our neighbours .-- My dear sir , if there is one thing my mother loves better than another , it is pork -- a roast loin of pork --"
There is always some talent in it .
What was to be done ?
"` Smallridge !'
" I do not say it is so ; but you will do well to consider whether it is so or not , and to regulate your behaviour accordingly .
Now will be the time .
The happiness of this most happy day , received its completion , in the animated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced .
" If I can come again , we are still to have our ball .
You cannot be ignorant , Mrs . Elton , of my connexion with the family , nor of the treatment I have met with ; and , between ourselves , the whole blame of it is to be laid to her .
" Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would ."
At first , while I supposed you satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver , I saw it only as paternal kindness , and thought it the most natural thing in the world .
As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return , that was a mere joke ; he was afraid they would find no difficulty .
" I always told you she was -- a little ; but you will soon overcome all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome , all that has its foundation in diffidence .
actually resolve to break with him entirely !-- She felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each -- she dissolved it .-- What a view this gives of her sense of his behaviour !-- Well , he must be a most extraordinary --"
She ran away to indulge the inclination , leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to Harriet ' s share .
" It was certainly never brilliant , but she would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general ; and there was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face ."
This , Emma could not doubt , was all for herself .
" The sooner every party breaks up , the better ."
" I do think it is , without exception , the best charade I ever read ."
It confesses that you have long understood me ."
I remember one evening the poor boys saying , ` Uncle seems always tired now .'"
I have not the smallest doubt of the issue .
I dare say he will come in when he knows who is here .
