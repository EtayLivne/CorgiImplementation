` Oh !
" On the misery of what she had suffered , during the concealment of so many months ," continued Mrs . Weston , " she was energetic .
I feel that all the apologies should be on my side .
Mr . Knightley , I wish you had the benefit of this ; I think this would convince you .
You pass it over very handsomely -- but you were perfectly right ."
Exquisite , quite exquisite !-- Still , however , having proceeded so far , one is unwilling to give the matter up .
I would have her understand me .
He had a very fine flock , and , while she was with them , he had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country .
Will not it be a good plan ?
" Miss Fairfax was not well enough to write ;" and when Mr . Perry called at Hartfield , the same morning , it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited , though against her own consent , by himself , and that she was suffering under severe headaches , and a nervous fever to a degree , which made him doubt the possibility of her going to Mrs . Smallridge ' s at the time proposed .
Another song , however , was soon begged for .
Oh !
-- Highbury , with Mrs . Weston , stood for Hartfield ; and she trusted to its bearing the same construction with him .
I have a great regard for Mr . Perry .
This was all that was generally known of her history .
I hope it is a dry situation , and that her health will be taken good care of .
It is not that I am without the wish ; but you know how impossible my father would deem it that James should put - to for such a purpose ."
I do not want the match -- I do not want to injure dear little Henry -- but the idea has been given me by circumstances ; and if Mr . Knightley really wished to marry , you would not have him refrain on Henry ' s account , a boy of six years old , who knows nothing of the matter ?"
There was a little hesitation in Emma ' s answer .
Dr . Hughes I declare -- and Mrs . Hughes .
He was reckoned very handsome ; his person much admired in general , though not by her , there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense with :-- but the girl who could be gratified by a Robert Martin ' s riding about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by Mr . Elton ' s admiration .
His father had no apprehension of it .
Emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr . Martin ' s prose .
" I shall hear about you all ," said he ; " that is my chief consolation .
They must be separated ; but there was a great deal of pain in the process -- so much to herself at this time , that she soon felt the necessity of a little consolation , and resolved on going home by way of Randalls to procure it .
Their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her father .
" Well -- as you please ; only don ' t have a great set out .
" We will not allow her to do such a thing again :"-- and nodding significantly --" there must be some arrangement made , there must indeed .
She was told that now he wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them , almost as often as he could even wish .
I was glad you made her play so much , for having no instrument at her grandmother ' s , it must have been a real indulgence ."
" Yes , oh !
He seemed to have all the life and spirit , cheerful feelings , and social inclinations of his father , and nothing of the pride or reserve of Enscombe .
" She has had the advantage , you know , of practising on me ," she continued --" like La Baronne d ' Almane on La Comtesse d ' Ostalis , in Madame de Genlis ' Adelaide and Theodore , and we shall now see her own little Adelaide educated on a more perfect plan ."
The rich brother - in - law near Bristol was the pride of the alliance , and his place and his carriages were the pride of him .
-- repeated Frank Churchill , with a look of surprize and displeasure .-- " That is easy -- but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it , I suppose ."
We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe , and with Mrs . Churchill ' s temper , before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do .
Knightley .'
Mrs . Weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem .
" My dear Miss Woodhouse , a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act .
I bring a new proposal on the subject :-- a thought of my father ' s , which waits only your approbation to be acted upon .
Before the end of September , Emma attended Harriet to church , and saw her hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction , as no remembrances , even connected with Mr . Elton as he stood before them , could impair .-- Perhaps , indeed , at that time she scarcely saw Mr . Elton , but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on herself .-- Robert Martin and Harriet Smith , the latest couple engaged of the three , were the first to be married .
Their affection was always to subside into friendship .
" Upon my word it is , Miss Bates .-- He really is engaged from morning to night .-- There is no end of people ' s coming to him , on some pretence or other .-- The magistrates , and overseers , and churchwardens , are always wanting his opinion .
you amuse me excessively .
" I was very often influenced rightly by you -- oftener than I would own at the time .
Mr . Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser , and she knew Mr . Elton looked up to him .
yes , I am quite aware of that .
Indeed they are very delightful apples , and Mrs . Wallis does them full justice -- only we do not have them baked more than twice , and Mr . Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times -- but Miss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it .
And if poor little Anna Weston is to be spoiled , it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as you have done for me , except falling in love with her when she is thirteen ."
Knightley .'
He had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle ; his horror of late hours , and large dinner - parties , made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms .
She knows nothing herself , and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing .
His tall , firm , upright figure , among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men , was such as Emma felt must draw every body ' s eyes ; and , excepting her own partner , there was not one among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him .-- He moved a few steps nearer , and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner , with what natural grace , he must have danced , would he but take the trouble .-- Whenever she caught his eye , she forced him to smile ; but in general he was looking grave .
" Certainly .
Mr . Churchill , oh !
She would have been too happy but for poor Harriet ; but every blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend , who must now be even excluded from Hartfield .
" I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet , to be tempted ; Mr . Elton , you know , ( recollecting herself ,) is out of the question : and I do _not_ wish to see any such person .
" To think of your sending us all your store apples .
But you know what I am .-- You hear nothing but truth from me .-- I have blamed you , and lectured you , and you have borne it as no other woman in England would have borne it .-- Bear with the truths I would tell you now , dearest Emma , as well as you have borne with them .
But still she had inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully Mr . Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse danced -- for doing that in which she need not blush to compare herself with Jane Fairfax -- and even for simple dancing itself , without any of the wicked aids of vanity -- to assist him first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made to hold -- and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour , in the hope of discovering , in spite of all that Mr . Weston could say of their exactly equal size , that it was a little the largest .
" Leave out the two last lines , and there is no reason why you should not write it into your book ."
" Take a little time , consider , do not commit yourself ."
CHAPTER I
Such was his own account at Randall ' s .
It is not every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she did , and refuse to take Jane ' s answer ; but she positively declared she would _not_ write any such denial yesterday , as Jane wished her ; she would wait -- and , sure enough , yesterday evening it was all settled that Jane should go .
" You are not vain , Mr . Knightley .
Her face was averted from those who had made the attack , and turned towards her aunt .
Just as your drawings always are , my dear .
What has he been judging by ?-- I am not conscious of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this time for my marrying any more than at another .-- But it was so , I suppose .
united , ( _courtship_ , you know ,) what reverse we have !
she was not so easily to be talked out of it .
Am I to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss Smith ?-- that you have never thought seriously of her ?"
She made her plan ; she would speak of something totally different -- the children in Brunswick Square ; and she only waited for breath to begin , when Mr . Knightley startled her , by saying ,
Her mind was quite sick of Mr . Elton and the Martins .
If she were to meet Miss Bates in her way !-- and upon its beginning to rain , Emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be detaining her at Mrs . Goddard ' s , and that the intelligence would undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation .
She was sorry , but could not repent .
So obliged to you for the carriage last night .
For the present , he could not be spared , to his " very great mortification and regret ; but still he looked forward with the hope of coming to Randalls at no distant period ."
Natural enough !-- his own mind full of intrigue , that he should suspect it in others .-- Mystery ; Finesse -- how they pervert the understanding !
--
" No , not now , I thank you .
We were speaking the other day , you know , of his being so warm an admirer of her performance ."
Mrs . Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal of agitation herself ; and in the first place had wished not to go at all at present , to be allowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead , and to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed , and Mr . Churchill could be reconciled to the engagement ' s becoming known ; as , considering every thing , she thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports :-- but Mr . Weston had thought differently ; he was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her family , and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it ; or if it were , that it would be of any consequence ; for " such things ," he observed , " always got about ."
Neither would Mr . Knightley ' s downright , decided , commanding sort of manner , though it suits _him_ very well ; his figure , and look , and situation in life seem to allow it ; but if any young man were to set about copying him , he would not be sufferable .
However , as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine with them , and as you will both be there , and Mr . Knightley too , to take care of her , I cannot wish to prevent it , provided the weather be what it ought , neither damp , nor cold , nor windy ."
Knightley ?-- Who was so useful to him , who so ready to write his letters , who so glad to assist him ?-- Who so cheerful , so attentive , so attached to him ?-- Would not he like to have him always on the spot ?-- Yes .
Her intentions were unchanged .
" No , indeed I do not ."
Jane declined it , however , and the husband and wife walked off .
-- seemed to burst from an overcharged heart , and to describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her , even towards some of those who loved her best .
" _You_ probably have been less surprized than any of us , for you have had your suspicions .-- I have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution .-- I wish I had attended to it -- but --( with a sinking voice and a heavy sigh ) I seem to have been doomed to blindness ."
And a delightful dance it was to be .
Now , it would be really having Frank in their neighbourhood .
replied Miss Bates .
Sixteen miles -- nay , eighteen -- it must be full eighteen to Manchester - street -- was a serious obstacle .
" You are not quite so miserable , though , as when you first came .
I cannot see you acting wrong , without a remonstrance .
After a mutual silence of some minutes , Harriet thus began again --
" My dear sir , upon no account in the world ; my father can direct me ."
Go and eat and drink a little more , and you will do very well .
