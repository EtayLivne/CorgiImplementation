This was all sent with the instrument .
" You do quite right ," said she ;--" we will make your apologies to Mr . and Mrs .
Miss Woodhouse , I am quite concerned , I am sure you hit your foot .
One perplexity , however , arose , which the gentlemen did not disdain .
I have heard so much in praise of Mr . Frank Churchill .-- At the same time it is fair to observe , that I am one of those who always judge for themselves , and are by no means implicitly guided by others .
" Here have I ," said she , " actually talked poor Harriet into being very much attached to this man .
The listeners were amused ; and Mrs . Weston gave Emma a look of particular meaning .
I hope you do not retract what you then said ."
" I am not speaking of its prudence ; merely its probability ."
He got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor ' s merits , without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse ' s character , than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor ' s .
He was invited on good faith .
The " How d ' ye do ' s " were quiet and constrained on each side .
There was a little blush , and then this answer ,
Where is she ?-- Oh !
She must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction ."
I ' d rather you would ."
Mrs . Weston was looking so ill , and had an air of so much perturbation , that Emma ' s uneasiness increased ; and the moment they were alone , she eagerly said ,
she is a sweet creature !
She saw that Enscombe could not satisfy , and that Highbury , taken at its best , might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement at home than he liked .
High in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities , was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from Mr . Knightley would soon be over .
Emma was quite relieved , and could presently say , with a little more composure ,
In that case , nothing could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on .
I do not pretend to be a wit .
She watched him well .
The chances are that she must be a gainer ."
She is always so attentive to them !"
" As to the circumstances of her birth , though in a legal sense she may be called Nobody , it will not hold in common sense .
" You do quite right ," said she ;--" we will make your apologies to Mr . and Mrs .
She had given them neither men , nor names , nor places , that could raise a blush .
She thinks nobody equal to him ."
What right had he to endeavour to please , as he certainly did -- to distinguish any one young woman with persevering attention , as he certainly did -- while he really belonged to another ?-- How could he tell what mischief he might be doing ?-- How could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him ?-- very wrong , very wrong indeed ."
Though now the middle of December , there had yet been no weather to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise ; and on the morrow , Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family , who lived a little way out of Highbury .
Her next beginning was ,
He was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself , she just recovering from her mania for Mr . Elton .
Frank Churchill had behaved very ill by herself -- very ill in many ways ,-- but it was not so much _his_ behaviour as her _own_ , which made her so angry with him .
And then whispering -- " Our companions are excessively stupid .
I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point .
-- And in a louder , steadier tone , he concluded with , " He will soon be gone .
She could tell nothing of Hartfield , in which Mrs . Weston had not a lively concern ; and half an hour ' s uninterrupted communication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life depends , was one of the first gratifications of each .
Mrs . Weston said no more ; and Emma could imagine with what surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat .
She rose early , and wrote her letter to Harriet ; an employment which left her so very serious , so nearly sad , that Mr . Knightley , in walking up to Hartfield to breakfast , did not arrive at all too soon ; and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him , literally and figuratively , was quite necessary to reinstate her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before .
that I had never seen her !"
If _we_ set the example , many will follow it as far as they can ; though all have not our situations .
Her father -- and Harriet .
" His father ' s marriage ," he said , " had been the wisest measure , every friend must rejoice in it ; and the family from whom he had received such a blessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation on him ."
Things must come to a crisis soon now .
Man ' s boasted power and freedom , all are flown ; Lord of the earth and sea , he bends a slave , And woman , lovely woman , reigns alone .
Short had been the notice -- short their meeting ; he was gone ; and Emma felt so sorry to part , and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from his absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry , and feeling it too much .
Though I think he had better not have married .
Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr . Weston , and had half a mind to take it up ; but she struggled , and let it pass .
And Jane Fairfax , too , of all women !"
" Oh !
But I have no idea that she has yet ever seen a man she cared for .
She thought it was time to make up .
He left me not half an hour ago ."
" On your side , my love , it was very innocently done .
_What_ she was , must be uncertain ; but _who_ she was , might be found out ; and setting aside the 10 , 000 l ., it did not appear that she was at all Harriet ' s superior .
I never met with a disposition more truly amiable ."
Thank you , my mother is remarkably well .
" Excuse me ," said Jane earnestly , " I cannot by any means consent to such an arrangement , so needlessly troublesome to your servant .
A gentleman ' s family is all that I should condition for ."
" Poor Mrs . Churchill !
She restrained herself , however , from any of the reproofs she could have given , and only thanked Mrs . Elton coolly ; " but their going to Bath was quite out of the question ; and she was not perfectly convinced that the place might suit her better than her father ."
Had it taken place only once a year , it would have been a grievance .
-- but with many , many thanks --` there was no occasion to trouble us , for Mr . Knightley ' s carriage had brought , and was to take them home again .'
" Both sir !
We will not despair , however .
How completely it meant , ` why should my picture be drawn ?'"
He shook his head and laughed .--" I cannot separate Miss Fairfax and her complexion ."
I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly what every man delights in -- what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment .
She was , in fact , beginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing at all ; and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very disagreeable feelings , that , except in a moral light , as a penance , a lesson , a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind , she would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again .
The persons to be invited , required little thought .
you will never guess .
Miss Harriet Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast , though she is a very pretty girl .
repeated Mrs . Elton .
I don ' t say that it is not a disagreeable business -- but things might be much worse .-- If we walk fast , we shall soon be at Randalls ."
That nature had given it in feature could not be unseen by the young woman , nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents .
What was to be done ?
Emma accepted it with a very eager hand , with an impatience all alive to know what he would say about it , and not at all checked by hearing that her friend was unmentioned .
Gratifying , however , and stimulative as was the letter in the material part , its sentiments , she yet found , when it was folded up and returned to Mrs . Weston , that it had not added any lasting warmth , that she could still do without the writer , and that he must learn to do without her .
Mr . John Knightley was a tall , gentleman - like , and very clever man ; rising in his profession , domestic , and respectable in his private character ; but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally pleasing ; and capable of being sometimes out of humour .
He is just as superior as ever ;-- but being married , you know , it is quite a different thing .
" Just as they always do -- very vulgar ."
Emma smiled , and felt that Mr . Weston had very good reason for saying so .
An express arrived at Randalls to announce the death of Mrs . Churchill !
Such was Jane Fairfax ' s history .
It was quite a different sort of thing , a sentiment distinct and independent .
She and the children might stay very well ."
She said no more , other subjects took their turn ; and the rest of the dinner passed away ; the dessert succeeded , the children came in , and were talked to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation ; a few clever things said , a few downright silly , but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the other -- nothing worse than everyday remarks , dull repetitions , old news , and heavy jokes .
" Indeed !-- from Yorkshire , I think .
Such a very kind attention -- and so thoughtful an attention !-- the sort of thing that so few men would think of .
I could not give any connected detail yesterday ; but the suddenness , and , in one light , the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out , needs explanation ; for though the event of the 26th ult ., as you will conclude , immediately opened to me the happiest prospects , I should not have presumed on such early measures , but from the very particular circumstances , which left me not an hour to lose .
Part only of this answer , however , was admitted .
Pray make my excuses and adieus to her ."
.
But soon it came to be on one side ,
" It is one thing ," said she , presently -- her cheeks in a glow --" to have very good sense in a common way , like every body else , and if there is any thing to say , to sit down and write a letter , and say just what you must , in a short way ; and another , to write verses and charades like this ."
Now , however , it was absolutely to be ; every preparation was resumed , and very soon after the Churchills had removed to Richmond , a few lines from Frank , to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change , and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty - four hours at any given time , induced them to name as early a day as possible .
You know I candidly told you I should form my own opinion ; and I am happy to say that I am extremely pleased with him .-- You may believe me .
She must have been a perpetual enemy .
