Emma was extremely glad to see him -- but there was a degree of confusion -- a number of embarrassing recollections on each side .
" We cannot suppose that she has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage , my dear Emma -- but it is better than being always at home .
" Well ," said Mrs . Weston , smiling , " you give him credit for more simple , disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do ; for while Miss Bates was speaking , a suspicion darted into my head , and I have never been able to get it out again .
If she could not have been angry with Frank Churchill too , it would have been dreadful .-- As for Jane Fairfax , she might at least relieve her feelings from any present solicitude on her account .
" That is very likely .
" Excuse me , ma ' am , but this is by no means my intention ; I make no inquiry myself , and should be sorry to have any made by my friends .
Gilbert ."
" You were mentioning May .
John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection , and Isabella always thinks as he does ; except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children .
She could never see a fault in any of them .
It does relate to him , and I will tell you directly ;" ( resuming her work , and seeming resolved against looking up .)
And he is a very clever boy , indeed .
" Well , Mrs . Weston ," said Emma triumphantly when he left them , " what do you say now to Mr . Knightley ' s marrying Jane Fairfax ?"
They should take care of their health and their complexion .
` Oh !
" I wish we could contrive it ," said she ; " but I cannot think of any tolerable pretence for going in ;-- no servant that I want to inquire about of his housekeeper -- no message from my father ."
said Mr . Woodhouse , always the last to make his way in conversation ; " then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady .
Ford .-- " Yes -- no -- yes , to Mrs . Goddard ' s .
She had not been able to speak ; and , on entering the carriage , sunk back for a moment overcome -- then reproaching herself for having taken no leave , making no acknowledgment , parting in apparent sullenness , she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference ; but it was just too late .
" Well , go on ."
" And you must be off this very morning ?"
Well , I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland ."
Mr . Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe , which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command , as well as the route and the method of his journey ; and she listened , and smiled , and congratulated .
" You are right .
May I hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball , to be given , not at Randalls , but at the Crown Inn ?"
The rest of the day , the following night , were hardly enough for her thoughts .-- She was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had rushed on her within the last few hours .
Your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name your own terms , have as many rooms as you like , and mix in the family as much as you chose ;-- that is -- I do not know -- if you knew the harp , you might do all that , I am very sure ; but you sing as well as play ;-- yes , I really believe you might , even without the harp , stipulate for what you chose ;-- and you must and shall be delightfully , honourably and comfortably settled before the Campbells or I have any rest ."
I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall make this rivet quite firm .
" Upon my word it is , Miss Bates .-- He really is engaged from morning to night .-- There is no end of people ' s coming to him , on some pretence or other .-- The magistrates , and overseers , and churchwardens , are always wanting his opinion .
Without knowing when the carriage turned into Vicarage Lane , or when it stopped , they found themselves , all at once , at the door of his house ; and he was out before another syllable passed .-- Emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good night .
You must have done well .
Oh !
That is too young to settle .
Your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely .
Emma was gratified , and would soon have shewn no want of words , if the sound of Mrs . Elton ' s voice from the sitting - room had not checked her , and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her congratulatory sensations into a very , very earnest shake of the hand .
That was well done of me ; but there I should have stopped , and left the rest to time and chance .
Mrs . Weston remained with Mr . Woodhouse .
And I will own to you , ( I am sure it will be safe ), that so far as our living with Mr . Churchill at Enscombe , it is settled .
He caught her ."
These feelings rapidly restored his comfort , while Mrs . Weston , of a more apprehensive disposition , foresaw nothing but a repetition of excuses and delays ; and after all her concern for what her husband was to suffer , suffered a great deal more herself .
" And I do envy him , Emma .
There are places in town , offices , where inquiry would soon produce something -- Offices for the sale -- not quite of human flesh -- but of human intellect ."
That , you know , was so very .
Miss Woodhouse , how you do forget !"
And it is so cheerful a place , that it could not fail of being of use to Mr . Woodhouse ' s spirits , which , I understand , are sometimes much depressed .
A very friendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax , she hoped , might lead the way to a return of old feelings .
" I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill .-- I can suppose , however , that I may have underrated him .
This will be complete enjoyment ; and I do not know , Mrs . Elton , whether the uncertainty of our meetings , the sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to - day or to - morrow , and at any hour , may not be more friendly to happiness than having him actually in the house .
Miss Woodhouse !
And it is no small credit , in my opinion , to him , that he should excite such an affection ; for , though I would not say it to any body else , she has no more heart than a stone to people in general ; and the devil of a temper ."
" That is to say , you chose to have your walk , for you were not six yards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you ; and Henry and John had seen more drops than they could count long before .
I am only afraid of your sitting up for me .
Bought at Weymouth , you know -- Mr . Dixon ' s choice .
" No , sir ," cried Emma , " it confesses no such thing .
" You could not have visited me !"
replied he .
Mr . Elton is good - humoured , cheerful , obliging , and gentle .
How do you do ?-- Very well , I thank you .
These feelings rapidly restored his comfort , while Mrs . Weston , of a more apprehensive disposition , foresaw nothing but a repetition of excuses and delays ; and after all her concern for what her husband was to suffer , suffered a great deal more herself .
Mr . Weston had been so very earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves , for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came , that she could not refuse him , and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man ' s company .
I have spent so many happy months there !
You do not know what it is to have tempers to manage ."
I wish you may not catch cold ."
Emma listened , and looked , and soon perceived that Frank Churchill ' s state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of humour .
The ladies knew better how to allay it .
.
" Never , madam ," cried he , affronted in his turn : " never , I assure you .
She is very timid and silent .
I never knew days fly so fast .
Her sensibilities , I suspect , are strong -- and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance , patience , self - controul ; but it wants openness .
To him who has , it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence , and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought .
Both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again ; and after a few minutes silence , he said ,
Elton ."
She had always wanted to do every thing , and had made more progress both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to .
yes , gloves and every thing .
I did not immediately recollect .
I am exceedingly obliged to you , Mrs . Elton , I am obliged to any body who feels for me , but I am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer .
His ostensible reason , however , was to ask whether Mr . Woodhouse ' s party could be made up in the evening without him , or whether he should be in the smallest degree necessary at Hartfield .
But neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once , and Emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time .
She might assist his resolution , or reconcile him to it ; she might give just praise to Harriet , or , by representing to him his own independence , relieve him from that state of indecision , which must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his .-- They had reached the house .
I can never bear to think of you all there without me ."
Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates to join us ?"
" No , not Mr . Knightley ; he declined it from the first ; and though I thought he would come , because Mrs . Elton declared she would not let him off , he did not ;-- but my mother , and Jane , and I , were all there , and a very agreeable evening we had .
Mrs . Churchill was unwell -- far too unwell to do without him ; she had been in a very suffering state ( so said her husband ) when writing to her nephew two days before , though from her usual unwillingness to give pain , and constant habit of never thinking of herself , she had not mentioned it ; but now she was too ill to trifle , and must entreat him to set off for Enscombe without delay .
" Whatever you say is always right ," cried Harriet , " and therefore I suppose , and believe , and hope it must be so ; but otherwise I could not have imagined it .
Such an immense plantation all round it !
It was kindly said , and very far from giving offence .
You are so kind !"
no , it is a meeting at the Crown , a regular meeting .
Oh !
Jane and I quite ready .
Mrs . Perry was always particularly fond of my mother -- indeed I do not know who is not -- and she had mentioned it to her in confidence ; she had no objection to her telling us , of course , but it was not to go beyond : and , from that day to this , I never mentioned it to a soul that I know of .
To Mr . John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the subject , for the first start of its possibility .
he cried .
She was pondering , in the meanwhile , upon the possibility , without seeming very rude , of making her escape from Jane Fairfax ' s letter , and had almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse , when Miss Bates turned to her again and seized her attention .
" You are very obliging .-- Frank will be extremely happy , I am sure .-- He is to be in town next week , if not sooner .
Oh !
You do not mean it ?"
Do you know any family of that name ?"
For some weeks past she had been spending more than half her time there , and gradually getting to have a bed - room appropriated to herself ; and Emma judged it best in every respect , safest and kindest , to keep her with them as much as possible just at present .
