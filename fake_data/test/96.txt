How improperly had she been acting by Harriet !
I always say a woman cannot have too many resources -- and I feel very thankful that I have so many myself as to be quite independent of society ."
Miss Woodhouse , why are you always so right ?"
A degree or two lower , and a creditable appearance might interest me ; I might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other .
I should wish it ."
" Then pray stay at Richmond ."
She was nobody when he married her , barely the daughter of a gentleman ; but ever since her being turned into a Churchill she has out - Churchill ' d them all in high and mighty claims : but in herself , I assure you , she is an upstart ."
What totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house from what she had brought out !-- she had then been only daring to hope for a little respite of suffering ;-- she was now in an exquisite flutter of happiness , and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away .
" Your command ?-- Yes ."
Mr . Knightley , a sensible man about seven or eight - and - thirty , was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family , but particularly connected with it , as the elder brother of Isabella ' s husband .
She will be disagreeable in infancy , and correct herself as she grows older .
Shortly afterwards Miss Bates , passing near the window , descried Mr . Knightley on horse - back not far off .
Ford ."
" I have not been working uninterruptedly ," he replied , " I have been assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily , it was not quite firm ; an unevenness in the floor , I believe .
Mrs . Weston had been speaking to her at the same moment .
You seem shut out from every thing -- in the most complete retirement .-- And Mrs . Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion .
" My dear , you are too particular ," said her husband .
Mr . and Mrs . John Knightley , from having been longer than usual absent from Surry , were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest .
" Very true ," he gravely replied ; " it was very bad ."
I think him a very handsome young man , and his manners are precisely what I like and approve -- so truly the gentleman , without the least conceit or puppyism .
There was only Harriet , who seemed not in spirits herself , fagged , and very willing to be silent ; and Emma felt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home , without being at any trouble to check them , extraordinary as they were .
" Very soon , very soon , indeed ; that ' s the worst of it .
" Some very fine morning , he , and Emma , and Harriet , could go very well ; and he could sit still with Mrs . Weston , while the dear girls walked about the gardens .
" Such sweet lines !"
" Then pray stay at Richmond ."
" I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between them -- certain expressive looks , which I did not believe meant to be public ."
Yes , I am sure you are much too reasonable .
" Perry !"
He paused -- and growing cooler in a moment , added , with only sarcastic dryness , " If Mr . Perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty , I should be as willing to prefer Cromer to South End as he could himself ."
" What felicity it is to hear a tune again which _has_ made one happy !-- If I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth ."
" If it were admissible to contradict a lady ," said the gallant Mr . Elton --
" I am concerned to hear of it .
Mr . Knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort !-- No longer walking in at all hours , as if ever willing to change his own home for their ' s !-- How was it to be endured ?
I am all amazement !
" You may well class the delight , the honour , and the comfort of such a situation together ," said Jane , " they are pretty sure to be equal ; however , I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me .
Emma and Harriet had been walking together one morning , and , in Emma ' s opinion , had been talking enough of Mr . Elton for that day .
I was sure it could not be far off ; but I had put my huswife upon it , you see , without being aware , and so it was quite hid , but I had it in my hand so very lately that I was almost sure it must be on the table .
" My dear papa , I sent the whole hind - quarter .
Their love of society , and their new dining - room , prepared every body for their keeping dinner - company ; and a few parties , chiefly among the single men , had already taken place .
She was then interrupted by Harriet ' s coming in ; and if Harriet ' s praise could have satisfied her , she might soon have been comforted .
Oh no ; we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart , and were sure of meeting every day ."
What is to become of that ?-- Very true .
Though her nephew had had no particular reason to hasten back on her account , she had not lived above six - and - thirty hours after his return .
It will be felt so great an attention !
" Nonsense !
Aye , I remember it all now ; all , except your saving this relic -- I knew nothing of that till this moment -- but the cutting the finger , and my recommending court - plaister , and saying I had none about me !-- Oh !
Weston , tell me at once .-- Something has happened in Brunswick Square .
Emma watched the entree of her own particular little friend ; and if she could not exult in her dignity and grace , she could not only love the blooming sweetness and the artless manner , but could most heartily rejoice in that light , cheerful , unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many alleviations of pleasure , in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection .
no -- none in the least .
In the daily interchange of news , they must be again restricted to the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings ' coming had been united , such as the last accounts of Mrs . Churchill , whose health seemed every day to supply a different report , and the situation of Mrs . Weston , whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child , as that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it .
go to - day , go to - day .
" What a comfort it is , that we think alike about our nephews and nieces .
Have you finished it ?
I did not know what to do .
This does not apply , however , to Miss Bates ; she is only too good natured and too silly to suit me ; but , in general , she is very much to the taste of every body , though single and though poor .
I would not have you too sanguine ; though , however it may end , be assured your raising your thoughts to _him_ , is a mark of good taste which I shall always know how to value ."
She would be placed in the midst of those who loved her , and who had better sense than herself ; retired enough for safety , and occupied enough for cheerfulness .
" Your gallantry is really unanswerable .
They were permitted to go alone ; and with a cordial nod from one , and a graceful bow from the other , the two gentlemen took leave .
A fine place , but very retired ."
She did most heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhood -- and sat down and practised vigorously an hour and a half .
" I am very glad I did think of her .
You will express yourself very properly , I am sure .
Weston , tell me at once .-- Something has happened in Brunswick Square .
And when one considers the variety of hands , and of bad hands too , that are to be deciphered , it increases the wonder ."
She was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy wife together , without feeling uncomfortable .
Nature gave you understanding :-- Miss Taylor gave you principles .
cried Mr .
" Mrs . Gilbert does not mean to dance , but there is a young lady disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing -- Miss Smith ."
said she , as they proceeded -- speaking more to assist Mr . Weston in keeping his secret , than with any other view .
" Quite seasonable ; and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin yesterday , and prevent this day ' s party , which it might very possibly have done , for Mr . Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been much snow on the ground ; but now it is of no consequence .
CHAPTER XIV
He will be a completely gross , vulgar farmer , totally inattentive to appearances , and thinking of nothing but profit and loss ."
Upon her speaking her wonder aloud on that part of the subject , before the few who knew her opinion of Mrs . Elton , Mrs . Weston ventured this apology for Jane .
It was not in compliment to Jane Fairfax however that he was so indifferent , or so indignant ; he was not guided by _her_ feelings in reprobating the ball , for _she_ enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree .
I will take it home with me at night ."
He had reached Randalls the evening before .
But we never did .
and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to me -- this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody -- though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the Campbells , may it not be from Mr . Knightley ?
He is as well acquainted with his own claims , as you can be with Harriet ' s .
" What is the matter , sir ?-- Did you speak to me ?"
A man at his age -- what is he ?-- three or four - and - twenty -- cannot be without the means of doing as much as that .
This is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings .
You will not be sorry to find yourself at home ."
The looking over his letter again , in replying to it , had such a softening tendency , that it was particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions ; and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy , and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say , and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful , that Emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment , he would have been accepted after all .
said Mr . Woodhouse , shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her with tender concern .-- The ejaculation in Emma ' s ear expressed , " Ah !
.
I could very ill be spared -- but such a point had been made of my coming !
The very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it ; but he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior .
The strength of the song falls on the second ."
" I assure you she did .
I was glad you made her play so much , for having no instrument at her grandmother ' s , it must have been a real indulgence ."
There will be enough for every hope and every fear ; and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent , it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder .
He never wished to attach me .
I shall do something to expose myself ."
" I shall be very glad to look it over ," said he ; " but it seems long .
Woodhouse , who had already taken his little round in the highest part of the gardens , where no damps from the river were imagined even by him , stirred no more ; and his daughter resolved to remain with him , that Mrs . Weston might be persuaded away by her husband to the exercise and variety which her spirits seemed to need .
" No , I fancy not ," replied Mrs . Elton , with a most satisfied smile ."
Whether it was his own idea you know , one cannot tell .
He is the very best young man -- But , my dear Jane , if you remember , I told you yesterday he was precisely the height of Mr . Perry .
