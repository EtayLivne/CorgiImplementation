Can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations ?
" I dare say your apologies were accepted , sir .
His civilities to the other ladies must be paid ; but his subsequent object was to lament over himself for the heat he was suffering , and the walk he had had for nothing .
Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech , and saw no alarming symptoms of love .
I do not want to say more than is necessary -- I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done , and I dare say you understand me ."
aye , I know your scruples .
" Pray , Mr . Knightley ," said Emma , who had been smiling to herself through a great part of this speech , " how do you know that Mr . Martin did not speak yesterday ?"
Here are seven of you , besides myself , ( who , she is pleased to say , am very entertaining already ,) and she only demands from each of you either one thing very clever , be it prose or verse , original or repeated -- or two things moderately clever -- or three things very dull indeed , and she engages to laugh heartily at them all ."
Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr . Elton ' s having dropt a hint .
What strength , or what constancy of affection he might be subject to , was another point ; but at present she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration , a conscious preference of herself ; and this persuasion , joined to all the rest , made her think that she _must_ be a little in love with him , in spite of every previous determination against it .
He called for a few moments , just to leave a piece of paper on the table containing , as he said , a charade , which a friend of his had addressed to a young lady , the object of his admiration , but which , from his manner , Emma was immediately convinced must be his own .
" Depend upon it , Emma , a sensible man would find no difficulty in it .
The compliments of his neighbours were over ; he was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event ; and the wedding - cake , which had been a great distress to him , was all eat up .
Miss Nash has put down all the texts he has ever preached from since he came to Highbury .
Little Emma , grow up a better woman than your aunt .
There is nobody in Highbury who deserves him -- and he has been here a whole year , and has fitted up his house so comfortably , that it would be a shame to have him single any longer -- and I thought when he was joining their hands to - day , he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same kind office done for him !
Though she did not feel the first intelligence as she might have done the day before , or an hour before , its interest soon increased ; and before their first conversation was over , she had talked herself into all the sensations of curiosity , wonder and regret , pain and pleasure , as to this fortunate Miss Hawkins , which could conduce to place the Martins under proper subordination in her fancy .
Mrs . Weston , your argument weighs most with me .
I am serious , Miss Woodhouse , whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy -- I am sick of England -- and would leave it to - morrow , if I could ."
It was most unlikely , therefore , that he should ever want his father ' s assistance .
asked Mrs .
She was short , plump , and fair , with a fine bloom , blue eyes , light hair , regular features , and a look of great sweetness , and , before the end of the evening , Emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person , and quite determined to continue the acquaintance .
It was on the wedding - day of this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance .
" So very kind !"
" Ah !
He was not exactly what she had expected ; less of the man of the world in some of his notions , less of the spoiled child of fortune , therefore better than she had expected .
I will take it home with me at night ."
thought Emma .
It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his schemes ; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth , it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase Randalls , and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to ; but he had gone steadily on , with these objects in view , till they were accomplished .
Going in dismal weather , to return probably in worse ;-- four horses and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle , shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had at home ."
" You talk a great deal of the length of this passage , my dear .
But take it away , and all _appropriation_ ceases , and a very pretty gallant charade remains , fit for any collection .
Mr . Weston is really as kind as herself .
Her ignorance is hourly flattery .
CHAPTER IV
Gratifying , however , and stimulative as was the letter in the material part , its sentiments , she yet found , when it was folded up and returned to Mrs . Weston , that it had not added any lasting warmth , that she could still do without the writer , and that he must learn to do without her .
Mrs . Elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly .
` Oh !
Mr . Knightley had spoken prophetically , when he once said , " Emma , you have been no friend to Harriet Smith ."
Absolutely insufferable !
" To a Mrs . Smallridge -- charming woman -- most superior -- to have the charge of her three little girls -- delightful children .
The others had been talking of the child , Mrs . Weston giving an account of a little alarm she had been under , the evening before , from the infant ' s appearing not quite well .
I was ready to have gone with her , but this will do just as well .
She has a fault .
I speak as a friend , Emma .
These were pleasant feelings , and she walked about and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did , and collect round the strawberry - beds .-- The whole party were assembled , excepting Frank Churchill , who was expected every moment from Richmond ; and Mrs . Elton , in all her apparatus of happiness , her large bonnet and her basket , was very ready to lead the way in gathering , accepting , or talking -- strawberries , and only strawberries , could now be thought or spoken of .--" The best fruit in England -- every body ' s favourite -- always wholesome .-- These the finest beds and finest sorts .-- Delightful to gather for one ' s self -- the only way of really enjoying them .-- Morning decidedly the best time -- never tired -- every sort good -- hautboy infinitely superior -- no comparison -- the others hardly eatable -- hautboys very scarce -- Chili preferred -- white wood finest flavour of all -- price of strawberries in London -- abundance about Bristol -- Maple Grove -- cultivation -- beds when to be renewed -- gardeners thinking exactly different -- no general rule -- gardeners never to be put out of their way -- delicious fruit -- only too rich to be eaten much of -- inferior to cherries -- currants more refreshing -- only objection to gathering strawberries the stooping -- glaring sun -- tired to death -- could bear it no longer -- must go and sit in the shade ."
They all united ; and , on reaching Hartfield gates , Emma , who knew it was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father , pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him .
How little did I think !-- The two Abbots and I ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by , and Miss Nash came and scolded us away , and staid to look through herself ; however , she called me back presently , and let me look too , which was very good - natured .
He had , by that time , realised an easy competence -- enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining Highbury , which he had always longed for -- enough to marry a woman as portionless even as Miss Taylor , and to live according to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition .
The spring I always think requires more than common care .
She was ready to tell every thing in her power , but on this subject questions were vain .
An arch look expressed --" I understand you well enough ;" but she said only , " Miss Fairfax is reserved ."
Mr . Woodhouse would have been miserable had his daughter attempted it , and she was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas .
Could she be secure of that , indeed , of his never marrying at all , she believed she should be perfectly satisfied .-- Let him but continue the same Mr . Knightley to her and her father , the same Mr . Knightley to all the world ; let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of their precious intercourse of friendship and confidence , and her peace would be fully secured .-- Marriage , in fact , would not do for her .
" Whatever you say is always right ," cried Harriet , " and therefore I suppose , and believe , and hope it must be so ; but otherwise I could not have imagined it .
A piece of paper was found on the table this morning --( dropt , we suppose , by a fairy )-- containing a very pretty charade , and we have just copied it in ."
My dear Mrs . Weston , do not take to match - making .
The case , you see , is --( but this is quite between ourselves : I did not mention a syllable of it in the other room .
CHAPTER V
" I do not know whether it ought to be so , but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way .
Of the lady , individually , Emma thought very little .
.
With regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland , her account to her aunt contained nothing but truth , though there might be some truths not told .
Miss Smith , the step at the turning ."
She did not always feel so absolutely satisfied with herself , so entirely convinced that her opinions were right and her adversary ' s wrong , as Mr . Knightley .
" Well !
Thank ye , the gloves do very well -- only a little too large about the wrist ; but Jane is taking them in ."
I have no faith in Mrs . Elton ' s acknowledging herself the inferior in thought , word , or deed ; or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good - breeding .
And , after proceeding a few steps , she added -- " I stopped you ungraciously , just now , Mr . Knightley , and , I am afraid , gave you pain .-- But if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend , or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation -- as a friend , indeed , you may command me .-- I will hear whatever you like .
She was sorry , but could not repent .
It was all read , however , steadily , attentively , and without the smallest remark ; and , excepting one momentary glance at her , instantly withdrawn , in the fear of giving pain -- no remembrance of Box Hill seemed to exist .
Referring the education to her seemed to imply it .
said she : " did you ever sit for your picture ?"
" I do not know why you should say so .
The more I think of it , the more probable it appears .
By that time , it was beginning to hold up , and I was determined that nothing should stop me from getting away -- and then -- only think !-- I found he was coming up towards me too -- slowly you know , and as if he did not quite know what to do ; and so he came and spoke , and I answered -- and I stood for a minute , feeling dreadfully , you know , one can ' t tell how ; and then I took courage , and said it did not rain , and I must go ; and so off I set ; and I had not got three yards from the door , when he came after me , only to say , if I was going to Hartfield , he thought I had much better go round by Mr . Cole ' s stables , for I should find the near way quite floated by this rain .
Mrs . Elton eagerly interposed with ,
We always say what we like to one another ."
Harriet was very ready to speak of the share he had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening games ; and dwelt a good deal upon his being so very good - humoured and obliging .
It is the very last thing I would stand the brunt of just now .
But he laughed so heartily at the recollection , that Emma could not help saying ,
He had time only to say ,
Those soft blue eyes , and all those natural graces , should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its connexions .
I am really tired of exploring so long on one spot .
You may be very sure I shall always take care of _them_ ."
I am sure she will be here presently ."
Harriet , who had been standing in no unhappy reverie , was yet very glad to be called from it , by the now encouraging manner of such a judge , and such a friend as Miss Woodhouse , and only wanted invitation , to give the history of her hopes with great , though trembling delight .-- Emma ' s tremblings as she asked , and as she listened , were better concealed than Harriet ' s , but they were not less .
He had been at the pains of consulting Mr . Perry , the apothecary , on the subject .
If we feel for the wretched , enough to do all we can for them , the rest is empty sympathy , only distressing to ourselves ."
Emma was quite at a loss .
said Mrs . Weston in a trembling voice .
He had turned away , and the horses were in motion .
So much the better .
Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be expected ; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits , which appeared perfectly natural , as there was a dentist to be consulted ; but , since that business had been over , she did not appear to find Harriet different from what she had known her before .-- Isabella , to be sure , was no very quick observer ; yet if Harriet had not been equal to playing with the children , it would not have escaped her .
But you , who have known Miss Fairfax from a child , must be a better judge of her character , and of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations , than I can be ."
Undoubtedly if you wish it , I will endeavour to persuade them both ."
He did so , but very soon stopt again to say , " the pianoforte !
" As you do us such ample justice now ," said Emma , laughing , " I will venture to ask , whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first ?
At this moment Mr . Weston appeared at a little distance from the window , evidently on the watch .
I am doatingly fond of music -- passionately fond ;-- and my friends say I am not entirely devoid of taste ; but as to any thing else , upon my honour my performance is _mediocre_ to the last degree .
