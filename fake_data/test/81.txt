" Three - and - twenty !-- is he indeed ?-- Well , I could not have thought it -- and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother !
" Very beautiful , indeed ," replied Emma ; and she spoke so kindly , that he gratefully burst out ,
My behaviour , during the very happy fortnight which I spent with you , did not , I hope , lay me open to reprehension , excepting on one point .
Emma knew that she had , but would not own it ; and Mr . Elton warmly added ,
I have heard her every year of our lives since we both began .
She would be very glad to stay ."
" Oh !
To complete every other recommendation , he had _almost_ told her that he loved her .
It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball , which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy .-- She was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the Eltons , and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike ; and his praise of Harriet , his concession in her favour , was peculiarly gratifying .
She desired nothing better herself .
I wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings .
I felt that , as to fortune , in all probability he might do much better ; and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate , he could not do worse .
She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate , indulgent father ; and had , in consequence of her sister ' s marriage , been mistress of his house from a very early period .
" Be satisfied ," said he , " I will not raise any outcry .
Mr . Elton looked all happiness at this proposition ; and nothing could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage .
" Mrs . Elton , I suppose , has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax owes --"
you have found us out at last , have you , in our seclusion ?-- I was this moment telling Jane , I thought you would begin to be impatient for tidings of us ."
I perfectly understand your situation , however , Miss Woodhouse -- ( looking towards Mr . Woodhouse ), Your father ' s state of health must be a great drawback .
" A man ," said he , " must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks people to leave their own fireside , and encounter such a day as this , for the sake of coming to see him .
You were kept waiting at the door -- I was quite ashamed -- but somehow there was a little bustle -- for it so happened that we had not heard the knock , and till you were on the stairs , we did not know any body was coming .
He is a most amiable , charming young man , I believe .
I absolutely cannot do without music .
To her voluntary communications Emma could get no more approving reply , than ,
-- And he repeated her words with such assurance of accent , such boastful pretence of amazement , that she could not help replying with quickness ,
I rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness than I deserve .
On this article I can fully acquit him .
" My dear , you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be plain , and that you yourself --"
a man does not imagine any such thing .
I have already met with such success in two applications for pardon , that I may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours , and of those among your friends who have had any ground of offence .-- You must all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when I first arrived at Randalls ; you must consider me as having a secret which was to be kept at all hazards .
She always travels with her own sheets ; an excellent precaution .
You have cured her of her school - girl ' s giggle ; she really does you credit ."
Her attention was now claimed by Mr . Woodhouse , who being , according to his custom on such occasions , making the circle of his guests , and paying his particular compliments to the ladies , was ending with her -- and with all his mildest urbanity , said ,
I hope it does him some service with you ."
He is going to Kingston .
Mr . Weston ' s dining - room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably ; and for my part , I would rather , under such circumstances , fall short by two than exceed by two .
" I must not dwell upon it ," said she .--" I must not think of it .
Churchill ."
" Thank you .
" You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax , sir , are you ?"
This was her history ; and particularly interesting it was to Mr . Woodhouse , who commended her very much for thinking of sending for Perry , and only regretted that she had not done it .
And as to conceit , he is the farthest from it of any man I know .
The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove , " My brother Mr . Suckling ' s seat ;"-- a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove .
They have no indoors man , else they do not want for any thing ; and Mrs . Martin talks of taking a boy another year ."
Frank Churchill turned towards her to listen .
She bitterly regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her , and blushed for the envious feelings which had certainly been , in some measure , the cause .
" Miss Fairfax was not well enough to write ;" and when Mr . Perry called at Hartfield , the same morning , it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited , though against her own consent , by himself , and that she was suffering under severe headaches , and a nervous fever to a degree , which made him doubt the possibility of her going to Mrs . Smallridge ' s at the time proposed .
Emma had not to listen to such paradings again -- to any so exclusively addressed to herself -- so disgustingly decorated with a " dear Miss Woodhouse ."
It might be weeks , it might be only a few days , before the horse were useable ; but no preparations could be ventured on , and it was all melancholy stagnation .
" That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast , of my present perfect indifference ," she continued , " I will farther tell you , that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance , when I did like him , when I was very much disposed to be attached to him -- nay , was attached -- and how it came to cease , is perhaps the wonder .
This was all that was generally known of her history .
I was there -- one of the party ."
Harriet was standing at one of the windows .
That is , I know you must have seen her a hundred times -- but are you acquainted ?"
He said no more .
I had not thought of it before , but that is the best way .
I have been making discoveries and forming plans , just like yourself , and I must tell them while the idea is fresh .
Here , she must be leading a life of privation and penance ; there it would have been all enjoyment .
I have not the smallest doubt of the issue .
I am always glad to see him .
And he smiled with such seeming pleasure at the conviction , that she must proceed another step .
You have every body dearest to you always at hand , I , probably , never shall again ; and therefore till I have outlived all my affections , a post - office , I think , must always have power to draw me out , in worse weather than to - day ."
my dear sir , how are you this morning ?
It would not have been the awkwardness of a moment , it would have been rather a pleasure , previous to the suspicions of this very day ; she could have talked to him of Harriet , and the three - quarters of a mile would have seemed but one .
They were both in ecstasies .
" And then their uncle comes in , and tosses them up to the ceiling in a very frightful way !"
" Whatever you say is always right ," cried Harriet , " and therefore I suppose , and believe , and hope it must be so ; but otherwise I could not have imagined it .
He knew of no one but Mrs . Goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or friends .
The strength of the song falls on the second ."
Mrs . Elton , as elegant as lace and pearls could make her , he looked at in silence -- wanting only to observe enough for Isabella ' s information -- but Miss Fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl , and he could talk to her .
There was a seriousness in Harriet ' s manner which prepared her , quite as much as her words , for something more than ordinary .
For the world would not she have seemed to threaten me .-- Imagine the shock ; imagine how , till I had actually detected my own blunder , I raved at the blunders of the post .-- What was to be done ?-- One thing only .-- I must speak to my uncle .
The Churchills might not have a word to say in return ; but then , you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through .
She understood their ways , could allow for their ignorance and their temptations , had no romantic expectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had done so little ; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy , and always gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good - will .
It will be felt so great an attention !
Such a debasement on his !
" My dearest Emma ," said he , " for dearest you will always be , whatever the event of this hour ' s conversation , my dearest , most beloved Emma -- tell me at once .
I cannot really change for the better .
That ' s a consideration indeed .-- But John , as to what I was telling you of my idea of moving the path to Langham , of turning it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows , I cannot conceive any difficulty .
" I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him ."
" Oh !
Emma could not forgive her .
Ambition , as well as love , had probably been mortified .
The manner , perhaps , may have as little to recommend them .
Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home , and thought this the best offer she was likely to have ."
" So early in life -- at three - and - twenty -- a period when , if a man chuses a wife , he generally chuses ill . At three - and - twenty to have drawn such a prize !
and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him , for Frank , I mean , that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as I have always given her credit for -- and still am disposed to give her credit for , in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right .
" I must not dwell upon it ," said she .--" I must not think of it .
Is Perry going to set up his carriage , Frank ?
But " she could never get acquainted with her : she did not know how it was , but there was such coldness and reserve -- such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not -- and then , her aunt was such an eternal talker !-- and she was made such a fuss with by every body !-- and it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate -- because their ages were the same , every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other ."
Harriet would have been a better match .
" Yes ," said Emma , " I hope I do ."
Such talent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknown .-- I dare say you have heard those charming lines of the poet ,
Will you ?
cried Harriet indignantly .--" Oh !
No , my dear little modest Harriet , depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond - street till just before he mounts his horse to - morrow .
" Donwell !"
" Yes , our good Mrs . Elton .
I know what you mean -- but Emma ' s hand is the strongest ."
Just as your drawings always are , my dear .
Do not you pity me ?"
