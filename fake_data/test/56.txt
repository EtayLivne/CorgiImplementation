Nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there .
As she sat one morning , looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day , a note was brought from Mrs . Goddard , requesting , in most respectful terms , to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her ; a most welcome request : for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen , whom Emma knew very well by sight , and had long felt an interest in , on account of her beauty .
There was no resisting such news , no possibility of avoiding the influence of such a happy face as Mr . Weston ' s , confirmed as it all was by the words and the countenance of his wife , fewer and quieter , but not less to the purpose .
" No , I am sure it is not from the Campbells .
With Mr . Weston ' s ball in view at least , there had been a great deal of insensibility to other things ; but it was now too evident that she had not attained such a state of composure as could stand against the actual approach -- new carriage , bell - ringing , and all .
Mr . and Mrs . Elton , indeed , shewed no unwillingness to mix , and be as agreeable as they could ; but during the two whole hours that were spent on the hill , there seemed a principle of separation , between the other parties , too strong for any fine prospects , or any cold collation , or any cheerful Mr . Weston , to remove .
And if they are , I only beg you to send them home ."
" You are prepared for the worst , I see -- and very bad it is .
By that time , it was beginning to hold up , and I was determined that nothing should stop me from getting away -- and then -- only think !-- I found he was coming up towards me too -- slowly you know , and as if he did not quite know what to do ; and so he came and spoke , and I answered -- and I stood for a minute , feeling dreadfully , you know , one can ' t tell how ; and then I took courage , and said it did not rain , and I must go ; and so off I set ; and I had not got three yards from the door , when he came after me , only to say , if I was going to Hartfield , he thought I had much better go round by Mr . Cole ' s stables , for I should find the near way quite floated by this rain .
Mr . Weston , I dare say , has been telling you exactly how the matter stands ?"
Her second duty now , inferior only to her father ' s claims , was to promote Harriet ' s comfort , and endeavour to prove her own affection in some better method than by match - making .
He could say no more ; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him , returned with Mrs . Weston to Mrs . Bates ' s door .
She will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you , Miss Woodhouse , but your kindness will excuse her .
For half an hour Mr . Weston was surprized and sorry ; but then he began to perceive that Frank ' s coming two or three months later would be a much better plan ; better time of year ; better weather ; and that he would be able , without any doubt , to stay considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner .
I was snowed up at a friend ' s house once for a week .
" Was he handsome ?"
There was no getting at her real opinion .
" Indeed !-- from Yorkshire , I think .
Such might be his constitution ; and as she knew that eating and drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints , she recommended his taking some refreshment ; he would find abundance of every thing in the dining - room -- and she humanely pointed out the door .
What am I to do ?"
" Well , well , I am ready ;"-- and turning again to Emma , " but you must not be expecting such a _very_ fine young man ; you have only had _my_ account you know ; I dare say he is really nothing extraordinary :"-- though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very different conviction .
She would have been too happy but for poor Harriet ; but every blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend , who must now be even excluded from Hartfield .
cried Mr . John Knightley , hearing his own name .
" It is certainly very well regulated ."
It had not been forgotten before , but it had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day .
But here there was nothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future .
I have observed , Mrs . Elton , in the course of my life , that if things are going untowardly one month , they are sure to mend the next ."
I said to my mother , ` Upon my word , ma ' am --.'
I am sure I do not know ."
" I am happy you approved ," said Emma , smiling ; " but I hope I am not often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield ."
Her mind was in a state of flutter and wonder , which made it impossible for her to be collected .
Isabella cannot bear to stay behind her husband ."
He listened with all due deference ; acknowledged that he had heard many people say the same -- but yet he must confess , that to him nothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health .
They had not intended to go over till the summer , but she is so impatient to see them again -- for till she married , last October , she was never away from them so much as a week , which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms , I was going to say , but however different countries , and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her mother -- or her father , I declare I do not know which it was , but we shall see presently in Jane ' s letter -- wrote in Mr . Dixon ' s name as well as her own , to press their coming over directly , and they would give them the meeting in Dublin , and take them back to their country seat , Baly - craig , a beautiful place , I fancy .
He was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever ; and , after seeing him , Emma thus moralised to herself :--
But you will do every thing right .
Full of thanks , and full of news , Miss Bates knew not which to give quickest .
Miss Fairfax , you must not run such risks .-- Liable as you have been to severe colds , indeed you ought to be particularly careful , especially at this time of year .
She had been often remiss , her conscience told her so ; remiss , perhaps , more in thought than fact ; scornful , ungracious .
Wrapt up in a cloak of politeness , she seemed determined to hazard nothing .
I never shall forget his manner .
It was well that he took every body ' s joy for granted , or he might not have thought either Mr . Woodhouse or Mr . Knightley particularly delighted .
you amuse me excessively .
after the note I sent him this morning , and the message he returned , that he should certainly be at home till one ."
" The Churchills are very likely in fault ," said Mr . Knightley , coolly ; " but I dare say he might come if he would ."
" So early in life -- at three - and - twenty -- a period when , if a man chuses a wife , he generally chuses ill . At three - and - twenty to have drawn such a prize !
They had been arrived only a few minutes , and Mr . Weston had scarcely finished his explanation of Frank ' s being a day before his time , and her father was yet in the midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations , when she appeared , to have her share of surprize , introduction , and pleasure .
" I dare say they are , sir .
I had no hesitation in advising him to marry .
Was not she the whole day with you ?"
There , it is done .
" He has not been here yet ," replied Emma .
Shall I call upon them ?
You have scolded me too much for match - making , for me to presume to take such a liberty with you .
Emma saw his anxiety , and wishing to appease it , at least for the present , said , and with a sincerity which no one could question --
She blessed the favouring blindness .
And how could it possibly come into your head ?"
And ( raising his voice still more ) I do not see why Miss Fairfax should not be mentioned too .
Only let me be told when I may speak out .-- I wonder whether Jane has any suspicion ."
" She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there .
You will get very tired when tea is over ."
One cannot have too large a party .
" Your command ?-- Yes ."
" The post - office is a wonderful establishment !"
Jane Fairfax did look and move superior ; but Emma suspected she might have been glad to change feelings with Harriet , very glad to have purchased the mortification of having loved -- yes , of having loved even Mr . Elton in vain -- by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend .
" Yes -- entirely her own doing , entirely her own choice ; and Colonel and Mrs . Campbell think she does quite right , just what they should recommend ; and indeed they particularly _wish_ her to try her native air , as she has not been quite so well as usual lately ."
You will express yourself very properly , I am sure .
She admired him for contriving it , though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it was announced .
" Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself ; and then the attraction may be the greater .
He will find an _addition_ to the society of Highbury when he comes again ; that is , if I may presume to call myself an addition .
She might do very well by herself .
Jane desired me to do it , so I always do : and so I began to - day with my usual caution ; but no sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell , than I burst out , quite frightened , with ` Bless me !
It was too old a story .-- Robert Martin had probably ceased to think of Harriet .-- They took a few turns together along the walk .-- The shade was most refreshing , and Emma found it the pleasantest part of the day .
ma ' am , but there may be a difficulty .
But if , which I rather imagine , your making the match , as you call it , means only your planning it , your saying to yourself one idle day , ` I think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr . Weston were to marry her ,' and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards , why do you talk of success ?
" But I ," he soon added , " who have had no such charm thrown over my senses , must still see , hear , and remember .
Whenever she is with us , Mrs . Cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough ; and I must say that Jane deserves it as much as any body can .
Nothing of the sort had ever occurred before to any young ladies in the place , within her memory ; no rencontre , no alarm of the kind ;-- and now it had happened to the very person , and at the very hour , when the other very person was chancing to pass by to rescue her !-- It certainly was very extraordinary !-- And knowing , as she did , the favourable state of mind of each at this period , it struck her the more .
Is it kingdom ?
And the distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first ; for a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind , and sour the temper .
I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town .
She went on herself , to give that portion of time to an old servant who was married , and settled in Donwell .
It was precisely what Emma would have wished , had she deemed it possible enough for wishing .
And he , the very handsomest man that ever was , and a man that every body looks up to , quite like Mr . Knightley !
He was wishing to confide in her -- perhaps to consult her ;-- cost her what it would , she would listen .
" I assure you she did .
Do you think it will look well ?"
Depend upon it , he will be much farther from doing _you_ justice .
cried he .
I really am a most troublesome companion to you both , but I hope I am not often so ill - equipped .
He joined them immediately , and , with scarcely an invitation , seated himself between them .
The style of the letter was much above her expectation .
" Yes , she would be , but that she thinks there will be another put - off .
You provide for the family , you know , ( with a smile at his father ).
John Knightley came ; but Mr . Weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and must be absent on the very day .
It is the greatest absurdity -- Actually snowing at this moment !-- The folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home -- and the folly of people ' s not staying comfortably at home when they can !
and that ' s so dreadful !"
In that very room she had been measured last September , with her two friends .
She hardly wished to have more leisure for them .
Mr . John Knightley was a tall , gentleman - like , and very clever man ; rising in his profession , domestic , and respectable in his private character ; but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally pleasing ; and capable of being sometimes out of humour .
