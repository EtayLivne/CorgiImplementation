He is desperately in love and means to marry her ."
Mrs . Weston told me you were here .-- Oh !
Elton ' s absence just at this time was the very thing to be desired .
Conceive what the events of a week have done in that family !
But Emma still shook her head in steady scepticism .
They are good - natured people , and think little of their own claims ; but still they must feel that any body ' s hurrying away is no great compliment ; and Miss Woodhouse ' s doing it would be more thought of than any other person ' s in the room .
They seem to satisfy every body else ."
For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself .
She plays charmingly ."
" It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined !
As for Isabella , she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the Mr . Westons aside as much as she can ."
Let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of .
I know you are attached to them ."
It was known that they were a little acquainted ; but not a syllable of real information could Emma procure as to what he truly was .
You would not have been so long in coming , if you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury ."
How do you do ?-- Very well , I thank you .
Had you witnessed my behaviour there , I can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well of me again .
" Oh !
I only want to know that Mr . Martin is not very , very bitterly disappointed ."
I do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself , and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them ."
Where I have a regard , I always think a person well - looking .
That was what happened before tea .
" Yes ; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays .
Mrs . Weston , you would be quite laid up ; do not let them talk of such a wild thing .
It was not likely , however , that any body should have equalled her in the date of the plan , as it had entered her brain during the very first evening of Harriet ' s coming to Hartfield .
" I am sorry to find , my love , that my father does not think you looking well -- but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued .
He quitted the militia and engaged in trade , having brothers already established in a good way in London , which afforded him a favourable opening .
Mr . Weston was to call in the evening , and she must return it by him .
How can Emma imagine she has any thing to learn herself , while Harriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority ?
But this was not judged feasible .
He began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick - chamber again , for the present -- to entreat her to _promise_ _him_ not to venture into such hazard till he had seen Mr . Perry and learnt his opinion ; and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course , there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her .
This Emma felt was aimed at her ; and it made her quite angry .
That there was to be such a party had been long generally known : it had even given the idea of another .
Jane did not look round .
" We are going to Box Hill to - morrow ;-- you will join us .
Miss Woodhouse , why are you always so right ?"
He would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided : she was sure he would not -- and she was expecting him every moment to escape into the card - room .
On his side were the inquiries ,--" Was she a horsewoman ?-- Pleasant rides ?-- Pleasant walks ?-- Had they a large neighbourhood ?-- Highbury , perhaps , afforded society enough ?-- There were several very pretty houses in and about it .-- Balls -- had they balls ?-- Was it a musical society ?"
In respectability of character , there can be no doubt that they are .
` Miss Woodhouse calls me the child of good fortune .'
She had a moment ' s fear of Miss Bates keeping away from her .
He could sing a little himself .
" Who shall answer that question ?"
with a deep sigh , that he wished I might find as much happiness in the marriage state as he had done .-- I felt that it would be of a different sort .-- Are you disposed to pity me for what I must have suffered in opening the cause to him , for my suspense while all was at stake ?-- No ; do not pity me till I reached Highbury , and saw how ill I had made her .
Mr . John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother .
Go and eat and drink a little more , and you will do very well .
" Oh !
I am making a conundrum .
Emma spoke for her .
You cannot mean that he has even proposed to her again -- yet .
Two steps , Jane , take care of the two steps .
You will never go to Swisserland .
" I must not hope to be ever situated as you are , in the midst of every dearest connexion , and therefore I cannot expect that simply growing older should make me indifferent about letters ."
" He has been used to her in these complaints , and I hope to - morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report .
Supper was announced .
Mrs . Elton was first seen at church : but though devotion might be interrupted , curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew , and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid , to settle whether she were very pretty indeed , or only rather pretty , or not pretty at all .
Her father -- and Harriet .
" And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess ?-- I pity you .-- I thought you cleverer -- for , depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck .
Still , however , though every thing had not been accomplished by her ingenious device , she could not but flatter herself that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both , and must be leading them forward to the great event .
She knew that at times she must be missed ; and could not think , without pain , of Emma ' s losing a single pleasure , or suffering an hour ' s ennui , from the want of her companionableness : but dear Emma was of no feeble character ; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been , and had sense , and energy , and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations .
Emma watched them in , and then joined Harriet at the interesting counter ,-- trying , with all the force of her own mind , to convince her that if she wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at figured ; and that a blue ribbon , be it ever so beautiful , would still never match her yellow pattern .
" Oh !
Oh !
There was hardly time to talk over the first letter from Enscombe before " Mr . Elton and his bride " was in every body ' s mouth , and Frank Churchill was forgotten .
" A bad thing !
You , whom she had known from an infant , whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour , to have you now , in thoughtless spirits , and the pride of the moment , laugh at her , humble her -- and before her niece , too -- and before others , many of whom ( certainly _some_ ,) would be entirely guided by _your_ treatment of her .-- This is not pleasant to you , Emma -- and it is very far from pleasant to me ; but I must , I will ,-- I will tell you truths while I can ; satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel , and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now ."
I will have nothing to do with it .
The happiness of Miss Smith was quite equal to her intentions .
It used to stand here .
At another time Emma might have been amused , but she was too much astonished now at Mr . Elton ' s spirits for other feelings .
In short , she sat , during the first visit , looking at Jane Fairfax with twofold complacency ; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering justice , and was determining that she would dislike her no longer .
" Thank you , dear Miss Woodhouse , you are all kindness .-- It is impossible to say -- Yes , indeed , I quite understand -- dearest Jane ' s prospects -- that is , I do not mean .-- But she is charmingly recovered .-- How is Mr .
" I hope she does .
I was late ; I met her walking home by herself , and wanted to walk with her , but she would not suffer it .
I know he had horses to - day -- for we arrived together ; and I laughed at him about it , but he said not a word that could betray ."
She introduced him to her friend , Miss Smith , and , at convenient moments afterwards , heard what each thought of the other .
You will stay , and go with us ?"
" If you please , my dear .
Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a difficult question to answer ; Mr . Knightley had once told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman , which she wanted to be thought herself ; and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time , there were moments of self - examination in which her conscience could not quite acquit her .
Mr . Elton ' s rights , however , gradually revived .
Churchill ."
She and the children might stay very well ."
She was , moreover , perpetually hearing about him ; for , excepting when at Hartfield , she was always among those who saw no fault in Mr . Elton , and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns ; and every report , therefore , every guess -- all that had already occurred , all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs , comprehending income , servants , and furniture , was continually in agitation around her .
It struck her with dreadful force , and she was ready to give it every bad name in the world .
She was out ; and I felt it impossible not to wait till she came in .
Other poultry - yards in the neighbourhood also suffered .-- Pilfering was _housebreaking_ to Mr . Woodhouse ' s fears .-- He was very uneasy ; and but for the sense of his son - in - law ' s protection , would have been under wretched alarm every night of his life .
As they were turning into the grounds , Mr . Perry passed by on horseback .
my dear , we cannot begin too early ; you are not aware of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing ."
As to her illness , all nothing of course .
The room at the Crown was to witness it ;-- but it would be better than a common meeting in a crowd .
Her eyes , a deep grey , with dark eye - lashes and eyebrows , had never been denied their praise ; but the skin , which she had been used to cavil at , as wanting colour , had a clearness and delicacy which really needed no fuller bloom .
Emma only nodded , and smiled .-- After a little thinking , and a very tender sigh , he added ,
Will that do ?
" If we were in the other room ," said Emma , " if I had my writing - desk , I am sure I could produce a specimen .
It is very good advice , and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often found ; for it shall be attended to ."
Emma saw his anxiety , and wishing to appease it , at least for the present , said , and with a sincerity which no one could question --
I am very happy .
The boy had , with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his mother ' s , been the means of a sort of reconciliation ; and Mr . and Mrs . Churchill , having no children of their own , nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for , offered to take the whole charge of the little Frank soon after her decease .
said Mr . Weston , looking about .
While waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off , Emma found time , in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her voice and her taste , to look about , and see what became of Mr . Knightley .
