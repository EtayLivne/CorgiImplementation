evil to some is always good to others .
" In short ," said he , " perhaps , Miss Woodhouse -- I think you can hardly be quite without suspicion "--
When he came to Miss Woodhouse , he was obliged to read the whole of it aloud -- all that related to her , with a smile ; a look ; a shake of the head ; a word or two of assent , or disapprobation ; or merely of love , as the subject required ; concluding , however , seriously , and , after steady reflection , thus --
A boyish scheme , indeed !-- I cannot comprehend a man ' s wishing to give a woman any proof of affection which he knows she would rather dispense with ; and he did know that she would have prevented the instrument ' s coming if she could ."
The simplicity and cheerfulness of her nature , her contented and grateful spirit , were a recommendation to every body , and a mine of felicity to herself .
It seemed to him a very ill - judged measure ."
The introduction must be unpleasant , whenever it takes place ; and the sooner it could be over , the better ."
" If you were never particularly struck by her manners before ," said she , " I think you will to - day .
Jane often says , when she is here , ` I am sure , grandmama , you must have had very strong eyes to see as you do -- and so much fine work as you have done too !-- I only wish my eyes may last me as well .'"
Mrs . Weston laughed , and said he did not know what he was talking about .
And in this style he talked on for some time very properly , not much attending to any answer , but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat ; and Emma was quite in charity with him .
Frank Churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of Miss Fairfax ' s situation in life .
This , Harriet , is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us ."
" And who do you think came in while we were there ?"
It seemed as if every thing united to promise the most interesting consequences .
repeated Emma .
" You certainly will meet them if I can prevail ; and I shall call on Miss Bates in my way home ."
" I told you yesterday ," cried Mr . Weston with exultation , " I told you all that he would be here before the time named .
They will be extremely glad to see you , I am sure ; and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way ."
Her silence disturbed him ; and after observing her a little while , he added ,
He always speaks to the purpose ; open , straightforward , and very well judging .
She has been gone longer already than she intended ."
Mr . Elton looked all happiness at this proposition ; and nothing could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage .
To walk by the side of this child , and talk to and question her , was the most natural thing in the world , or would have been the most natural , had she been acting just then without design ; and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead , without any obligation of waiting for her .
You cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me !
Let us be discreet -- quite on our good behaviour .-- Hush !-- You remember those lines -- I forget the poem at this moment :
She had ventured once alone to Randalls , but it was not pleasant ; and a Harriet Smith , therefore , one whom she could summon at any time to a walk , would be a valuable addition to her privileges .
I doubt it .
You and I must positively exert our authority ."
There is always a look of consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be beneath them .
I like him very well ."
Weather becomes absolutely of no consequence .
You know , my dear , she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor was to us .
" He is a most fortunate man !"
" Yes , all of us ; Mrs . Elton would have us come .
Perry ?-- Has he been here this morning ?-- And how does he travel now ?-- Has he set up his carriage ?"
A dinner there must be .
Mr . John Knightley must be in town again on the 28th , and we ought to be thankful , papa , that we are to have the whole of the time they can give to the country , that two or three days are not to be taken out for the Abbey .
At her age she can have no experience , and with her little wit , is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her .
to be a second time the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery .
Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than Emma altogether -- face and figure ?"
Certainly , delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions , Mrs . Elton .
What ever she might feel of brighter hope , she betrayed nothing .
It was kindly said , and very far from giving offence .
But here is my father coming : you will not object to my reading the charade to him .
Frank Churchill comes as regularly into my mind !"
She has talked of it since .
If I find him conversable , I shall be glad of his acquaintance ; but if he is only a chattering coxcomb , he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts ."
Exquisite , quite exquisite !-- Still , however , having proceeded so far , one is unwilling to give the matter up .
" The sooner every party breaks up , the better ."
The idea of Mr . Elton was certainly cheering ; but still , after a time , she was tender - hearted again towards the rejected Mr . Martin .
" Did you ever see such a skin ?-- such smoothness !
Emma had not had time even to think of Mr . Elton , and she was so completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start , and a little blush , at the sound .
That was well done of me ; but there I should have stopped , and left the rest to time and chance .
The possibility of the young man ' s coming to Mrs . Goddard ' s that morning , and meeting with Harriet and pleading his own cause , gave alarming ideas .
" And then their uncle comes in , and tosses them up to the ceiling in a very frightful way !"
Whenever you are transplanted , like me , Miss Woodhouse , you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind .
" Oh !
Elton ?-- That will be a favour indeed !
The idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse , whom she really loved extremely , made her wretched for a while , and when the violence of grief was comforted away , still remained powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it very tolerably .
She is a standing lesson of how to be happy .
It had been a very happy fortnight , and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common course of Hartfield days .
Why should not they explore to Box Hill though the Sucklings did not come ?
Yes , indeed , there is every thing in the world that can make her happy in it .
" Has your son been with you , then ?"
Nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there .
He will find an _addition_ to the society of Highbury when he comes again ; that is , if I may presume to call myself an addition .
He did not know what was come to his master lately , he said , but he could hardly ever get the speech of him .
she is a sweet creature !
" That is the case with us all , papa .
how so ?
I have a great regard for Mr . Perry .
" You had better go on ," said she .
-- Emma had promised ; but still Harriet must be excepted .
They were now approaching the cottage , and all idle topics were superseded .
He had not time to enter into much explanation .
Here am I come down for only one day , and you are engaged with a dinner - party !-- When did it happen before , or any thing like it ?
" The Crown !"
" To be sure , so it is .
Mr . Elton , my astonishment is much beyond any thing I can express .
She was proved to have been universally mistaken ; and she had not quite done nothing -- for she had done mischief .
" I certainly will come .
said she .--" To chuse to remain here month after month , under privations of every sort !
The scene enlarged ; two persons appeared ; Mrs . Weston and her son - in - law ; they were walking into Highbury ;-- to Hartfield of course .
Her present home , he could not but observe , was unfavourable to a nervous disorder :-- confined always to one room ;-- he could have wished it otherwise -- and her good aunt , though his very old friend , he must acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description .
I am sure it was a source of high entertainment to you , to feel that you were taking us all in .-- Perhaps I am the readier to suspect , because , to tell you the truth , I think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same situation .
Perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay , and spared her from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished .
Captain Weston was a general favourite ; and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill , of a great Yorkshire family , and Miss Churchill fell in love with him , nobody was surprized , except her brother and his wife , who had never seen him , and who were full of pride and importance , which the connexion would offend .
They seem very comfortable as they are , and if she were to take any pains to marry him , she would probably repent it .
" He came to their father upon some business , and he asked him to stay to dinner ."
" Indeed , Harriet , it would have been a severe pang to lose you ; but it must have been .
" You may depend upon me ," said she .
" What sort of looking man is Mr .
" She thinks herself wrong , then , for having consented to a private engagement ?"
" You and Miss Smith , and Miss Fairfax , will be three , and the two Miss Coxes five ," had been repeated many times over .
It was hardly right ; but it had been so strong an idea , that it would escape her , and his submission to all that she told , was a compliment to her penetration , which made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue .
A cold stormy rain set in , and nothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs , which the wind was despoiling , and the length of the day , which only made such cruel sights the longer visible .
Mrs . Elton ' s resources were inadequate to such an attack .
There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are .
" Oh !
