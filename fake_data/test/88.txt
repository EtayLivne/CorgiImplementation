Very true .
Then here is my last ,"-- unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman in small size , whole - length --" my last and my best -- my brother , Mr . John Knightley .-- This did not want much of being finished , when I put it away in a pet , and vowed I would never take another likeness .
Here Mr . Weston joined them , and on hearing what was proposed , gave it his decided approbation .
Good soul !
Will not it be beautiful in her dark hair ?"
" So unreasonably early !"
" How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended .
The room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied , and looking forwards ; behind it was another with which it immediately communicated ; the door between them was open , and Emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner .
Mr . Weston is such a good - humoured , pleasant , excellent man , that he thoroughly deserves a good wife ;-- and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for ever , and bear all my odd humours , when she might have a house of her own ?"
The substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma , in a note from Mrs . Weston , instantly .
You and I must positively exert our authority ."
" Nay , nay , read on .-- You will find how very much he suffers ."
But the Martins occupied her thoughts a good deal ; she had spent two very happy months with them , and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit , and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place .
One half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other ."
The advantage of the match I felt to be all on her side ; and had not the smallest doubt ( nor have I now ) that there would be a general cry - out upon her extreme good luck .
Miss Bates was very chatty and good - humoured , as she always is , though she speaks rather too quick .
" Ah !"
This gallant young man , who seemed to love without feeling , and to recommend himself without complaisance , directly handed over the word to Miss Fairfax , and with a particular degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it .
Vigorous , decided , with sentiments to a certain point , not coarse .
I never heard of such a thing .
I give you notice -- You will find me a formidable antagonist on that point .
I beg your pardon .
Her height was pretty , just such as almost every body would think tall , and nobody could think very tall ; her figure particularly graceful ; her size a most becoming medium , between fat and thin , though a slight appearance of ill - health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two .
Do let me hear what she says .'"
I am rather proud of little George .
She was not sorry .
And how beautiful we thought he looked !
I hope whenever poor Isabella ' s little ones have the measles , she will send for Perry ."
And I know he has read the Vicar of Wakefield .
" You are sick of prosperity and indulgence .
Mr . Knightley was to dine with them -- rather against the inclination of Mr . Woodhouse , who did not like that any one should share with him in Isabella ' s first day .
He was too angry to say another word ; her manner too decided to invite supplication ; and in this state of swelling resentment , and mutually deep mortification , they had to continue together a few minutes longer , for the fears of Mr . Woodhouse had confined them to a foot - pace .
" I hope he does ," replied Mr . Knightley coolly , and resuming the letter .
If I had followed her judgment , and subdued my spirits to the level of what she deemed proper , I should have escaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever known .-- We quarrelled .-- Do you remember the morning spent at Donwell ?-- _There_ every little dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis .
Cole ."
" She thinks herself wrong , then , for having consented to a private engagement ?"
Their road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane , a lane leading at right angles from the broad , though irregular , main street of the place ; and , as may be inferred , containing the blessed abode of Mr . Elton .
Your friend Harriet will make a much longer history when you see her .-- She will give you all the minute particulars , which only woman ' s language can make interesting .-- In our communications we deal only in the great .-- However , I must say , that Robert Martin ' s heart seemed for _him_ , and to _me_ , very overflowing ; and that he did mention , without its being much to the purpose , that on quitting their box at Astley ' s , my brother took charge of Mrs . John Knightley and little John , and he followed with Miss Smith and Henry ; and that at one time they were in such a crowd , as to make Miss Smith rather uneasy ."
for the very moment Mr . Cole told Mrs . Cole of it , she sat down and wrote to me .
Mr . Elton , I must beg leave to stop at your house , and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string , or any thing just to keep my boot on ."
" What is the matter , sir ?-- Did you speak to me ?"
Surry is full of beauties ."
The ladies knew better how to allay it .
" One more ;-- they would not fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account , and would only ask for one more ."
The fact is , I suppose , that she is tired of Enscombe .
" I had .
Mr . Knightley and Harriet had arrived during her absence , and were sitting with her father .-- Mr .
" That ' s easily said , and easily felt by you , who have always been your own master .
I want you to call me something else , but I do not know what ."
This is precisely what I wanted .
Be observant of him .
Receive it on my judgment .
As you will do it , it will indeed , to use your own words , be an exquisite possession ."
It is not likely that I _should_ , considering what I have been used to .
But I know they will , because it is a family that a certain lady , of some consequence , at Enscombe , has a particular dislike to : and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or three years , they always are put off when it comes to the point .
VOLUME III
Miss Woodhouse , the comfort of being sometimes alone !"
" Not quite ," returned Emma , with forced calmness , " for all that you then said , appeared to me to relate to a different person .
Not to wait upon a bride is very remiss .
Mr . John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother .
Think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy ; and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it , and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of Mr . Knightley ' s marrying Jane Fairfax , or any body else , which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt .
A word was put in for a second young Cox ; and at last , Mr . Weston naming one family of cousins who must be included , and another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out , it became a certainty that the five couple would be at least ten , and a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they could be disposed of .
Mr . Weston had accompanied her to Mrs . Bates ' s , and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely ; but she having then induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing , was now returned with much more to say , and much more to say with satisfaction , than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs . Bates ' s parlour , with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings , could have afforded .
You and I need not be afraid .
She could tell nothing of Hartfield , in which Mrs . Weston had not a lively concern ; and half an hour ' s uninterrupted communication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life depends , was one of the first gratifications of each .
He had , in fact , been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence .
" Donwell !"
no .
I have some notion of putting such a trimming as this to my white and silver poplin .
Knightley !-- I could not have believed it .
Soon afterwards he began again ,
And she talked in this way so long and successfully that , when forced to give her attention again to her father and sister , she had nothing worse to hear than Isabella ' s kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax ; and Jane Fairfax , though no great favourite with her in general , she was at that moment very happy to assist in praising .
This little explanation with Mr . Knightley gave Emma considerable pleasure .
I shall not attempt calling on Mrs . Goddard , for I really do not think she cares for any thing but _boiled_ pork : when we dress the leg it will be another thing .
Whenever I see her , she always curtseys and asks me how I do , in a very pretty manner ; and when you have had her here to do needlework , I observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it .
It was his duty .
" You forget how much she belongs to Highbury .
Depend upon it , we shall soon hear that it is a present from Mr . and Mrs .
Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be expected ; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits , which appeared perfectly natural , as there was a dentist to be consulted ; but , since that business had been over , she did not appear to find Harriet different from what she had known her before .-- Isabella , to be sure , was no very quick observer ; yet if Harriet had not been equal to playing with the children , it would not have escaped her .
This was all sent with the instrument .
do come in .
It must be all conjecture ."
Though much might be fancy , he could not doubt , when he looked back , that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been half a year ago .
the coldness of a Jane Fairfax !-- Harriet is worth a hundred such -- And for a wife -- a sensible man ' s wife -- it is invaluable .
He had said that Jane Fairfax received attentions from Mrs . Elton which nobody else paid her .
The danger , however , was at present so unperceived , that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her .
He has not such a fine air and way of walking as Mr . Knightley .
At Hartfield , you have had very good specimens of well educated , well bred men .
The touch seemed immediate .
He stopt again , rose again , and seemed quite embarrassed .-- He was more in love with her than Emma had supposed ; and who can say how it might have ended , if his father had not made his appearance ?
Knightley immediately got up , and in a manner decidedly graver than usual , said ,
I behaved shamefully .
It was not lost on me .
no -- I would get you a better partner than myself .
Besides , she is out of health now ; but _that_ indeed , by her own account , she has always been .
Every feeling was offended ; and the forbearance of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of Mr . Weston ' s temper .
Her intentions were unchanged .
" And if you find them troublesome , you must send them home again ."
If I had but her memory !
returned Mr . Knightley , with energy .
