I did not know what to do .
" Thank you ," said he , in an accent of deep mortification , and not another syllable followed .
there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to South End .
While he spoke , Emma ' s mind was most busy , and , with all the wonderful velocity of thought , had been able -- and yet without losing a word -- to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole ; to see that Harriet ' s hopes had been entirely groundless , a mistake , a delusion , as complete a delusion as any of her own -- that Harriet was nothing ; that she was every thing herself ; that what she had been saying relative to Harriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings ; and that her agitation , her doubts , her reluctance , her discouragement , had been all received as discouragement from herself .-- And not only was there time for these convictions , with all their glow of attendant happiness ; there was time also to rejoice that Harriet ' s secret had not escaped her , and to resolve that it need not , and should not .-- It was all the service she could now render her poor friend ; for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection from herself to Harriet , as infinitely the most worthy of the two -- or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever , without vouchsafing any motive , because he could not marry them both , Emma had it not .
She went to Mrs . Goddard ' s accordingly the very next day , to undergo the necessary penance of communication ; and a severe one it was .-- She had to destroy all the hopes which she had been so industriously feeding -- to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred -- and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis - judging in all her ideas on one subject , all her observations , all her convictions , all her prophecies for the last six weeks .
" He had been so fortunate as to -- I forget the precise words -- one has no business to remember them .
But I hope , Miss Woodhouse , that supposing -- that if -- strange as it may appear --.
My dear sir , you are too obliging .-- Is there nobody you would not rather ?-- I am not helpless .
I remembered what I used to do myself .
Do not we rather surpass your expectations ?
The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates .
Mr . Knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to express ; and before he could make any reply , Mr . Woodhouse , whose thoughts were on the Bates ' s , said --
Later in the morning , and just as the girls were going to separate in preparation for the regular four o ' clock dinner , the hero of this inimitable charade walked in again .
cried Emma feelingly .
Mr . Weston is really as kind as herself .
" That is ," replied Mr . Knightley , " she will indulge her even more than she did you , and believe that she does not indulge her at all .
It was a melancholy change ; and Emma could not but sigh over it , and wish for impossible things , till her father awoke , and made it necessary to be cheerful .
She would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place in her mind which Harriet had occupied .
If I draw less , I shall read more ; if I give up music , I shall take to carpet - work .
His good sense and good principles would delight you .-- As far as the man is concerned , you could not wish your friend in better hands .
To those who had no resources it was a different thing ; but my resources made me quite independent .
How , where , when ?-- Let me know it all .
Mr . Woodhouse talked over his alarms , and Emma was in spirits to persuade them away with all her usual promptitude .
He was not calm ; his spirits were evidently fluttered ; there was restlessness about him .
Every body must have seen the snow coming on .
No , no ; she has qualities which may be trusted ; she will never lead any one really wrong ; she will make no lasting blunder ; where Emma errs once , she is in the right a hundred times ."
Ladies can never look ill . And , seriously , Miss Fairfax is naturally so pale , as almost always to give the appearance of ill health .-- A most deplorable want of complexion ."
Harriet ' s sweet easy temper will not mind it ."
" I am sure you were of use to me ," cried Emma .
Knightley is quite the gentleman .
Emma had no longer an alarm for Henry ; his interest was yet safe ; and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment .
" Well , I have so little confidence in my own judgment , that whenever I marry , I hope some body will chuse my wife for me .
Emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment .
" So scrupulous for others ," he continued , " and yet so careless for herself !
Mr . Perry was an intelligent , gentlemanlike man , whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of Mr . Woodhouse ' s life ; and upon being applied to , he could not but acknowledge ( though it seemed rather against the bias of inclination ) that wedding - cake might certainly disagree with many -- perhaps with most people , unless taken moderately .
It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked after her to church .
What were nine miles to a young man ?-- An hour ' s ride .
Mr . Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled ; but the worst was overcome , the idea was given ; time and continual repetition must do the rest .-- To Emma ' s entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr . Knightley ' s , whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome ; and he was soon used to be talked to by each , on every fair occasion .-- They had all the assistance which Isabella could give , by letters of the strongest approbation ; and Mrs . Weston was ready , on the first meeting , to consider the subject in the most serviceable light -- first , as a settled , and , secondly , as a good one -- well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to Mr . Woodhouse ' s mind .-- It was agreed upon , as what was to be ; and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness ; and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it , he began to think that some time or other -- in another year or two , perhaps -- it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place .
She was sorry , very sorry .
She was in dancing , singing , exclaiming spirits ; and till she had moved about , and talked to herself , and laughed and reflected , she could be fit for nothing rational .
no , the meeting is certainly to - day ," was the abrupt answer , which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs . Elton ' s side .-- " I do believe ," she continued , " this is the most troublesome parish that ever was .
It was not in his calmness that she read his comparative difference .
I never heard any county but Surry called so ."
The advantage of the match I felt to be all on her side ; and had not the smallest doubt ( nor have I now ) that there would be a general cry - out upon her extreme good luck .
said she , as they proceeded -- speaking more to assist Mr . Weston in keeping his secret , than with any other view .
She had never been admitted before to be seriously ill .
I shall go abroad for a couple of years -- and when I return , I shall come to you for my wife .
With Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again , and for a longer time than hitherto ; of judging of his general manners , and by inference , of the meaning of his manners towards herself ; of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air ; and of fancying what the observations of all those might be , who were now seeing them together for the first time .
They were sneering and negligent .
But a farmer can need none of my help , and is , therefore , in one sense , as much above my notice as in every other he is below it ."
If you remember any queernesses , set them all to the right account .-- Of the pianoforte so much talked of , I feel it only necessary to say , that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F --, who would never have allowed me to send it , had any choice been given her .-- The delicacy of her mind throughout the whole engagement , my dear madam , is much beyond my power of doing justice to .
" I never saw any gentleman ' s handwriting "-- Emma began , looking also at Mrs . Weston ; but stopped , on perceiving that Mrs . Weston was attending to some one else -- and the pause gave her time to reflect , " Now , how am I going to introduce him ?-- Am I unequal to speaking his name at once before all these people ?
She was not less pleased another day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers , to have Harriet ' s picture .
It is the garden of England , you know .
The difference which Randalls , Randalls alone makes in your goings - on , is very great ."
Emma said it would be awkward ; Mrs . Weston was in distress about the supper ; and Mr . Woodhouse opposed it earnestly , on the score of health .
" And , in return for your acknowledging so much , I will do you the justice to say , that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself .-- Harriet Smith has some first - rate qualities , which Mrs . Elton is totally without .
She was in no hurry at all .
Her influence would have been enough .
Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home , and thought this the best offer she was likely to have ."
Nonsense !
He agreed to it , but with so quiet a " Yes ," as inclined her almost to doubt his real concurrence ; and yet there must be a very distinct sort of elegance for the fashionable world , if Jane Fairfax could be thought only ordinarily gifted with it .
I must have given you up ."
I am sure , rather than run the risk of hurting Mr . and Mrs . Cole , you would stay a little longer than you might wish .
no -- I am grieved to find -- I was on the point of telling you that when I called at Mrs . Goddard ' s door , which I did the very last thing before I returned to dress , I was told that Miss Smith was not better , by no means better , rather worse .
The thing is determined , that is ( laughing affectedly ) as far as I can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master .
" From the very circumstance of its being larger , sir .
" It is as well , perhaps , that I have not had the possibility .
What is to become of that ?-- Very true .
aye , I know your scruples .
It will be felt so great an attention !
Mrs . Cole was telling that she had been calling on Miss Bates , and as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight of a pianoforte -- a very elegant looking instrument -- not a grand , but a large - sized square pianoforte ; and the substance of the story , the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize , and inquiry , and congratulations on her side , and explanations on Miss Bates ' s , was , that this pianoforte had arrived from Broadwood ' s the day before , to the great astonishment of both aunt and niece -- entirely unexpected ; that at first , by Miss Bates ' s account , Jane herself was quite at a loss , quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it -- but now , they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only one quarter ;-- of course it must be from Colonel Campbell .
You are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars .
no "-- and Emma could just catch the words , " so superior to Mr .
You are more likely to have done harm to yourself , than good to them , by interference ."
He must have had a wet ride .-- Yes .-- He meant to walk with her , she found .
After waiting a moment , as if to be sure she intended to say no more , he replied ,
" I shall never be easy till I have seen some of these places .
" This is very true ," said she , " at least as far as relates to me , which was all that was meant -- and it is very shameful .-- Of the same age -- and always knowing her -- I ought to have been more her friend .-- She will never like me now .
She was received with a cordial respect which could not but please , and given all the consequence she could wish for .
I do indeed .
Go , and interfere .
I have no doubt of his having , at times , considerable influence ; but it may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand _when_ it will be ."
A great deal of very reasonable , very just displeasure I had to persuade away .
Donwell Lane is never dusty , and now it is perfectly dry .
The aunt was as tiresome as ever ; more tiresome , because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration of her powers ; and they had to listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast , and how small a slice of mutton for dinner , as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her mother and herself ; and Jane ' s offences rose again .
Dear me , how clever !-- Could it really be meant for me ?"
There is to be no form or parade -- a sort of gipsy party .
I made the best excuses I could for not having been able to wait on him and Mrs . Elton on this happy occasion ; I said that I hoped I _should_ in the course of the summer .
She was sensible of all the affection it evinced .
" Not to my feelings .
I would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible ."
Harriet , tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word , was always very long at a purchase ; and while she was still hanging over muslins and changing her mind , Emma went to the door for amusement .-- Much could not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of Highbury ;-- Mr . Perry walking hastily by , Mr . William Cox letting himself in at the office - door , Mr . Cole ' s carriage - horses returning from exercise , or a stray letter - boy on an obstinate mule , were the liveliest objects she could presume to expect ; and when her eyes fell only on the butcher with his tray , a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full basket , two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone , and a string of dawdling children round the baker ' s little bow - window eyeing the gingerbread , she knew she had no reason to complain , and was amused enough ; quite enough still to stand at the door .
How much worse , had they been obliged to meet !
Donwell and Randalls had received their invitation , and none had come for her father and herself ; and Mrs . Weston ' s accounting for it with " I suppose they will not take the liberty with you ; they know you do not dine out ," was not quite sufficient .
She pondered , but could think of nothing .
Some people were always cross when they were hot .
" No , but it did not absolutely rain when I set out ."
" Might he be trusted with the commission , what infinite pleasure should he have in executing it !
And I hope she will be better off in one respect , and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long ."
