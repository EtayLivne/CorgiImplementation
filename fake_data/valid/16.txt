but Jane Fairfax has them both , Harriet ."
" They told me something ," said Harriet rather hesitatingly ;" but it is nothing of any consequence ."
After the first chat of pleasure he was silent ; and then , in a graver tone , began with ,
said she ; ` well , that is quite unexpected .
She promised to think of it , and advised him to think of it more ; but he was fully convinced , that no reflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject .
I am sure I must have been as white as my gown .
CHAPTER II
Mr . Weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment , and Mrs . Weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance ; and the interesting employment had followed , of reckoning up exactly who there would be , and portioning out the indispensable division of space to every couple .
Emma knew what was coming ; they must have the letter over again , and settle how long he had been gone , and how much he was engaged in company , and what a favourite he was wherever he went , and how full the Master of the Ceremonies ' ball had been ; and she went through it very well , with all the interest and all the commendation that could be requisite , and always putting forward to prevent Harriet ' s being obliged to say a word .
It was dreadfully mortifying ; but Mr . Elton was proving himself , in many respects , the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him ; proud , assuming , conceited ; very full of his own claims , and little concerned about the feelings of others .
The charming Augusta Hawkins , in addition to all the usual advantages of perfect beauty and merit , was in possession of an independent fortune , of so many thousands as would always be called ten ; a point of some dignity , as well as some convenience : the story told well ; he had not thrown himself away -- he had gained a woman of 10 , 000 l . or thereabouts ; and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity -- the first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by distinguishing notice ; the history which he had to give Mrs . Cole of the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious -- the steps so quick , from the accidental rencontre , to the dinner at Mr . Green ' s , and the party at Mrs . Brown ' s -- smiles and blushes rising in importance -- with consciousness and agitation richly scattered -- the lady had been so easily impressed -- so sweetly disposed -- had in short , to use a most intelligible phrase , been so very ready to have him , that vanity and prudence were equally contented .
CHAPTER VIII
" He knew nothing about it , Emma .
Emma scarcely heard what was said .-- Her mind was divided between two ideas -- her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax ; and poor Harriet ;-- and for some time she could only exclaim , and require confirmation , repeated confirmation .
He was giving Harriet information as to modes of agriculture , etc .
This is great news , indeed .
Well , Miss Woodhouse , is he like what you expected ?
But , now that she has written her letters , she says she shall soon be well .
_I_ think seriously of Miss Smith !-- Miss Smith is a very good sort of girl ; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled .
Emma could not but feel all this ; and then , her face -- her features -- there was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered ; it was not regular , but it was very pleasing beauty .
" As to that -- I do not --"
That was your doing , papa .
And , besides , I must give you a hint , Frank ; any want of attention to her _here_ should be carefully avoided .
He had wanted very much to go abroad -- had been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel -- but she would not hear of it .
We admired it so much , that I have ventured to write it into Miss Smith ' s collection .
" Thank you , thank you .-- This is just what I wanted to be assured of .-- Oh !
And Mrs .
" It seems like madness !
What are they saying about Mr .
He was quite delighted .
" Here is something quite new to me .
" But you must have found it very damp and dirty .
She was in gay spirits , and would have prolonged the conversation , wanting to hear the particulars of his suspicions , every look described , and all the wheres and hows of a circumstance which highly entertained her : but his gaiety did not meet hers .
Churchill ."
Emma must do Harriet good : and by supplying her with a new object of interest , Harriet may be said to do Emma good .
" That is ," replied Mr . Knightley , " she will indulge her even more than she did you , and believe that she does not indulge her at all .
the coldness of a Jane Fairfax !-- Harriet is worth a hundred such -- And for a wife -- a sensible man ' s wife -- it is invaluable .
Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech , and saw no alarming symptoms of love .
you have found us out at last , have you , in our seclusion ?-- I was this moment telling Jane , I thought you would begin to be impatient for tidings of us ."
He was reckoned very handsome ; his person much admired in general , though not by her , there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense with :-- but the girl who could be gratified by a Robert Martin ' s riding about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by Mr . Elton ' s admiration .
Oh !
I bring a new proposal on the subject :-- a thought of my father ' s , which waits only your approbation to be acted upon .
It was a private resolution of hers , not communicated to him -- or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction .-- Till yesterday , I know he said he was in the dark as to her plans .
It is always the lady ' s right to decide on the degree of acquaintance .
Emma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement , and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months before him of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends -- for the house was taken for May and June .
It had no advantage of situation ; but had been very much smartened up by the present proprietor ; and , such as it was , there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing eyes .-- Emma ' s remark was --
You had better look about you , and ascertain what you do , and what you mean to do ."
Do you suppose she does not often say all this to herself ?
She supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his clemency ; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in his opinion .
--
Busy as he was , however , the young man was yet able to shew a most happy countenance on seeing Emma again .
So seldom that a letter , among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom , is even carried wrong -- and not one in a million , I suppose , actually lost !
" I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome ."
Every thing turns out for his good .-- He meets with a young woman at a watering - place , gains her affection , cannot even weary her by negligent treatment -- and had he and all his family sought round the world for a perfect wife for him , they could not have found her superior .-- His aunt is in the way .-- His aunt dies .-- He has only to speak .-- His friends are eager to promote his happiness .-- He had used every body ill -- and they are all delighted to forgive him .-- He is a fortunate man indeed !"
But a farmer can need none of my help , and is , therefore , in one sense , as much above my notice as in every other he is below it ."
He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived more evil than good from them .
Knightley immediately got up , and in a manner decidedly graver than usual , said ,
She spoke with great agitation ; and Emma very feelingly replied , " That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now .
that is quite surprising , for we have had a vast deal of rain here .
Depend upon it , he would not like to have his charade slighted , much better than his passion .
Emma could not forgive her .
From Monday next to Saturday , I assure you we have not a disengaged day !-- A woman with fewer resources than I have , need not have been at a loss ."
" He appears rough to you ," said Emma , " because you are so very gentle yourself ; but if you could compare him with other papas , you would not think him rough .
They did as they were desired ; and by the time she judged it reasonable to have done with her boot , she had the comfort of farther delay in her power , being overtaken by a child from the cottage , setting out , according to orders , with her pitcher , to fetch broth from Hartfield .
.
We must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax ."
She was sorry , but could not repent .
Emma ' s colour was heightened by this unjust praise ; and with a smile , and shake of the head , which spoke much , she looked at Mr .
How does Miss Smith do ?
I will say that for you ."
no doubt she had been suffering a great deal : more than any body had ever supposed -- and continual pain would try the temper .
Now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus -- so she was rather disappointed , but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body , for fear of its getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse , who would be so very much concerned !-- Well , this is brilliant !
My dear sir , you really are too bountiful .
She was not yet dancing ; she was working her way up from the bottom , and had therefore leisure to look around , and by only turning her head a little she saw it all .
She is very timid and silent .
he cried , " I wish your father might be half as easily convinced as John will be , of our having every right that equal worth can give , to be happy together .
At first , she thought it was a good deal ; and afterwards , but little .
The clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall .
I shall go abroad for a couple of years -- and when I return , I shall come to you for my wife .
They were going to remove immediately to Richmond .
A fine place , but very retired ."
She will break it to you better than I can .
Now , as we may fairly suppose , he would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady , and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday , it is not unlikely that he should be at Mrs . Goddard ' s to - day ; and she may be detained by a visitor , without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch ."
She talked with a great deal of reason , and at least equal affection -- but she had too much to urge for Emma ' s attention ; it was soon gone to Brunswick Square or to Donwell ; she forgot to attempt to listen ; and when Mrs . Weston ended with , " We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for , you know , but I hope it will soon come ," she was obliged to pause before she answered , and at last obliged to answer at random , before she could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for .
" Harriet , I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning .
This was too true for contradiction .
He had returned to a late dinner , after some days ' absence , and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were well in Brunswick Square .
Miss Bates was obliged to return without success ; Jane was quite unpersuadable ; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her worse .-- Emma wished she could have seen her , and tried her own powers ; but , almost before she could hint the wish , Miss Bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in .
And as for Mrs . Hodges , Wright holds her very cheap indeed .-- She promised Wright a receipt , and never sent it ."
I am a great advocate for timidity -- and I am sure one does not often meet with it .-- But in those who are at all inferior , it is extremely prepossessing .
He had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to Highbury , as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal ; and the greater part of her new acquaintance , disposed to commend , or not in the habit of judging , following the lead of Miss Bates ' s good - will , or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed herself , were very well satisfied ; so that Mrs . Elton ' s praise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do , unimpeded by Miss Woodhouse , who readily continued her first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being " very pleasant and very elegantly dressed ."
I remember her telling me at the ball , that I owed Mrs . Elton gratitude for her attentions to Miss Fairfax .-- I hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss .
" And the staircase -- You know , as I came in , I observed how very like the staircase was ; placed exactly in the same part of the house .
I hope they are quite well .
Now , as her objection was nothing but her very great dislike of Mrs . Elton , of which Mr . Weston must already be perfectly aware , it was not worth bringing forward again :-- it could not be done without a reproof to him , which would be giving pain to his wife ; and she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she would have done a great deal to avoid ; an arrangement which would probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of Mrs . Elton ' s party !
Poor little dears , how glad they will be to come .
Harriet submitted , though her mind could hardly separate the parts , so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a declaration of love .
" I shall hear about you all ," said he ; " that is my chief consolation .
" Good God !"
And _she_ appears so truly good -- there is something so motherly and kind - hearted about her , that it wins upon one directly .
