I hardly know how it has happened ; a little , perhaps , from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was , by her aunt and grandmother , and all their set .
Frank Churchill ' s confession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for more than a word in passing .
They had not been long seated and composed when Mr . Woodhouse , with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh , called his daughter ' s attention to the sad change at Hartfield since she had been there last .
" Well , there _is_ feeling here .-- He does seem to have suffered in finding her ill .-- Certainly , I can have no doubt of his being fond of her .
.
" How d ' ye do ?-- how d ' ye do ?-- We have been sitting with your father -- glad to see him so well .
In short , she sat , during the first visit , looking at Jane Fairfax with twofold complacency ; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering justice , and was determining that she would dislike her no longer .
" Upon my word !
" It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to , if Mr . and Mrs . Weston do not .
He understood what would be welcome ; he could be sure of little else .
My dear Harriet , what are you thinking of ?
Colonel Campbell rather preferred an olive .
A Mrs . Knightley for them all to give way to !-- No -- Mr .
Emma made no answer , and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned , but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone .
" Low , I am afraid , sir , very low ," answered his son ;--" but we shall be indulgent -- especially to any one who leads the way ."
I went for only one night , and could not get away till that very day se ' nnight ."
` Oh !
She never mentioned it before , because she would not alarm us .
Emma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance , and could now engage to think of them all at Randalls any hour of the day , with full confidence in their comfort .
Invite him to dinner , Emma , and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken , but leave him to chuse his own wife .
What has he to do with books ?
So very obliging of Mr . Frank Churchill !
Weston , tell me at once .-- Something has happened in Brunswick Square .
The clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall .
that ' s all .
that ' s a great pity ; for I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , where the waters do agree , it is quite wonderful the relief they give .
He sat a little while in doubt .
" Well , my dear ," he deliberately began , " considering we never saw her before , she seems a very pretty sort of young lady ; and I dare say she was very much pleased with you .
the coldness of a Jane Fairfax !-- Harriet is worth a hundred such -- And for a wife -- a sensible man ' s wife -- it is invaluable .
" My idea of him is , that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of every body , and has the power as well as the wish of being universally agreeable .
The symptoms were favourable .-- Instead of answering , Harriet turned away confused , and stood thoughtfully by the fire ; and though the letter was still in her hand , it was now mechanically twisted about without regard .
To be in company , nicely dressed herself and seeing others nicely dressed , to sit and smile and look pretty , and say nothing , was enough for the happiness of the present hour .
He found he could not be useful , and his feelings were too much irritated for talking .
" Mr . Perry ," said he , in a voice of very strong displeasure , " would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for .
It must not be : and yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance !--
I am sure I never suspected it , you did it so naturally ."
The good was all to myself , by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me .
I will answer for the gentleman ' s indifference ."
She was , moreover , perpetually hearing about him ; for , excepting when at Hartfield , she was always among those who saw no fault in Mr . Elton , and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns ; and every report , therefore , every guess -- all that had already occurred , all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs , comprehending income , servants , and furniture , was continually in agitation around her .
Good Heavens !-- What can be to be _broke_ to me , that does not relate to one of that family ?"
It was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly recommending each to the other .
She must understand you ."
I always deserve the best treatment , because I never put up with any other ; and , therefore , you must give me a plain , direct answer .
You might not see one in a hundred with _gentleman_ so plainly written as in Mr . Knightley .
After receiving a very indifferent education she is left in Mrs . Goddard ' s hands to shift as she can ;-- to move , in short , in Mrs . Goddard ' s line , to have Mrs . Goddard ' s acquaintance .
But you will do every thing right .
It was short , but expressed good sense , warm attachment , liberality , propriety , even delicacy of feeling .
While they were thus comfortably occupied , Mr . Woodhouse was enjoying a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter .
" Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr . Elton ' s marrying , Harriet , is the strongest reproach you can make _me_ .
Compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these words --" I had not a spare moment on Tuesday , as you know , for Miss Woodhouse ' s beautiful little friend .
" Oh !"
It was now about the time that she was likely to call .
" Very ."
And the same may be said of Mrs . Jeffereys -- Clara Partridge , that was -- and of the two Milmans , now Mrs . Bird and Mrs . James Cooper ; and of more than I can enumerate .
" Oh !
" But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired , papa ?"
Oh !
` Oh !'
" And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her !
Your inexperience really amuses me !
Oh !
" I must have asked Miss Fairfax , and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me , after your ' s ."
" I have very little to say for my own conduct .-- I was tempted by his attentions , and allowed myself to appear pleased .-- An old story , probably -- a common case -- and no more than has happened to hundreds of my sex before ; and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up as I do for Understanding .
" I hope he does ," replied Mr . Knightley coolly , and resuming the letter .
One has not great hopes from Birmingham .
-- But , said I , I shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me .--` Oh ,' said he , ` wait half a minute , till I have finished my job ;'-- For , would you believe it , Miss Woodhouse , there he is , in the most obliging manner in the world , fastening in the rivet of my mother ' s spectacles .-- The rivet came out , you know , this morning .-- So very obliging !-- For my mother had no use of her spectacles -- could not put them on .
Good old Mrs . Bates -- I will call upon her to - morrow , and take my children .-- They are always so pleased to see my children .-- And that excellent Miss Bates !-- such thorough worthy people !-- How are they , sir ?"
He must have a pretty good opinion of himself ."
" Ah !
The gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice ; they took themselves off in a hurry .
She wanted to be of use to her ; wanted to shew a value for her society , and testify respect and consideration .
In all probability she was at this very time waited for there ; and Mr . Knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards Mr . Elton , if not towards William Larkins .
If any thing could be more , where all was most , she was more reserved on the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing .
It had no advantage of situation ; but had been very much smartened up by the present proprietor ; and , such as it was , there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing eyes .-- Emma ' s remark was --
Yes , I understand the sort of mind .
With mixed feelings , she seated herself at a little distance from the numbers round the instrument , to listen .
" You think her diffident .
And ever since she was twelve , Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all .
" Well ," said the still waiting Harriet ;--" well -- and -- and what shall I do ?"
" And now we shall just miss them ; too provoking !-- I do not know when I have been so disappointed ."
Only my pattern gown is at Hartfield .
or is it too short ?"
" Those who knew any thing about it , must have felt the difference .
How often have I heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her !"
It was a palpable display , repeated on every possible occasion .
My aunt always sends me off when she is shopping .
Emma had not another word to oppose .
She read , and was surprized .
The thing is determined , that is ( laughing affectedly ) as far as I can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master .
Then changing from a frown to a smile --" No , do not tell me -- I do not want to know what you mean .-- Where is my father ?-- When are we to begin dancing ?"
Mr . Knightley was fortunate in every body ' s most ready concurrence .
Frank Churchill had danced once at Highbury , and longed to dance again ; and the last half - hour of an evening which Mr . Woodhouse was persuaded to spend with his daughter at Randalls , was passed by the two young people in schemes on the subject .
" Very well .
" Ah !
The shower was heavy , but short ; and it had not been over five minutes , when in came Harriet , with just the heated , agitated look which hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give ; and the " Oh !
" Upon my word , Emma ."
And he wrote as if he really loved her very much -- but she did not know -- and so , she was come as fast as she could to ask Miss Woodhouse what she should do .--" Emma was half - ashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful .
" Did she know ?-- had she heard any thing about her , since their being at Randalls ?-- he felt much anxiety -- he must confess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably ."
The event acquitted her of all the fancifulness , and all the selfishness of imaginary complaints .
He must think himself a most agreeable fellow ; I could not do such a thing .
