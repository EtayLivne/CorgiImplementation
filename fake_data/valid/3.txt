" Will he , indeed ?
" Upon my word ," said Emma , " I begin to doubt my having any such talent .
But just got acquainted with Mrs . Weston , and others !-- I hate the recollection ."
A sudden freak seemed to have seized him at breakfast , and he had sent for a chaise and set off , intending to return to dinner , but with no more important view that appeared than having his hair cut .
Two months must bring it to the proof .
It was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character which I knew her to possess ; and the secrecy she had maintained , as to any such design in her former letter , was equally descriptive of its anxious delicacy .
But Emma , in her own mind , determined that he _did_ know what he was talking about , and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in life , and to marry , from worthy motives .
Oh !
Jane was quite longing to go to Ireland , from his account of things ."
" Well , Miss Woodhouse !"
Miss Woodhouse , what a pity that I must not write this beautiful charade into my book !
CHAPTER X
My liveliness and your solidity would produce perfection .-- Not that I presume to insinuate , however , that _some_ people may not think _you_ perfection already .-- But hush !-- not a word , if you please ."
You and I , Emma , will venture to take the part of the poor husband .
Your description of Mrs . Churchill made me think of them directly .
Miss Fairfax , you must not run such risks .-- Liable as you have been to severe colds , indeed you ought to be particularly careful , especially at this time of year .
" Yes ; Jane says she is sure they will ; but yet , this is such a situation as she cannot feel herself justified in declining .
It reminded her of their first forlorn tete - a - tete , on the evening of Mrs . Weston ' s wedding - day ; but Mr . Knightley had walked in then , soon after tea , and dissipated every melancholy fancy .
I do congratulate you , Mrs . Weston , most warmly .
I can hardly believe it .-- I thought I knew him ."
" I think her all you describe .
Actually to discover that Mr . Knightley is a gentleman !
I come in for a pretty good share as a second .
" Yes ," said Emma , " I hope I do ."
She has talked of it since .
CHAPTER III
" Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately ?
Have you finished it ?
You are his object -- and you will soon receive the completest proof of it .
The worn - out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming ; and in the rapidity of half a moment ' s thought , she hoped Mr . Elton would now be talked of no more .
I do not know what she meant , but she asked me if I thought I should go and stay there again next summer ."
Impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort ; if we except , perhaps , Mrs . Suckling ' s own family , and Mrs . Bragge ' s ; but Mrs . Smallridge is intimate with both , and in the very same neighbourhood :-- lives only four miles from Maple Grove .
This Emma felt was aimed at her ; and it made her quite angry .
He began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit of Emma .
Plain dealing was always best .
" I shall not scold you .
But you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield .
Emma demurred .
She touched -- she admitted -- she acknowledged the whole truth .
He cut her short with ,
Small heart had Harriet for visiting .
you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate ."
The contrast between Mrs . Churchill ' s importance in the world , and Jane Fairfax ' s , struck her ; one was every thing , the other nothing -- and she sat musing on the difference of woman ' s destiny , and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed , till roused by Miss Bates ' s saying ,
And that is all that I can recollect of it -- but it is very clever all the way through .
I can imagine , that if you , as you are , Mr . Knightley , were to be transported and placed all at once in Mr . Frank Churchill ' s situation , you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him ; and it might have a very good effect .
" And when she had come away , Mrs . Martin was so very kind as to send Mrs . Goddard a beautiful goose -- the finest goose Mrs . Goddard had ever seen .
The case , you see , is --( but this is quite between ourselves : I did not mention a syllable of it in the other room .
And I will own to you , ( I am sure it will be safe ), that so far as our living with Mr . Churchill at Enscombe , it is settled .
Where features were indifferent , a fine complexion gave beauty to them all ; and where they were good , the effect was -- fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the effect was .
That was the act of a very , very young man , one too young to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure .
He is as well acquainted with his own claims , as you can be with Harriet ' s .
She stopped to breathe .
" My dear Emma , as long as he thinks so , it is so ; but if he really loves Jane Fairfax --"
It was a concern which brought just employment enough .
Perhaps to Hartfield , perhaps to the Abbey Mill , perhaps into his woods .-- Miss Woodhouse , this is not like our friend Knightley !-- Can you explain it ?"
There is health , not merely in her bloom , but in her air , her head , her glance .
I shall talk about it to him ; he will settle for me ; he will help me out of all my difficulties .'
The stupidest fellow !
She was sensible of all the affection it evinced .
Harriet Smith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly , exclusively , passionately loved by Mr . Knightley .
Yes , I immediately perceive that it must be the joint present of Mr . and Mrs . Dixon .
You have made yourself too clear .
" What do you say to Mrs .
The carriage was sent for them now .
" But you should tell them of the letter , my dear ," said her father .
This would not do ; she immediately stopped , under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing of her half - boot , and stooping down in complete occupation of the footpath , begged them to have the goodness to walk on , and she would follow in half a minute .
Now I am secure of you for ever ."
" John does not even mention your friend ," said Mr . Knightley .
" I must not hope to be ever situated as you are , in the midst of every dearest connexion , and therefore I cannot expect that simply growing older should make me indifferent about letters ."
I will say that for you ."
Emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment .
She then took a longer time for consideration .
Emma smiled and answered --" My visit was of use to the nervous part of her complaint , I hope ; but not even I can charm away a sore throat ; it is a most severe cold indeed .
Jane was quite longing to go to Ireland , from his account of things ."
The mistake had been slight .
Here is the rivet of your mistress ' s spectacles out .
The ladies had not been long in the drawing - room , before the other ladies , in their different divisions , arrived .
Such an immense plantation all round it !
It was all read , however , steadily , attentively , and without the smallest remark ; and , excepting one momentary glance at her , instantly withdrawn , in the fear of giving pain -- no remembrance of Box Hill seemed to exist .
" Never , never !"
Young ladies should take care of themselves .-- Young ladies are delicate plants .
But Mr . Knightley is so very fine a man !"
CHAPTER XVI
It is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there !
Her nerves were under continual irritation and suffering ; and by the ten days ' end , her nephew ' s letter to Randalls communicated a change of plan .
" I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of .-- Oh !
" Have you heard from her yourself this morning ?"
I hope not of a putrid infectious sort .
do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax ' s sensations from you , or from any body else .
What do you think of him ?
_Now_ , he said , he was beginning to have no longer the same wish .
" Thank you , thank you .-- This is just what I wanted to be assured of .-- Oh !
He was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning home , but no assurances could convince him that it was safe to stay ; and while the others were variously urging and recommending , Mr . Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences : thus --
Weston .-- " Very well , I thank you , ma ' am .
He had gone away deeply offended -- he came back engaged to another -- and to another as superior , of course , to the first , as under such circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost .
But there is nobody hereabouts to attach her ; and she goes so seldom from home ."
And , in short , from knowing his usual ways , I am very much inclined to think that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all .
the amiable , obliging , gentle Mr .
Her eyes were towards Donwell as she walked , but she saw him not .
Dinner was on table .-- Mrs .
