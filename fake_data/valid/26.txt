Emma looked at her , quite unable to speak .
" Oh !"
" Oh !
" If I know myself , Harriet , mine is an active , busy mind , with a great many independent resources ; and I do not perceive why I should be more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one - and - twenty .
It made him so very unhappy , indeed , that it could not be persevered in .
My blindness to what was going on , led me to act by them in a way that I must always be ashamed of , and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures , but I have no other reason to regret that I was not in the secret earlier ."
You will look back and see that I did not come till Miss Fairfax was in Highbury ; and as _you_ were the person slighted , you will forgive me instantly ; but I must work on my father ' s compassion , by reminding him , that so long as I absented myself from his house , so long I lost the blessing of knowing you .
Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at Mrs . Goddard ' s ; Mr . Elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school ; and it must be at Hartfield only that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth .
They met readily and smiling , but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said ; and having all sat down again , there was for some time such a blank in the circle , that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged , which she had long felt , of seeing Frank Churchill once more , and of seeing him with Jane , would yield its proportion of pleasure .
Voices approached the shop -- or rather one voice and two ladies : Mrs . Weston and Miss Bates met them at the door .
He was a nervous man , easily depressed ; fond of every body that he was used to , and hating to part with them ; hating change of every kind .
" Depend upon it , Mrs . Churchill does every thing that any other fine lady ever did .
said Emma .
Emma could hardly understand him ; he seemed in an odd humour .
Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin ."
Every body is so surprized ; and every body says the same obliging things .
We had great amusement with those letters one morning .
You are trying not to smile ."
The quiet , heart - felt satisfaction of the old lady , and the rapturous delight of her daughter -- who proved even too joyous to talk as usual , had been a gratifying , yet almost an affecting , scene .
What shall we do to rouse them ?
Poor little creatures , how unhappy she would have made them !"
We must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax ."
But , perhaps -- I may be equally in the way here .
" They would have solicited the honour earlier , but had been waiting the arrival of a folding - screen from London , which they hoped might keep Mr . Woodhouse from any draught of air , and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour of his company ."
He had been sitting with her , it appeared , most companionably at home , till her usual hour of exercise ; and on being desired to chuse their walk , immediately fixed on Highbury .--" He did not doubt there being very pleasant walks in every direction , but if left to him , he should always chuse the same .
" Not quite ," returned Emma , with forced calmness , " for all that you then said , appeared to me to relate to a different person .
It is what we happily have never known any thing of ; but it must be a life of misery .
Harriet slept at Hartfield that night .
said he .
" Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced .
Quite thick shoes .
Mr . Woodhouse at last was off ; but Mr . Knightley , instead of being immediately off likewise , sat down again , seemingly inclined for more chat .
When she looked at the hedges , she thought the elder at least must soon be coming out ; and when she turned round to Harriet , she saw something like a look of spring , a tender smile even there .
The day came , the party were punctually assembled , and Mr . John Knightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable .
Many circumstances assisted the temptation .
" The sooner every party breaks up , the better ."
He wanted to marry well , and having the arrogance to raise his eyes to her , pretended to be in love ; but she was perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for .
Emma watched them in , and then joined Harriet at the interesting counter ,-- trying , with all the force of her own mind , to convince her that if she wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at figured ; and that a blue ribbon , be it ever so beautiful , would still never match her yellow pattern .
I hope , with all my heart , the young man may be a Weston in merit , and a Churchill in fortune .-- But Harriet Smith -- I have not half done about Harriet Smith .
She might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison , while a sharer of his conversation with her friend ; and from the best , the purest of motives , might now be denying herself this visit to Ireland , and resolving to divide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty .
I knew he would !"
And woman , lovely woman , reigns alone .
But I was really quite shocked the other day -- for Mr . Knightley called one morning , and Jane was eating these apples , and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them , and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock .
To take her -- be it only an hour or two -- from her aunt , to give her change of air and scene , and quiet rational conversation , even for an hour or two , might do her good ; and the following morning she wrote again to say , in the most feeling language she could command , that she would call for her in the carriage at any hour that Jane would name -- mentioning that she had Mr . Perry ' s decided opinion , in favour of such exercise for his patient .
" Ever since the day -- about four years ago -- that Miss Taylor and I met with him in Broadway Lane , when , because it began to drizzle , he darted away with so much gallantry , and borrowed two umbrellas for us from Farmer Mitchell ' s , I made up my mind on the subject .
I do not care for myself .
" And , moreover , if you must go to the sea , it had better not have been to South End .
And I am not only , not going to be married , at present , but have very little intention of ever marrying at all ."
My playing is no more like her ' s , than a lamp is like sunshine ."
It was badly done , indeed !
and I can account for it only in one way ; you are not yourself , or you could not speak either to me , or of Harriet , in such a manner .
Their love of society , and their new dining - room , prepared every body for their keeping dinner - company ; and a few parties , chiefly among the single men , had already taken place .
" What !
Mrs . Weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage ; and neither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded at supper .
_Now_ I shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you ."
The impossibility of her quitting her father , Mr . Knightley felt as strongly as herself ; but the inadmissibility of any other change , he could not agree to .
There , not to be vulgar , was distinction , and merit .
I give you credit for it .
He was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern .
" Oh no , no !
" Ah !
At present , there was nothing to be done for Harriet ; good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible on Emma ' s side .
When they all sat down it was better ; to her taste a great deal better , for Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay , making her his first object .
The time of year lightened the evil to him .
I hope not of a putrid infectious sort .
Harriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful .
A week had not passed since Miss Hawkins ' s name was first mentioned in Highbury , before she was , by some means or other , discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind ; to be handsome , elegant , highly accomplished , and perfectly amiable : and when Mr . Elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects , and circulate the fame of her merits , there was very little more for him to do , than to tell her Christian name , and say whose music she principally played .
" A straightforward , open - hearted man like Weston , and a rational , unaffected woman like Miss Taylor , may be safely left to manage their own concerns .
Knightley was at Hartfield yesterday , and spoke of it as for Saturday ."
If it can be contrived to be at the Crown , papa , it will be very convenient for the horses .
" But , my dear sir ," cried Mr . Weston , " if Emma comes away early , it will be breaking up the party ."
Decidedly , I think , a very gentleman - like man ."
It was a melancholy change ; and Emma could not but sigh over it , and wish for impossible things , till her father awoke , and made it necessary to be cheerful .
I have no pleasure in seeing my friends , unless I can believe myself fit to be seen ."
I did not know what to do .
-- She thought he neither looked nor spoke cheerfully ; and the first possible cause for it , suggested by her fears , was , that he had perhaps been communicating his plans to his brother , and was pained by the manner in which they had been received .
It inspired little more than an animating curiosity .
" So extremely like Maple Grove !
It was not in compliment to Jane Fairfax however that he was so indifferent , or so indignant ; he was not guided by _her_ feelings in reprobating the ball , for _she_ enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree .
I hardly know how it has happened ; a little , perhaps , from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was , by her aunt and grandmother , and all their set .
He had expressed himself as to coming , with more than common certainty .
always my kindest friend on every occasion .
His good - nature , his humanity , as I tell you , would be quite enough to account for the horses .
Emma could not forgive her ;-- but as neither provocation nor resentment were discerned by Mr . Knightley , who had been of the party , and had seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side , he was expressing the next morning , being at Hartfield again on business with Mr . Woodhouse , his approbation of the whole ; not so openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room , but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to Emma .
She had nothing to wish otherwise , but that the days did not pass so swiftly .
The present crisis , indeed , seemed to be brought on by them ; and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct ."
She knows their ways best ; but I should not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present .
He must do it all himself .
What say you to Mr . Weston and Mr . Elton ?
" No , no ; your room is full enough .
Yes , Harriet , just so long have I been wanting the very circumstance to happen what has happened .
" Thank you .
He stays till to - morrow , and Miss Fairfax has been persuaded to spend the day with us .-- They are coming in , I hope ."
Your friend will not take it amiss I hope .
was her immediate exclamation .
There could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her .
Emma even jumped with surprize ;-- and , horror - struck , exclaimed ,
Donwell Lane is never dusty , and now it is perfectly dry .
said he to Emma , and trying , as he spoke , to catch Miss Fairfax ' s eye .
He comes to Highbury himself , he says , six days out of the seven , and has always business at Ford ' s .
