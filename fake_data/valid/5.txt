I shall be no support to Mrs . Weston .
She would have been too happy but for poor Harriet ; but every blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend , who must now be even excluded from Hartfield .
" Well , Emma , I do not believe I have any thing more to say about the boys ; but you have your sister ' s letter , and every thing is down at full length there we may be sure .
" My dear , you do not understand me .
But Mr . Knightley is so very fine a man !"
Emma looked graciously .
" No , sir ," replied his son , laughing , " I seem to have had it from nobody .-- Very odd !-- I really was persuaded of Mrs . Weston ' s having mentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe , many weeks ago , with all these particulars -- but as she declares she never heard a syllable of it before , of course it must have been a dream .
Every thing so good !"
" It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to Hartfield .
" Such attentions as Mrs . Elton ' s , I should have imagined , would rather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax .
He loved to have the cloth laid , because it had been the fashion of his youth , but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it ; and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing , his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat .
Emma had not been thinking of him , she had forgotten to think of him -- but she was very glad to see him .
" Me !"
" Ever hear her !"
I met him just now .
His visit he would now defer ; but they had a very interesting parley about what could be done and should be done .
Being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling , I have been in no hurry with my congratulations ; but I hope it all went off tolerably well .
Witness this very time .
.
If _we_ exert ourselves , I think we shall not be long in want of allies .
Don ' t disturb him .
I do not know any body who draws so well as you do .
" Will he , indeed ?
He had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle ; his horror of late hours , and large dinner - parties , made him unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit him on his own terms .
It would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love with a proper object .
By this time , the walk in the rain had reached Mrs . Elton , and her remonstrances now opened upon Jane .
" So unreasonably early !"
This wretched note was the finale of Emma ' s breakfast .
" Such an imagination has crossed me , I own , Emma ; and if it never occurred to you before , you may as well take it into consideration now ."
The advantage of the match I felt to be all on her side ; and had not the smallest doubt ( nor have I now ) that there would be a general cry - out upon her extreme good luck .
He certainly might have heard Mr . Elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done , and Mr . Elton might not be of an imprudent , inconsiderate disposition as to money matters ; he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them ; but then , Mr . Knightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives .
Emma listened with the warmest concern ; grieved for her more and more , and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful .
Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr . Weston , and had half a mind to take it up ; but she struggled , and let it pass .
Mr . Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile ; and succeeded without difficulty , upon Mrs . Elton ' s beginning to talk to him .
There are secrets in all families , you know )-- The case is , that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in January ; and that Frank ' s coming depends upon their being put off .
" That is to say , you chose to have your walk , for you were not six yards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you ; and Henry and John had seen more drops than they could count long before .
my dear ; but so much as Patty has to do !-- And it is a kindness to employ our men ."
Tell me how Miss Fairfax is ."
We really seem quite the fashion .
No , indeed , Miss Woodhouse , you need not be afraid ; I can sit and admire him now without any great misery .
" Oh !
He rode down for a couple of hours ; he could not yet do more ; but as he came from Randalls immediately to Hartfield , she could then exercise all her quick observation , and speedily determine how he was influenced , and how she must act .
In this style she ran on ; never thoroughly stopped by any thing till Mr . Woodhouse came into the room ; her vanity had then a change of object , and Emma heard her saying in the same half - whisper to Jane ,
Sorrow came -- a gentle sorrow -- but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness .-- Miss Taylor married .
" Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell ," said she , in a voice of forced calmness , " I can imagine nothing with any confidence .
` Oh !'
" Oh !
Emma ' s colour was heightened by this unjust praise ; and with a smile , and shake of the head , which spoke much , she looked at Mr .
Such things in general cannot be too short ."
He feared there must be some decided involvement .
Late hours do not agree with us .
" Oh !
It was his jealousy of Frank Churchill that had taken him from the country .-- The Box Hill party had decided him on going away .
You will excuse her not coming to you -- she is not able -- she is gone into her own room -- I want her to lie down upon the bed .
There , not to be vulgar , was distinction , and merit .
Might not the evening end in a dance ?
_Courtship_ -- a very good hint .
" Yes : but a young lady -- a bride -- I ought to have paid my respects to her if possible .
" No -- Mrs . Knightley ;-- and till she is in being , I will manage such matters myself ."
If I draw less , I shall read more ; if I give up music , I shall take to carpet - work .
You like Mr . Elton , papa ,-- I must look about for a wife for him .
" Yes -- I have some right to that knowledge ; though I have never been at the place in my life .-- She is an odd woman !-- But I never allow myself to speak ill of her , on Frank ' s account ; for I do believe her to be very fond of him .
exclaimed Emma .
Emma waited the result with impatience , but not without strong hopes .
And as to conceit , he is the farthest from it of any man I know .
The want of proper families in the place , and the conviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted to attend , were mentioned ; but he was not satisfied .
a word to the wise .-- I am in a fine flow of spirits , an ' t I ?
That would have been too dreadful !-- What an escape !-- Dear Miss Woodhouse , I would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world ."
Undoubtedly if you wish it , I will endeavour to persuade them both ."
Now , my dear madam , I will release you ; but I could not conclude before .
Mr . Woodhouse was almost as glad to see him now , as he would have been sorry to see him before .
" Very nicely dressed , indeed ; a remarkably elegant gown ."
Harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account .
" Very well ," replied Emma ; " a most natural feeling ; and the longer it lasts , the better I shall be pleased .
.
" I do not see much sign of it .
What do you imagine his age to be ?"
There was no time for farther remark or explanation .
Miss Woodhouse , how ungrateful I have been !"
" She must have some motive , more powerful than appears , for refusing this invitation ," was Emma ' s conclusion .
Emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about Mr . Frank Churchill ' s not coming , except as a disappointment at Randalls .
Compare Mr . Martin with either of _them_ .
I knew you would wish it .
And I hope she will be better off in one respect , and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long ."
The time was coming when the news must spread farther , and other persons ' reception of it tried .
But on the other hand , as Emma wants to see her better informed , it will be an inducement to her to read more herself .
I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards myself ; but , otherwise , I should loudly protest against the share of it which that woman has known .-- ` Jane ,' indeed !-- You will observe that I have not yet indulged myself in calling her by that name , even to you .
I honour that part of the attention particularly ; it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart .
Without his sanction I could not hope to be listened to again .-- I spoke ; circumstances were in my favour ; the late event had softened away his pride , and he was , earlier than I could have anticipated , wholly reconciled and complying ; and could say at last , poor man !
" My dear Miss Woodhouse ," said the latter , " I am just run across to entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while , and give us your opinion of our new instrument ; you and Miss Smith .
she cried with a most open eagerness --" Never , for the twentieth part of a moment , did such an idea occur to me .
A room at an inn was always damp and dangerous ; never properly aired , or fit to be inhabited .
" That Mr . Elton should really be in love with me ,-- me , of all people , who did not know him , to speak to him , at Michaelmas !
.
A poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities , or neither .
I should not be helped so soon , but it smells most excellent , and I cannot help beginning ."
These letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick .
She and Mr . Frank Churchill had been at Weymouth at the same time .
She recovered her voice .
They were a couple worth looking at .
