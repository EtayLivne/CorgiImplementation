" I have made a most wretched discovery ," said he , after a short pause .-- " I have been here a week to - morrow -- half my time .
Bates ?"
" Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old .
Mrs . Weston had been delighted before , and was delighted again ; Emma joined her in all her praise ; and the pianoforte , with every proper discrimination , was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise .
She had reason to believe her nearly recovered from her cold , and it was desirable that she should have as much time as possible for getting the better of her other complaint before the gentleman ' s return .
" Ah !
who can think of Miss Smith , when Miss Woodhouse is near !
Emma grew sick at the sound .
He had received a good education , but , on succeeding early in life to a small independence , had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged , and had satisfied an active , cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of his county , then embodied .
He had been detained by a temporary increase of illness in her ; a nervous seizure , which had lasted some hours -- and he had quite given up every thought of coming , till very late ;-- and had he known how hot a ride he should have , and how late , with all his hurry , he must be , he believed he should not have come at all .
It had been serviceable in deadening the first shock , without retaining any influence to alarm .
Nothing wanting .
But it is his gratitude on Harriet ' s account ."
I had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it ."
And if poor little Anna Weston is to be spoiled , it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as you have done for me , except falling in love with her when she is thirteen ."
Mr . Churchill ' s loss would be dreadful indeed .
I have not forgotten it , I assure you .-- Deceived myself , I did very miserably deceive you -- and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever .
His admiration was certainly very warm ; yet she thought , but for Mrs . Weston , it would not have struck her .
They will be so very happy to see you ."
He and Mrs . Weston were both dreadfully desponding .
" What an excellent device ," said he , " the use of a sheepskin for carriages .
He knows he is wrong , and has nothing rational to urge .-- Bad .-- He ought not to have formed the engagement .--` His father ' s disposition :'-- he is unjust , however , to his father .
She felt herself a most fortunate woman ; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought , where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled , and who could ill bear to part with her .
" Aye , that ' s very just , indeed , that ' s very properly said .
Emma knew it to have been very much the case .
Can it be woman ?
How they were all to be conveyed , he would have made a difficulty if he could , but as his son and daughter ' s carriage and horses were actually at Hartfield , he was not able to make more than a simple question on that head ; it hardly amounted to a doubt ; nor did it occupy Emma long to convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for Harriet also .
Harriet was not insensible of manner ; she had voluntarily noticed her father ' s gentleness with admiration as well as wonder .
How the trampers might have behaved , had the young ladies been more courageous , must be doubtful ; but such an invitation for attack could not be resisted ; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen children , headed by a stout woman and a great boy , all clamorous , and impertinent in look , though not absolutely in word .-- More and more frightened , she immediately promised them money , and taking out her purse , gave them a shilling , and begged them not to want more , or to use her ill .-- She was then able to walk , though but slowly , and was moving away -- but her terror and her purse were too tempting , and she was followed , or rather surrounded , by the whole gang , demanding more .
He must know that the Woodhouses had been settled for several generations at Hartfield , the younger branch of a very ancient family -- and that the Eltons were nobody .
Her way was clear , though not quite smooth .-- She spoke then , on being so entreated .-- What did she say ?-- Just what she ought , of course .
"' Tis twelve ; I shall not forget to think of you four hours hence ; and by this time to - morrow , perhaps , or a little later , I may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here .
The weather continued much the same all the following morning ; and the same loneliness , and the same melancholy , seemed to reign at Hartfield -- but in the afternoon it cleared ; the wind changed into a softer quarter ; the clouds were carried off ; the sun appeared ; it was summer again .
Come , he knows himself there .
Something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way through a storm of snow ."
In this age of literature , such collections on a very grand scale are not uncommon .
yes -- she will have her own room , of course ; the room she always has ;-- and there is the nursery for the children ,-- just as usual , you know .
He had long made up his mind to Jane Fairfax ' s going out as governess , and could talk of it cheerfully , but Mr . Knightley ' s going to London had been an unexpected blow .
We shall have no occasion to open the windows at all -- not once the whole evening ; and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows , letting in cold air upon heated bodies , which ( as you well know , sir ) does the mischief ."
He has imposed on me , but he has not injured me .
I should be as ready to acknowledge his merits as any other man ; but I hear of none , except what are merely personal ; that he is well - grown and good - looking , with smooth , plausible manners ."
" But , my dear papa , it is supposed to be summer ; a warm day in summer .
The scene enlarged ; two persons appeared ; Mrs . Weston and her son - in - law ; they were walking into Highbury ;-- to Hartfield of course .
Miss Bates , let Emma help you to a _little_ bit of tart -- a _very_ little bit .
Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who were the parents , but Harriet could not tell .
" I must have asked Miss Fairfax , and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me , after your ' s ."
If _we_ exert ourselves , I think we shall not be long in want of allies .
" My dear sir , upon no account in the world ; my father can direct me ."
Knightley .--" Robert Martin ' s manners have sense , sincerity , and good - humour to recommend them ; and his mind has more true gentility than Harriet Smith could understand ."
It can be round in five minutes ."
The rest of the party were now returning , and all were soon collected .
I remember one evening the poor boys saying , ` Uncle seems always tired now .'"
" Nothing can be actually settled yet , perhaps ," replied Emma , smiling --" but , excuse me , it must be thought of ."
She hardly knew yet what Mr . Knightley would ask ; but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution of never quitting her father .-- She even wept over the idea of it , as a sin of thought .
here it is .
Miss Campbell always was absolutely plain -- but extremely elegant and amiable ."
I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith .
His dejection was most evident .
exclaimed Mr . Knightley loudly and warmly ; and with calmer asperity , added , a few moments afterwards , " No , he is not her equal indeed , for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation .
You seem shut out from every thing -- in the most complete retirement .-- And Mrs . Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion .
" Oh !
You have made yourself too clear .
I was ready to have gone with her , but this will do just as well .
" Miss Woodhouse ," said Frank Churchill , after examining a table behind him , which he could reach as he sat , " have your nephews taken away their alphabets -- their box of letters ?
Miss Nash , head - teacher at Mrs . Goddard ' s , had written out at least three hundred ; and Harriet , who had taken the first hint of it from her , hoped , with Miss Woodhouse ' s help , to get a great many more .
" I do not know why you should say so .
The bustle and joy of such an arrival , the many to be talked to , welcomed , encouraged , and variously dispersed and disposed of , produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne under any other cause , nor have endured much longer even for this ; but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her father were so respected by Mrs . John Knightley , that in spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones , and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance , all the eating and drinking , and sleeping and playing , which they could possibly wish for , without the smallest delay , the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him , either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them .
She has not the least idea ."
He was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern .
if you knew how much I love every thing that is decided and open !-- Good - bye , good - bye ."
united , ( _courtship_ , you know ,) what reverse we have !
That he might not be irritated into an absolute fever , by the fire which Mr . Woodhouse ' s tender habits required almost every evening throughout the year , he soon afterwards took a hasty leave , and walked home to the coolness and solitude of Donwell Abbey .
" Oh , Mrs . Churchill ; every body knows Mrs . Churchill ," replied Isabella : " and I am sure I never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion .
They are but too apt to give up music ."
What has it been but a system of hypocrisy and deceit ,-- espionage , and treachery ?-- To come among us with professions of openness and simplicity ; and such a league in secret to judge us all !-- Here have we been , the whole winter and spring , completely duped , fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and honour , with two people in the midst of us who may have been carrying round , comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both to hear .-- They must take the consequence , if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable !"
Every part of it brought pain and humiliation , of some sort or other ; but , compared with the evil to Harriet , all was light ; and she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken -- more in error -- more disgraced by mis - judgment , than she actually was , could the effects of her blunders have been confined to herself .
Mr . Elton was still talking , still engaged in some interesting detail ; and Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday ' s party at his friend Cole ' s , and that she was come in herself for the Stilton cheese , the north Wiltshire , the butter , the cellery , the beet - root , and all the dessert .
cried Harriet .
I wanted to keep it from Jane ' s knowledge ; but , unluckily , I had mentioned it before I was aware ."
Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess , the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint ; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away , they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached , and Emma doing just what she liked ; highly esteeming Miss Taylor ' s judgment , but directed chiefly by her own .
He had been going to call on them .
I do not know what she meant , but she asked me if I thought I should go and stay there again next summer ."
Mr . John Knightley was a tall , gentleman - like , and very clever man ; rising in his profession , domestic , and respectable in his private character ; but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally pleasing ; and capable of being sometimes out of humour .
" Well , my dear Jane , I believe we must be running away .
This is in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it now is ; but I do not know that I expect it will ; I do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man -- I do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy .-- His feelings are warm , but I can imagine them rather changeable .-- Every consideration of the subject , in short , makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved .-- I shall do very well again after a little while -- and then , it will be a good thing over ; for they say every body is in love once in their lives , and I shall have been let off easily ."
A worthy employment for a young lady ' s mind !
He hesitated , got up , walked to a window .
How , where , when ?-- Let me know it all .
Whenever I see her , she always curtseys and asks me how I do , in a very pretty manner ; and when you have had her here to do needlework , I observe she always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it .
Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her so happily married ."
Emma could say no more .
Oh no !
She was , in fact , beginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing at all ; and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very disagreeable feelings , that , except in a moral light , as a penance , a lesson , a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind , she would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again .
He was the son of Mr . Weston -- he was continually here -- I always found him very pleasant -- and , in short , for ( with a sigh ) let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously , they all centre in this at last -- my vanity was flattered , and I allowed his attentions .
" Open the windows !-- but surely , Mr . Churchill , nobody would think of opening the windows at Randalls .
But you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own .
Frank Churchill ' s character was not desperate .-- She was his own Emma , by hand and word , when they returned into the house ; and if he could have thought of Frank Churchill then , he might have deemed him a very good sort of fellow .
" Well , he is coming , you see ; good news , I think .
Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young , handsome , rich , nor married .
she cried in evident embarrassment , " it all meant nothing ; a mere joke among ourselves ."
