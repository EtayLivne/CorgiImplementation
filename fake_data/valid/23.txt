There go you and your riddle - book one of these days ."
She could never quit him ."
Mrs . Weston was disengaged and Emma began again --" Mr . Frank Churchill writes one of the best gentleman ' s hands I ever saw ."
This letter must make its way to Emma ' s feelings .
I like him very much .
" Yes ; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays .
Mrs . Dixon has persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly .
" Oh !
There does seem to be a something in the air of Hartfield which gives love exactly the right direction , and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow .
.
Emma , alone with her father , had half her attention wanted by him while he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry -- and to marry strangers too -- and the other half she could give to her own view of the subject .
" This would soon have led to something better , of course ," was her consoling reflection ; " any thing interests between those who love ; and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart .
A man at his age -- what is he ?-- three or four - and - twenty -- cannot be without the means of doing as much as that .
I will attack them with more address .
He was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern .
Though I think he had better not have married .
I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly what every man delights in -- what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment .
Harriet could not long resist so delightful a persuasion .
" Indeed !-- from Yorkshire , I think .
" I went only to the post - office ," said she , " and reached home before the rain was much .
Mr . Elton cared little about it , compared with his wife ; he only hoped " the young lady ' s pride would now be contented ;" and supposed " she had always meant to catch Knightley if she could ;" and , on the point of living at Hartfield , could daringly exclaim , " Rather he than I !"
Had she followed Mr . Knightley ' s known wishes , in paying that attention to Miss Fairfax , which was every way her due ; had she tried to know her better ; had she done her part towards intimacy ; had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith ; she must , in all probability , have been spared from every pain which pressed on her now .-- Birth , abilities , and education , had been equally marking one as an associate for her , to be received with gratitude ; and the other -- what was she ?-- Supposing even that they had never become intimate friends ; that she had never been admitted into Miss Fairfax ' s confidence on this important matter -- which was most probable -- still , in knowing her as she ought , and as she might , she must have been preserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr . Dixon , which she had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself , but had so unpardonably imparted ; an idea which she greatly feared had been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane ' s feelings , by the levity or carelessness of Frank Churchill ' s .
Harriet listened , and Emma drew in peace .
Emma felt they were friends again ; and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction , and then a little sauciness , she could not help saying , as he was admiring the baby ,
Good fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health , and I dare say in her ' s .
yes , perfectly .-- Why do you make a doubt of it ?"
What ever she might feel of brighter hope , she betrayed nothing .
He sat musing a little while , and then said ,
At this moment whom are you thinking of ?"
Frank Churchill returned to his station by Emma ; and as soon as Miss Bates was quiet , she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse of Mrs . Elton and Miss Fairfax , who were standing a little way behind her .-- He was thoughtful .
I have no business to put myself forward ."
When I am quite determined as to the time , I am not at all afraid of being long unemployed .
There was certainly no harm in his travelling sixteen miles twice over on such an errand ; but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it which she could not approve .
Dear Mrs . Weston !
This had just taken place and with great cordiality , when John Knightley made his appearance , and " How d ' ye do , George ?"
He wished the road might be impassable , that he might be able to keep them all at Randalls ; and with the utmost good - will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body , calling on his wife to agree with him , that with a little contrivance , every body might be lodged , which she hardly knew how to do , from the consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house .
He shook his head with a smile , and looked as if he had very little doubt and very little mercy .
The rest of the day , the following night , were hardly enough for her thoughts .-- She was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had rushed on her within the last few hours .
This she had been prepared for when she entered the house ; but meant , having once talked him handsomely over , to be no farther incommoded by any troublesome topic , and to wander at large amongst all the Mistresses and Misses of Highbury , and their card - parties .
dear , Miss Woodhouse -- well , at last , I fancy , he looked round and saw me ; for instead of going on with her buyings , they began whispering to one another .
Elton had just joined them , and his wife was exclaiming ,
Mrs . Weston ' s partiality for him is very great , and , as you may suppose , most gratifying to me .
You never wrote a truer line ."
Mr . Martin is a very respectable young man , but I cannot admit him to be Harriet ' s equal ; and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her .
" Oh !"
" Miss Smith !-- oh !-- I had not observed .-- You are extremely obliging -- and if I were not an old married man .-- But my dancing days are over , Mrs . Weston .
" Indeed you did .
And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her .
" I doubt its being very clever myself ," said Mr . Weston .
They continued together with unabated regard however , till the marriage of Miss Campbell , who by that chance , that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs , giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior , engaged the affections of Mr . Dixon , a young man , rich and agreeable , almost as soon as they were acquainted ; and was eligibly and happily settled , while Jane Fairfax had yet her bread to earn .
" Well , Miss Woodhouse ," said Harriet , when they had quitted the house , and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin ; " Well , Miss Woodhouse , ( with a gentle sigh ,) what do you think of her ?-- Is not she very charming ?"
" How is it possible ?"
Another view of man , my second brings , Behold him there , the monarch of the seas !
And to propose that she and I should unite to form a musical club !
" So do I ," said Mrs . Weston gently , " very much ."
You must remember it now ?"
I do not think it could disagree with you ."
But it is even so .
As she reflected more , she seemed but to feel it more .
my poor dear child , the truth is , that in London it is always a sickly season .
She had not advanced many yards from Mrs . Goddard ' s door , when she was met by Mr . Elton himself , evidently coming towards it , and as they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid -- of whom he , on the rumour of considerable illness , had been going to inquire , that he might carry some report of her to Hartfield -- they were overtaken by Mr . John Knightley returning from the daily visit to Donwell , with his two eldest boys , whose healthy , glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run , and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for .
Emma wished she had been alone with Mrs . Weston .
But this was not judged feasible .
He was invited on good faith .
Some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed , and others of the son and the uncle not letting him .
But you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own .
I must have given you up ."
She would catch a dreadful cold .
Emma , alone with her father , had half her attention wanted by him while he lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry -- and to marry strangers too -- and the other half she could give to her own view of the subject .
I am rather proud of little George .
_Now_ you have nothing to try for .
" You are a very warm friend to Mr . Martin ; but , as I said before , are unjust to Harriet .
Name your day , and I will come .
Elton , and Miss Hawkins !-- Good morning to you ."
" I have escaped ; and that I should escape , may be a matter of grateful wonder to you and myself .
It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned .
She opened the parlour door , and saw two gentlemen sitting with her father -- Mr . Weston and his son .
She , therefore , said no more for some time .
a man does not imagine any such thing .
" That will do ," said he , when it was finished , thinking aloud -- " you have sung quite enough for one evening -- now be quiet ."
Mrs . Bates , the widow of a former vicar of Highbury , was a very old lady , almost past every thing but tea and quadrille .
I certainly get better and better .-- Now for it ."
" Poor Mrs . Churchill !
I shall leave off while I am well ."
There was no time for farther remark or explanation .
" Four o ' clock !-- depend upon it he will be here by three ," was Mr . Weston ' s quick amendment ; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting .
" You had better order the carriage directly , my love ," said she ; " I dare say we shall be able to get along , if we set off directly ; and if we do come to any thing very bad , I can get out and walk .
Emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which Mr . Weston depended , and felt , that to be the favourite and intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes , was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity .
My dear Emma , suppose we all have a little gruel ."
The next remove was to the house ; they must all go in and eat ;-- and they were all seated and busy , and still Frank Churchill did not come .
" To be sure -- our discordancies must always arise from my being in the wrong ."
And Jane will have such another .
Every invitation was successful .
He had been at the pains of consulting Mr . Perry , the apothecary , on the subject .
Do you think I am right ?"
I want to have your opinion of her looks .
Would not Harriet be the very creature described ?
She must tell you herself what she is -- yet not by word , for never was there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her own merit .-- Since I began this letter , which will be longer than I foresaw , I have heard from her .-- She gives a good account of her own health ; but as she never complains , I dare not depend .
" Nothing can be actually settled yet , perhaps ," replied Emma , smiling --" but , excuse me , it must be thought of ."
He was wishing to confide in her -- perhaps to consult her ;-- cost her what it would , she would listen .
