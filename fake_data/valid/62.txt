There were Mr . and Mrs . Weston ; delighted to see her and receive her approbation , very busy and very happy in their different way ; she , in some little distress ; and he , finding every thing perfect .
Her father never went beyond the shrubbery , where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long walk , or his short , as the year varied ; and since Mrs . Weston ' s marriage her exercise had been too much confined .
A very proper compliment !-- and then follows the application , which I think , my dear Harriet , you cannot find much difficulty in comprehending .
Now , upon his father ' s marriage , it was very generally proposed , as a most proper attention , that the visit should take place .
" He will have every body ' s wishes for his happiness ."
There could be no doubt of his great pleasure in seeing her .
" Well , he is coming , you see ; good news , I think .
" I was very often influenced rightly by you -- oftener than I would own at the time .
Tea was carrying round , and Mr . Weston , having said all that he wanted , soon took the opportunity of walking away .
Some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence , with only one attempt on Emma ' s side to talk of the weather , but he made no answer .
" Mrs . Cole has servants to send .
no , upon my word I have not the smallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body .
That , you know , was so very .
I love to look at her ; and I will add this praise , that I do not think her personally vain .
" By all means .
thought Emma , " he would have done as much for Harriet ."
She is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom , with probably no settled provision at all , and certainly no respectable relations .
She gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence ; but was really obliged to put an end to it , and request him to place himself elsewhere .
I could have wished , however , as you know , that you had seen Mr . Wingfield before you left home ."
She soon resolved , equally as a duty and a pleasure , to employ half an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax .-- She ought to go -- and she was longing to see her ; the resemblance of their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill .
This is great news , indeed .
My dear Harriet , what do you mean ?
They were just approaching the house where lived Mrs . and Miss Bates .
" Well , sir ," cried Mr . Weston , " as I took Miss Taylor away , it is incumbent on me to supply her place , if I can ; and I will step to Mrs . Goddard in a moment , if you wish it ."
I assure you I am not at all pleased .
How trifling they make every thing else appear !-- I feel now as if I could think of nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day ; and yet , who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind ?"
John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection , and Isabella always thinks as he does ; except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children .
He paused -- and growing cooler in a moment , added , with only sarcastic dryness , " If Mr . Perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty , I should be as willing to prefer Cromer to South End as he could himself ."
Mrs . Weston would be at ease .
Were he ever able to get away , the day would be spent in coming and returning .
I can think of but one thing -- Who is in love with her ?
They are jealous even of his regard for his father .
Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax , escorted by the two gentlemen , walked into the room ; and Mrs . Elton seemed to think it as much her duty as Mrs . Weston ' s to receive them .
" I thought he meant to try his skill , by his manner of declining it yesterday ."
" Ah !
She was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other .
I believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing - room that we are expecting Frank .
Emma , this is your doing .
Let us make the best of it -- and , indeed , almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour .
A few awkward moments passed , and he sat down again ; and in a more determined manner said ,
" No -- I cannot call them gifts ; but they are things that I have valued very much ."
.
Mrs . Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note , or we should have been .-- But two such offers in one day !-- Never were such neighbours .
He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte , and turning to Emma , said ,
I told you that your suspicions would guide mine ."
" I cannot rate her beauty as you do ," said he ; " but she is a pretty little creature , and I am inclined to think very well of her disposition .
They were all disengaged and all happy .-- The preparatory interest of this dinner , however , was not yet over .
You will be adored in Highbury .
And now , let me talk to you of something else .
Mr . Knightley suspected in Frank Churchill the determination of catching her eye -- he seemed watching her intently -- in vain , however , if it were so -- Jane passed between them into the hall , and looked at neither .
Do not you see that , at this instant , the very passage of her own letter , which sent me the report , is passing under her eye -- that the whole blunder is spread before her -- that she can attend to nothing else , though pretending to listen to the others ?"
They seem not able to do any thing without him .--` Upon my word , Mr . E .,' I often say , ` rather you than I .-- I do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument , if I had half so many applicants .'
" Come ," said she , " I will tell you something , in return for what you have told me .
The last night ' s ball seemed lost in the gipsies .
I should not attempt it , if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the Highbury people , but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path .
She would not take a denial .
--" She believed he was reckoned a very fine young man ."
I am sure we do .
You are so kind !"
Do you know any family of that name ?"
Harriet , she found , had never in her life been within side the Vicarage , and her curiosity to see it was so extreme , that , considering exteriors and probabilities , Emma could only class it , as a proof of love , with Mr . Elton ' s seeing ready wit in her .
Elton ?"
" Some very fine morning , he , and Emma , and Harriet , could go very well ; and he could sit still with Mrs . Weston , while the dear girls walked about the gardens .
This , you know , speaks a great degree of weakness -- but now she is so impatient to be in town , that she means to sleep only two nights on the road .-- So Frank writes word .
Emma waited the result with impatience , but not without strong hopes .
you have found us out at last , have you , in our seclusion ?-- I was this moment telling Jane , I thought you would begin to be impatient for tidings of us ."
And she is a good - natured woman after all .
She had taken up the idea , she supposed , and made every thing bend to it .
They went in ; and while the sleek , well - tied parcels of " Men ' s Beavers " and " York Tan " were bringing down and displaying on the counter , he said --" But I beg your pardon , Miss Woodhouse , you were speaking to me , you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my _amor_ _patriae_ .
And , after proceeding a few steps , she added -- " I stopped you ungraciously , just now , Mr . Knightley , and , I am afraid , gave you pain .-- But if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend , or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation -- as a friend , indeed , you may command me .-- I will hear whatever you like .
My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings , Lords of the earth !
Then , he said , he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day ."
What nonsense one talks , Miss Woodhouse , when hard at work , if one talks at all ;-- your real workmen , I suppose , hold their tongues ; but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word -- Miss Fairfax said something about conjecturing .
She must not appear to think it a misfortune .-- With all the spirits she could command , she prepared him first for something strange , and then , in a few words , said , that if his consent and approbation could be obtained -- which , she trusted , would be attended with no difficulty , since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all -- she and Mr . Knightley meant to marry ; by which means Hartfield would receive the constant addition of that person ' s company whom she knew he loved , next to his daughters and Mrs . Weston , best in the world .
It was her own universal good - will and contented temper which worked such wonders .
The rest of the party were now returning , and all were soon collected .
The Eltons walked together ; Mr . Knightley took charge of Miss Bates and Jane ; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill .
" I hope she does .
But from one cause or another , I gave it up in disgust .
Donwell was famous for its strawberry - beds , which seemed a plea for the invitation : but no plea was necessary ; cabbage - beds would have been enough to tempt the lady , who only wanted to be going somewhere .
That is your date .
" So extremely like Maple Grove !
I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point .
I can see nothing at all extraordinary in him now .-- I do not care whether I meet him or not -- except that of the two I had rather not see him -- and indeed I would go any distance round to avoid him -- but I do not envy his wife in the least ; I neither admire her nor envy her , as I have done : she is very charming , I dare say , and all that , but I think her very ill - tempered and disagreeable -- I shall never forget her look the other night !-- However , I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , I wish her no evil .-- No , let them be ever so happy together , it will not give me another moment ' s pang : and to convince you that I have been speaking truth , I am now going to destroy -- what I ought to have destroyed long ago -- what I ought never to have kept -- I know that very well ( blushing as she spoke ).-- However , now I will destroy it all -- and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence , that you may see how rational I am grown .
Later in the morning , and just as the girls were going to separate in preparation for the regular four o ' clock dinner , the hero of this inimitable charade walked in again .
" I think , indeed ," said John Knightley pleasantly , " that Mr . Weston has some little claim .
What am I to do ?"
" No , no , you must not ; you shall not , indeed ."
" Ah !
dear ; I was so miserable !
It was all right , all open , all equal .
" And if I did , ( which , however , I am far from allowing ) I should not feel that I had done wrong .
It was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet ' s behalf , though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom ; for evil in that quarter was at hand .
A Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on that passage ."
I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point .
We must allow for the effect of shade , you know ."
There she was welcomed , with the utmost delight , by her father , who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage Lane -- turning a corner which he could never bear to think of -- and in strange hands -- a mere common coachman -- no James ; and there it seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well : for Mr . John Knightley , ashamed of his ill - humour , was now all kindness and attention ; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her father , as to seem -- if not quite ready to join him in a basin of gruel -- perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome ; and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party , except herself .-- But her mind had never been in such perturbation ; and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection .
I thought -- but I beg your pardon , perhaps I have been under a mistake .
Oh !
And Jane declares -- Well !--( as soon as she was within the door ) Well !
