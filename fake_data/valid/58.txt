Oh !
If I draw less , I shall read more ; if I give up music , I shall take to carpet - work .
He had long made up his mind to Jane Fairfax ' s going out as governess , and could talk of it cheerfully , but Mr . Knightley ' s going to London had been an unexpected blow .
Even pleasure , you know , is fatiguing -- and I cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it .
His son , too well bred to hear the hint , rose immediately also , saying ,
Such a very kind attention -- and so thoughtful an attention !-- the sort of thing that so few men would think of .
" Poor Mr . and Miss Woodhouse , if you please ; but I cannot possibly say ` poor Miss Taylor .'
Oh !
Of course I have not transcribed beyond the first eight lines ."
He was on the move immediately ; but coming back , said ,
He is half way to Windsor by this time ."
" I see how it is ," said she .
" You are so noble in your ideas !"
" Well , I cannot understand it ."
Mr . Elton ' s engagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting Mr . Martin .
I dare say we shall be all safe at Hartfield before midnight ."
She had hoped for an answer here -- for a few words to say that her conduct was at least intelligible ; but he was silent ; and , as far as she could judge , deep in thought .
I could do very well without it .
I do not pretend to Emma ' s genius for foretelling and guessing .
It is a great deal more natural than one could wish , that a young man , brought up by those who are proud , luxurious , and selfish , should be proud , luxurious , and selfish too .
I would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible ."
I always deserve the best treatment , because I never put up with any other ; and , therefore , you must give me a plain , direct answer .
I am sure there is nobody ' s praise that could give us so much pleasure as Miss Woodhouse ' s .
" You , sir , may say any thing ," cried Mr . Elton , " but I must confess that I regard it as a most happy thought , the placing of Miss Smith out of doors ; and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit !
I know you will soon call on her ; she is living in dread of the visit .
The bitter feelings occasioned by this speech , the many bitter feelings , made the utmost exertion necessary on Emma ' s side , to enable her to say on reply ,
Her situation should secure your compassion .
" If I had set my heart on Mr . Elton ' s marrying Harriet , it would have been very kind to open my eyes ; but at present I only want to keep Harriet to myself .
The possibility of the young man ' s coming to Mrs . Goddard ' s that morning , and meeting with Harriet and pleading his own cause , gave alarming ideas .
This is what we all feel .
And then , to prevent farther outrage and indignation , changed the subject directly .
She went on , however .
When Harriet had closed her evidence , she appealed to her dear Miss Woodhouse , to say whether she had not good ground for hope .
" Well ," said Mrs . Weston , smiling , " you give him credit for more simple , disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do ; for while Miss Bates was speaking , a suspicion darted into my head , and I have never been able to get it out again .
And though the consequent shock and alarm was very great and much more durable -- indeed I believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again -- yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable .
Not a creature knowing it but themselves -- neither the Campbells , nor her family , nor his .-- It is so wonderful , that though perfectly convinced of the fact , it is yet almost incredible to myself .
Mrs . Weston was exceedingly disappointed -- much more disappointed , in fact , than her husband , though her dependence on seeing the young man had been so much more sober : but a sanguine temper , though for ever expecting more good than occurs , does not always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression .
" It would be a crowd -- a sad crowd ; and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in ?"
Her situation should secure your compassion .
" I am not speaking of its prudence ; merely its probability ."
For his own sake , I would not have him do so mad a thing ."
The next remove was to the house ; they must all go in and eat ;-- and they were all seated and busy , and still Frank Churchill did not come .
" You like it , my Emma , as little as I feared .-- I wish our opinions were the same .
Mrs . Weston sees no objection to it , provided you are satisfied .
In the warmth of true contrition , she would call upon her the very next morning , and it should be the beginning , on her side , of a regular , equal , kindly intercourse .
.
" Oh !
She could never quit him ."
here ' s Miss Woodhouse .-- Dear Miss Woodhouse , how do you do ?-- Very well I thank you , quite well .
A little while ago , every letter to Isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties ; dinners at Mr . Cole ' s , or balls at the Crown .
said Emma , highly amused .--" Mr .
Mrs . Weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem .
She is a woman that one may , that one _must_ laugh at ; but that one would not wish to slight .
" Oh !
Now I cannot say , that I think you are any of you looking well at present ."
could not have supposed any thing !-- Such elegance and profusion !-- I have seen nothing like it since -- Well , where shall we sit ?
Emma ' s colour was heightened by this unjust praise ; and with a smile , and shake of the head , which spoke much , she looked at Mr .
she is a sweet creature !
She played and sang ;-- and drew in almost every style ; but steadiness had always been wanting ; and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad to command , and ought not to have failed of .
It is a most uncommon complexion , with her dark eye - lashes and hair -- a most distinguishing complexion !
They are very important -- and sorry I am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them .
Aye , I remember it all now ; all , except your saving this relic -- I knew nothing of that till this moment -- but the cutting the finger , and my recommending court - plaister , and saying I had none about me !-- Oh !
" Why , to be sure ," said Mr . Woodhouse --" yes , certainly -- I cannot deny that Mrs . Weston , poor Mrs . Weston , does come and see us pretty often -- but then -- she is always obliged to go away again ."
I could never hope to equal my own doings at Randalls .
I am extremely happy .
" Oh !
Quite thick shoes .
It was the very event to engage those who talk most , the young and the low ; and all the youth and servants in the place were soon in the happiness of frightful news .
" Thank you , dear Miss Woodhouse .
Jane Fairfax was an orphan , the only child of Mrs . Bates ' s youngest daughter .
Your views for Harriet are best known to yourself ; but as you make no secret of your love of match - making , it is fair to suppose that views , and plans , and projects you have ;-- and as a friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton is the man , I think it will be all labour in vain ."
Mr . Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury , and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed , though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life .
Miss Churchill , however , being of age , and with the full command of her fortune -- though her fortune bore no proportion to the family - estate -- was not to be dissuaded from the marriage , and it took place , to the infinite mortification of Mr . and Mrs . Churchill , who threw her off with due decorum .
" Oh !
She exerted herself , and did try to make her comfortable , by considering all that had passed as a mere trifle , and quite unworthy of being dwelt on ,
I never heard of such a thing .
" Oh !
CHAPTER XVI
The child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer than herself ; and Mrs . Weston ' s heart and time would be occupied by it .
Let us be discreet -- quite on our good behaviour .-- Hush !-- You remember those lines -- I forget the poem at this moment :
The gruel came and supplied a great deal to be said -- much praise and many comments -- undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution , and pretty severe Philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with tolerable ;-- but , unfortunately , among the failures which the daughter had to instance , the most recent , and therefore most prominent , was in her own cook at South End , a young woman hired for the time , who never had been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel , thin , but not too thin .
For Mrs . Weston there was nothing to be done ; for Harriet every thing .
They are known to no human being , I guess , but herself .
My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well .
Quite thick shoes .
A little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear .
The idea of her being indebted to Mrs . Elton for what was called an _introduction_ -- of her going into public under the auspices of a friend of Mrs . Elton ' s -- probably some vulgar , dashing widow , who , with the help of a boarder , just made a shift to live !-- The dignity of Miss Woodhouse , of Hartfield , was sunk indeed !
I do not say when , but perhaps you may guess where ;-- in the building in which N . takes M . for better , for worse ."
CHAPTER XVIII
Emma was most happy to be called to such a council ; and her father , engaging to think it all over while she was gone , the two young people set off together without delay for the Crown .
She was quite one of her worthies -- the most amiable , affable , delightful woman -- just as accomplished and condescending as Mrs . Elton meant to be considered .
Her regard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him , and her regrets kept alive , and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss Hawkins ' s happiness , and continual observation of , how much he seemed attached !-- his air as he walked by the house -- the very sitting of his hat , being all in proof of how much he was in love !
" Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother and sister are here .
CHAPTER VIII
" Nonsense !
When you are tired of eating strawberries in the garden , there shall be cold meat in the house ."
A large party secures its own amusement .
Mr . Frank Churchill , indeed !
Mr . Knightley , a sensible man about seven or eight - and - thirty , was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family , but particularly connected with it , as the elder brother of Isabella ' s husband .
She was quick in feeling the little injuries to Isabella , which Isabella never felt herself .
