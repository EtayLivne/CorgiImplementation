" Miss Fairfax , I suppose , though you were not aware of it , had been making up her mind the whole day ?"
His extreme attention to my mother -- wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew , that she might hear the better , for my mother is a little deaf , you know -- it is not much , but she does not hear quite quick .
my dear sir , as my mother says , our friends are only too good to us .
Say ` No ,' if it is to be said ."
She felt it at her heart .
But here there was nothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future .
She was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms , at the poor attempt at rout - cakes , and there being no ice in the Highbury card - parties .
Well , I shall bring Jane with me -- Jane and her aunt .-- The rest I leave to you .
Your dear mother was so clever at all those things !
Emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face ; and while paying her own compliments to Mrs . Bates , and appearing to attend to the good old lady ' s replies , she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax , and return it into the purple and gold reticule by her side , saying , with significant nods ,
You are very fond of bending little minds ; but where little minds belong to rich people in authority , I think they have a knack of swelling out , till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones .
Campbell ."
He is generally thought a fine young man , but do not expect a prodigy .
Mr . Elton was speaking with animation , Harriet listening with a very pleased attention ; and Emma , having sent the child on , was beginning to think how she might draw back a little more , when they both looked around , and she was obliged to join them .
" Oh !"
Elton ."
Within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge - ware box , which Harriet opened : it was well lined with the softest cotton ; but , excepting the cotton , Emma saw only a small piece of court - plaister .
We must remember to let James know that the carriage will be wanted on Tuesday .
" I should not have thought it possible ," she began , " that you could have misunderstood me !
poor woman , who would have thought it !"
But Emma still shook her head in steady scepticism .
The advantage of the match I felt to be all on her side ; and had not the smallest doubt ( nor have I now ) that there would be a general cry - out upon her extreme good luck .
The invitation was refused , and by a verbal message .
-- Ford ' s was the principal woollen - draper , linen - draper , and haberdasher ' s shop united ; the shop first in size and fashion in the place .--" And so , there she had set , without an idea of any thing in the world , full ten minutes , perhaps -- when , all of a sudden , who should come in -- to be sure it was so very odd !-- but they always dealt at Ford ' s -- who should come in , but Elizabeth Martin and her brother !-- Dear Miss Woodhouse !
Miss Woodhouse , what do you think has happened !"
" But you need not imagine Mr . Weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up Henry or John .
With mixed feelings , she seated herself at a little distance from the numbers round the instrument , to listen .
What has it been but a system of hypocrisy and deceit ,-- espionage , and treachery ?-- To come among us with professions of openness and simplicity ; and such a league in secret to judge us all !-- Here have we been , the whole winter and spring , completely duped , fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and honour , with two people in the midst of us who may have been carrying round , comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both to hear .-- They must take the consequence , if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable !"
He promised to join me here , and pay his respects to you ."
A letter arrived from Mr . Churchill to urge his nephew ' s instant return .
Do not pity me till I saw her wan , sick looks .-- I reached Highbury at the time of day when , from my knowledge of their late breakfast hour , I was certain of a good chance of finding her alone .-- I was not disappointed ; and at last I was not disappointed either in the object of my journey .
-- Even Mr . Weston shook his head , and looked solemn , and said , " Ah !
" Oh !
she cried .--" And such weather for exploring !-- These delays and disappointments are quite odious .
I think it would be much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer , and take their tea with us -- take us in their afternoon walk ; which they might do , as our hours are so reasonable , and yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening .
It had not been forgotten before , but it had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day .
" How do you like Mrs .
The yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom I feel I can have nothing to do .
His letters disgust me ."
As a magistrate , he had generally some point of law to consult John about , or , at least , some curious anecdote to give ; and as a farmer , as keeping in hand the home - farm at Donwell , he had to tell what every field was to bear next year , and to give all such local information as could not fail of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his life , and whose attachments were strong .
" Indeed !-- that must be a very great pleasure ."
Where the wound had been given , there must the cure be found if anywhere ; and Emma felt that , till she saw her in the way of cure , there could be no true peace for herself .
" I wish you may not get into a scrape , Harriet , whenever he does marry ;-- I mean , as to being acquainted with his wife -- for though his sisters , from a superior education , are not to be altogether objected to , it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice .
Her father -- and Harriet .
" She loves him then excessively , I suppose .
Miss Bates said a great deal ; Mrs . Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse ' s presiding ; Mr . Knightley ' s answer was the most distinct .
She did not really like her .
Mrs . Weston , you would be quite laid up ; do not let them talk of such a wild thing .
" No , no ," said she , " you are quite unreasonable .
" There does , indeed , seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present ," said Mrs . Weston , " as can well be ; and while she is so happy at Hartfield , I cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor Mr . Woodhouse ' s account .
Mr . Elton cared little about it , compared with his wife ; he only hoped " the young lady ' s pride would now be contented ;" and supposed " she had always meant to catch Knightley if she could ;" and , on the point of living at Hartfield , could daringly exclaim , " Rather he than I !"
But in every respect , as she saw more of her , she approved her , and was confirmed in all her kind designs .
Emma watched the entree of her own particular little friend ; and if she could not exult in her dignity and grace , she could not only love the blooming sweetness and the artless manner , but could most heartily rejoice in that light , cheerful , unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many alleviations of pleasure , in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection .
Mrs . Martin had told her one day ( and there was a blush as she said it ,) that it was impossible for any body to be a better son , and therefore she was sure , whenever he married , he would make a good husband .
I do admire your patriotism .
I cannot help suspecting him .
She held the parcel towards her , and Emma read the words _Most_ _precious_ _treasures_ on the top .
" You are very kind , but I know what my manners were to you .-- So cold and artificial !-- I had always a part to act .-- It was a life of deceit !-- I know that I must have disgusted you ."
the coldness of a Jane Fairfax !-- Harriet is worth a hundred such -- And for a wife -- a sensible man ' s wife -- it is invaluable .
Emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech , from his wife .
" Miss Fairfax , I suppose , though you were not aware of it , had been making up her mind the whole day ?"
said Emma in a whisper .
And I need not bring the whole family , you know ."
Now , as her objection was nothing but her very great dislike of Mrs . Elton , of which Mr . Weston must already be perfectly aware , it was not worth bringing forward again :-- it could not be done without a reproof to him , which would be giving pain to his wife ; and she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she would have done a great deal to avoid ; an arrangement which would probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of Mrs . Elton ' s party !
He was not hungry ; it would only make him hotter ."
" And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking ?"
Believe me , sir , I am far , very far , from gratified in being the object of such professions ."
They must both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and concealment ."
" Both sir !
The scene enlarged ; two persons appeared ; Mrs . Weston and her son - in - law ; they were walking into Highbury ;-- to Hartfield of course .
The scene enlarged ; two persons appeared ; Mrs . Weston and her son - in - law ; they were walking into Highbury ;-- to Hartfield of course .
Mrs . Elton , very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her by such a hope , smiled most graciously .
He looked at her , as if wanting to read her thoughts .
She was obliged , in spite of her previous determination to the contrary , to do it all the justice that Mrs . Weston foretold .
yes , very .
" With a great deal of pleasure , sir , at any time ," said Mr . Knightley , laughing , " and I agree with you entirely , that it will be a much better thing .
Could the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance !-- But of that , unfortunately , there could be no chance .
He had not time to enter into much explanation .
He has too much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion .
In he walked , the first and the handsomest ; and after paying his compliments en passant to Miss Bates and her niece , made his way directly to the opposite side of the circle , where sat Miss Woodhouse ; and till he could find a seat by her , would not sit at all .
They met with the utmost friendliness .
It was not thrown away on her , she bounded higher than ever , flew farther down the middle , and was in a continual course of smiles .
And then fly off , through half a sentence , to her mother ' s old petticoat .
Are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr . Martin and Harriet now are ?"
Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her so happily married ."
She might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison , while a sharer of his conversation with her friend ; and from the best , the purest of motives , might now be denying herself this visit to Ireland , and resolving to divide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty .
Nothing wanting .
very delightful indeed ; I can say nothing less , for I suppose Miss Woodhouse and Mr . Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that passes .
and his wife ' s persuading him to it , out of care for his health -- just what will happen , I have no doubt , some time or other ; only a little premature .
Emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment .
But " she could never get acquainted with her : she did not know how it was , but there was such coldness and reserve -- such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not -- and then , her aunt was such an eternal talker !-- and she was made such a fuss with by every body !-- and it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate -- because their ages were the same , every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other ."
" You are right .
He looked around , as if to see that no one were near , and then said ,
She would catch a dreadful cold .
" But why should you be sorry , sir ?-- I assure you , it did the children a great deal of good ."
Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her companions at Mrs . Goddard ' s ; Mr . Elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school ; and it must be at Hartfield only that she could have any chance of hearing him spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth .
Angry as she was , the thought of the moment made her resolve to restrain herself when she did speak .
She was wanting to see him again , and especially to see him in company with Mrs . Weston , upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him was to depend .
In half an hour the arrowroot was returned , with a thousand thanks from Miss Bates , but " dear Jane would not be satisfied without its being sent back ; it was a thing she could not take -- and , moreover , she insisted on her saying , that she was not at all in want of any thing ."
After a few minutes of entire silence between them , John Knightley began with --
