As I am happily quite an altered creature in _one_ _respect_ , it is very fit that you should have the satisfaction of knowing it .
We all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou , the plainest spoken amongst us ; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other -- a something more early implanted .
" I know there is such an idea with many people , but indeed it is quite a mistake , sir .-- We all had our health perfectly well there , never found the least inconvenience from the mud ; and Mr . Wingfield says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy ; and I am sure he may be depended on , for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air , and his own brother and family have been there repeatedly ."
Emma knew that she had , but would not own it ; and Mr . Elton warmly added ,
It was a concern which brought just employment enough .
" Be satisfied ," said he , " I will not raise any outcry .
A very proper compliment !-- and then follows the application , which I think , my dear Harriet , you cannot find much difficulty in comprehending .
The information was , as you state , that he was going to be married to a Miss Hawkins .
But poor Harriet could not follow .
" Oh !
Mr . Woodhouse saw the letter , and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life ."
What totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house from what she had brought out !-- she had then been only daring to hope for a little respite of suffering ;-- she was now in an exquisite flutter of happiness , and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away .
Mrs . Weston and Emma were sitting together on a sofa .
The weather added what it could of gloom .
" What !"
She had heard , as soon as she got back to Mrs . Goddard ' s , that Mr . Martin had been there an hour before , and finding she was not at home , nor particularly expected , had left a little parcel for her from one of his sisters , and gone away ; and on opening this parcel , she had actually found , besides the two songs which she had lent Elizabeth to copy , a letter to herself ; and this letter was from him , from Mr . Martin , and contained a direct proposal of marriage .
Mr . Knightley , who , for some reason best known to himself , had certainly taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill , was only growing to dislike him more .
A situation such as you deserve , and your friends would require for you , is no everyday occurrence , is not obtained at a moment ' s notice ; indeed , indeed , we must begin inquiring directly ."
" You have , I believe , and know the whole ."
She asked after their mutual friends ; they were all well .-- When had he left them ?-- Only that morning .
You and I must positively exert our authority ."
" That I am sure you would .
The corner of the sofa is very good .
CHAPTER I
She was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy wife together , without feeling uncomfortable .
I had quite determined to go away again ."
You and Mr . Elton are by situation called together ; you belong to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes .
You will excuse her not coming to you -- she is not able -- she is gone into her own room -- I want her to lie down upon the bed .
Dixon ?"
Surry is full of beauties ."
CHARADE .
He reads the Agricultural Reports , and some other books that lay in one of the window seats -- but he reads all _them_ to himself .
That was what happened before tea .
I think they judge wisely .
There is such perfect good - temper and good - will in Mr . Elton as one cannot but value ."
For half an hour Mr . Weston was surprized and sorry ; but then he began to perceive that Frank ' s coming two or three months later would be a much better plan ; better time of year ; better weather ; and that he would be able , without any doubt , to stay considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner .
Do help me .
The good sense of Colonel and Mrs . Campbell could not oppose such a resolution , though their feelings did .
It was better to pay my visit , then "--
Gone to Mr . Woodhouse ' s .
He rode down for a couple of hours ; he could not yet do more ; but as he came from Randalls immediately to Hartfield , she could then exercise all her quick observation , and speedily determine how he was influenced , and how she must act .
Every body was punctual , every body in their best looks : not a tear , and hardly a long face to be seen .
But stranger things have happened ; and when we cease to care for each other as we do now , it will be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested friendship which I can already look forward to with pleasure ."
He is just as superior as ever ;-- but being married , you know , it is quite a different thing .
Was not she the whole day with you ?"
My dear Emma , your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came to the point ."
And he smiled with such seeming pleasure at the conviction , that she must proceed another step .
-- but checking himself --" No , no , I understand you -- forgive me -- I am pleased that you can say even so much .-- He is no object of regret , indeed !
Better than nearer !
The good sense of Colonel and Mrs . Campbell could not oppose such a resolution , though their feelings did .
Emma scarcely heard what was said .-- Her mind was divided between two ideas -- her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax ; and poor Harriet ;-- and for some time she could only exclaim , and require confirmation , repeated confirmation .
The backgammon - table was placed ; but a visitor immediately afterwards walked in and made it unnecessary .
" Who could have thought it ?
Emma could not resist .
Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged -- appetite quite gone -- and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms , nothing touching the pulmonary complaint , which was the standing apprehension of the family , Mr . Perry was uneasy about her .
There cannot be two opinions about _him_ .
The friends from whom she had just parted , though very good sort of people , must be doing her harm .
He seemed hardly to hear her ; he was thoughtful -- and in a manner which shewed him not pleased , soon afterwards said ,
" No , not at Randalls ; I have not been near Randalls ," when the door was thrown open , and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room .
On his side were the inquiries ,--" Was she a horsewoman ?-- Pleasant rides ?-- Pleasant walks ?-- Had they a large neighbourhood ?-- Highbury , perhaps , afforded society enough ?-- There were several very pretty houses in and about it .-- Balls -- had they balls ?-- Was it a musical society ?"
It was the scrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet ' s account , that gave the deepest hue to his offence .-- Poor Harriet !
He is a most charming young man .
Mr . Knightley does nothing mysteriously ."
And what inclines one less to bear , she has no fair pretence of family or blood .
" She meant to be impertinently curious , just as such an Anne Cox should be ."
June will soon be here ."
He did not know what they had best do .
Yes , next week .
She was quite concerned and ashamed , and resolved to do such things no more .
My perpetual influence could not begin earlier , or you would not have been so much out of humour before ."
It did , however .-- Her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so sudden a journey , and his fears that Mr . Elton might never get safely to the end of it , and saw nothing extraordinary in his language .
" So much the better -- or so much the worse :-- I do not know which .
The Churchills might not have a word to say in return ; but then , you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through .
But , now that she has written her letters , she says she shall soon be well .
I would be understood to mean , that it can be only weak , irresolute characters , ( whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance ,) who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience , an oppression for ever ."
I was once very near -- and I wish I had -- it would have been better .
Dear Harriet !-- I would not change you for the clearest - headed , longest - sighted , best - judging female breathing .
She must know as well as her father , how acceptable an instrument would be ; and perhaps the mode of it , the mystery , the surprize , is more like a young woman ' s scheme than an elderly man ' s .
" This will not be your only visit to Randalls ."
He did so , but very soon stopt again to say , " the pianoforte !
But poor Harriet could not follow .
-- She was afraid she had done her nothing but disservice .-- It was true that she had not to charge herself , in this instance as in the former , with being the sole and original author of the mischief ; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered Harriet ' s imagination ; for Harriet had acknowledged her admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she had ever given her a hint on the subject ; but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed .
He was too angry to say another word ; her manner too decided to invite supplication ; and in this state of swelling resentment , and mutually deep mortification , they had to continue together a few minutes longer , for the fears of Mr . Woodhouse had confined them to a foot - pace .
It was the scrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet ' s account , that gave the deepest hue to his offence .-- Poor Harriet !
She must allow him to be still frequently coming to look ; any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover ; and he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil , to jump up and see the progress , and be charmed .-- There was no being displeased with such an encourager , for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible .
This is delightful , is not it ?-- Where ' s dear Mr .
She was pondering , in the meanwhile , upon the possibility , without seeming very rude , of making her escape from Jane Fairfax ' s letter , and had almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse , when Miss Bates turned to her again and seized her attention .
I absolutely cannot do without music .
Miss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door ; and her visitors walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to , pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good - will .
Her parting look was grateful -- and her parting words , " Oh !
A likeness pleases every body ; and Miss Woodhouse ' s performances must be capital .
This Emma felt was aimed at her ; and it made her quite angry .
With him it was most unnatural .
" Ah !
When one is in great pain , you know one cannot feel any blessing quite as it may deserve .
She could not be complying , she dreaded being quarrelsome ; her heroism reached only to silence .
In respectability of character , there can be no doubt that they are .
Emma returned all her attention to her father , saying in secret --
Quite a humourist .
She could not be too soon alarmed , nor send for Perry too often .
