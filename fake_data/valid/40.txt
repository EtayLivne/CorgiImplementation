She is a woman that one may , that one _must_ laugh at ; but that one would not wish to slight .
That is , _I_ always had a strong persuasion he would be here again soon , I was sure something favourable would turn up -- but nobody believed me .
I hope I know better now , than to care for Mr . Martin , or to be suspected of it ."
Short letters from Frank were received at Randalls , communicating all that was immediately important of their state and plans .
" It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined !
My blindness to what was going on , led me to act by them in a way that I must always be ashamed of , and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures , but I have no other reason to regret that I was not in the secret earlier ."
In spite of all her faults , she knew she was dear to him ; might she not say , very dear ?-- When the suggestions of hope , however , which must follow here , presented themselves , she could not presume to indulge them .
" But , my dear child , the time is drawing near ; here is April , and June , or say even July , is very near , with such business to accomplish before us .
what do you mean ?-- Mistake you !-- Am I to suppose then ?--"
You are always with me ."
The appearance of the little sitting - room as they entered , was tranquillity itself ; Mrs . Bates , deprived of her usual employment , slumbering on one side of the fire , Frank Churchill , at a table near her , most deedily occupied about her spectacles , and Jane Fairfax , standing with her back to them , intent on her pianoforte .
" Aye , we men are sad fellows .
I had not thought of it before , but that is the best way .
He saw that Emma had soon made it out , and found it highly entertaining , though it was something which she judged it proper to appear to censure ; for she said , " Nonsense !
Do not you remember what Mr . Perry said , so many years ago , when I had the measles ?
It was enough for her to feel .
Absolute neglect of the mother and sisters , when invited to come , would be ingratitude .
Emma , on reaching home , called the housekeeper directly , to an examination of her stores ; and some arrowroot of very superior quality was speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note .
Mr . John Knightley was a tall , gentleman - like , and very clever man ; rising in his profession , domestic , and respectable in his private character ; but with reserved manners which prevented his being generally pleasing ; and capable of being sometimes out of humour .
I hope it does him some service with you ."
You will see her to advantage ; see her and hear her -- no , I am afraid you will not hear her at all , for she has an aunt who never holds her tongue ."
Her situation should secure your compassion .
" If it were admissible to contradict a lady ," said the gallant Mr . Elton --
Her own conduct , as well as her own heart , was before her in the same few minutes .
There he had not always the patience that could have been wished .
convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about Hartfield .
" But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax !"
" You are very right ; it has been thought of .
But ah !
The youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy , and of powerful operation ; and if the distress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed , they will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope .
It used to stand here .
The speech was more to Emma than to Harriet , which Emma could understand .
They will be so very happy to see you ."
" Very ."
If Emma had still , at intervals , an anxious feeling for Harriet , a momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her attachment to Mr . Knightley , and really able to accept another man from unbiased inclination , it was not long that she had to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty .
Her sensibilities , I suspect , are strong -- and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance , patience , self - controul ; but it wants openness .
They must both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and concealment ."
" I hope Mrs . Bates and Miss Fairfax are --"
" I should say so , but that I suppose there may be a hundred different ways of being in love .
Her father was growing nervous , and could not understand _her_ .
I am delighted to find that you can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander -- but it will not do -- very sorry to check you in your first essay -- but indeed it will not do .
" The clerks grow expert from habit .-- They must begin with some quickness of sight and hand , and exercise improves them .
" I must spend some time with them ; I am sure they will want it ;-- afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself .
The evening of this day was very long , and melancholy , at Hartfield .
It is too unlikely , for me to believe it without proof ."
Things did not seem -- that is , there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some .-- So it appeared to me at least , but I might be mistaken .
" Oh yes !-- there is a great difference .
At last Jane began , and though the first bars were feebly given , the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to .
" Nothing at all .
you will never guess .
I should be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain .
And I see very few pearls in the room except mine .-- So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer , I understand .-- We shall see if our styles suit .-- A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill .
Go , and interfere .
Mr . Elton must now be left to himself .
I never hear better sense from any one than Robert Martin .
This was Mr . Elton !
Though her nephew had had no particular reason to hasten back on her account , she had not lived above six - and - thirty hours after his return .
" Yes -- rather -- I have been thinking of it some little time ."
Did not keep the horses a moment .
Mrs . Weston informed her that she was going to call on the Bateses , in order to hear the new instrument .
It was horrible to Emma to think how it must sink him in the general opinion , to foresee the smiles , the sneers , the merriment it would prompt at his expense ; the mortification and disdain of his brother , the thousand inconveniences to himself .-- Could it be ?-- No ; it was impossible .
What is passable in youth is detestable in later age .
Mr . Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit , that in spite of the increasing coldness , he seemed to have no idea of shrinking from it , and set forward at last most punctually with his eldest daughter in his own carriage , with less apparent consciousness of the weather than either of the others ; too full of the wonder of his own going , and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it was cold , and too well wrapt up to feel it .
Knightley .-- They had determined that their marriage ought to be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield , to allow them the fortnight ' s absence in a tour to the seaside , which was the plan .-- John and Isabella , and every other friend , were agreed in approving it .
Ten couple , in either of the Randalls rooms , would have been insufferable !-- Dreadful !-- I felt how right you were the whole time , but was too anxious for securing _any_ _thing_ to like to yield .
Her visit to Abbey - Mill , this summer , seems to have done his business .
"` Smallridge !'
" So prettily done !
I shall have no difficulty , I suppose , in finding the house ; though Fairfax , I believe , is not the proper name -- I should rather say Barnes , or Bates .
I was glad you made her play so much , for having no instrument at her grandmother ' s , it must have been a real indulgence ."
The very day of Mr . Elton ' s going to London produced a fresh occasion for Emma ' s services towards her friend .
His extreme attention to my mother -- wanting her to sit in the vicarage pew , that she might hear the better , for my mother is a little deaf , you know -- it is not much , but she does not hear quite quick .
It is only by seeing women in their own homes , among their own set , just as they always are , that you can form any just judgment .
I have heard him say that he could listen to her for ever .
" What an amiable creature I was !-- No wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance ."
No doubt it had been from jealousy .-- In Jane ' s eyes she had been a rival ; and well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed .
for I know gentlemen do not like morning visits , and Mr . Elton ' s time is so engaged ."
This is just what Perry said .
( looking round with the most good - humoured dependence on every body ' s assent )-- Do not you all think I shall ?"
Mrs . Weston informed her that she was going to call on the Bateses , in order to hear the new instrument .
The pain of being obliged to practise concealment towards him , was very little inferior to the pain of having made Harriet unhappy .
She felt for Harriet , with pain and with contrition ; but no flight of generosity run mad , opposing all that could be probable or reasonable , entered her brain .
" Harriet , I will only venture to declare , that Mr . Knightley is the last man in the world , who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does ."
Let me recommend Bath to you .
" Oh !
While they are with us , we shall explore a great deal , I dare say .
" He trifles here ," said he , " as to the temptation .
Miss Campbell always was absolutely plain -- but extremely elegant and amiable ."
I do not consider myself at all a fortunate person ."
" Excuse me , ma ' am , but this is by no means my intention ; I make no inquiry myself , and should be sorry to have any made by my friends .
Mrs . Churchill , after being disliked at least twenty - five years , was now spoken of with compassionate allowances .
" I do not understand what you mean by ` success ,'" said Mr . Knightley .
Depend upon it , we shall soon hear that it is a present from Mr . and Mrs .
Perry says that colds have been very general , but not so heavy as he has very often known them in November .
Till they all come in I shall not be missed ; and when they do , will you have the goodness to say that I am gone ?"
" So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young -- he wondered he could not remember them !
I have no fears at all for myself ; and I should have no scruples of staying as late as Mrs . Weston , but on your account .
" Well ," said Emma , willing to let it pass --" you want to hear about the wedding ; and I shall be happy to tell you , for we all behaved charmingly .
