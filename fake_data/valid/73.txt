The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here , and stand very much in the same way -- just across the lawn ; and I had a glimpse of a fine large tree , with a bench round it , which put me so exactly in mind !
The thing is determined , that is ( laughing affectedly ) as far as I can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master .
" But why should you be sorry , sir ?-- I assure you , it did the children a great deal of good ."
As to any thing superior for you , I suppose she is quite in the dark .
But with all the hopes of cheerfulness , and all the present comfort of delay , there was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with Harriet , as made it impossible for Emma to be ever perfectly at ease .
He is not a gallant man , but he is a very humane one ; and this , considering Jane Fairfax ' s ill - health , would appear a case of humanity to him ;-- and for an act of unostentatious kindness , there is nobody whom I would fix on more than on Mr . Knightley .
" Not quite ," returned Emma , with forced calmness , " for all that you then said , appeared to me to relate to a different person .
She is not the superior young woman which Emma ' s friend ought to be .
Time , however , she thought , would tell him that they ought to be friends again .
It will be felt so great an attention !
Ah !
Mr . Martin is now awkward and abrupt ; what will he be at Mr . Weston ' s time of life ?"
Dancing with open windows !-- I am sure , neither your father nor Mrs . Weston ( poor Miss Taylor that was ) would suffer it ."
sir -- but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a window - curtain , and throw up a sash , without its being suspected .
It was rather too late in the day to set about being simple - minded and ignorant ; but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of being humble and discreet , and repressing imagination all the rest of her life .
Proportions , fore - shortening .-- Oh no !
You , ( to Emma ), I am certain , will never guess .-- I will tell you .-- M .
And yet it was far , very far , from impossible .-- Was it a new circumstance for a man of first - rate abilities to be captivated by very inferior powers ?
And as for Harriet , I will venture to say that _she_ cannot gain by the acquaintance .
The ground covered with snow , and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw , which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise , every morning beginning in rain or snow , and every evening setting in to freeze , she was for many days a most honourable prisoner .
I do not wonder at you .
Mr . Suckling , who has been eleven years a resident at Maple Grove , and whose father had it before him -- I believe , at least -- I am almost sure that old Mr . Suckling had completed the purchase before his death ."
" Perry !"
Well , ( returning to the room ,) I have not been able to succeed .
I assure you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in private life ."
--
Mr . Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick leather gaiters , and either the exertion of getting them together , or some other cause , brought the colour into his face , as he answered ,
" Yes --( rather hesitatingly )-- I believe I do ."
After an interval of some minutes , however , he began with ,
Harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude .
All looked up to them .
What were nine miles to a young man ?-- An hour ' s ride .
" Handsome !
Mr . Weston , always alert when business was to be done , and as incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable , as of foreseeing any that was doubtful , said , " It was time to go ;" and the young man , though he might and did sigh , could not but agree , to take leave .
" I believe I have been very rude ; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair in so odd a way -- so very odd a way -- that I cannot keep my eyes from her .
Emma could not think it too soon ; for with all his good and agreeable qualities , there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to laugh .
I am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head .
the pains I have been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views !
" Yes -- what should hurt me ?-- I walk fast .
You divert me against my conscience .
I am thwarted in every thing material .
I saw Jane Fairfax and conversed with her , with admiration and pleasure always -- but with no thought beyond ."
I dared not address her openly ; my difficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well known to require definition ; and I was fortunate enough to prevail , before we parted at Weymouth , and to induce the most upright female mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement .-- Had she refused , I should have gone mad .-- But you will be ready to say , what was your hope in doing this ?-- What did you look forward to ?-- To any thing , every thing -- to time , chance , circumstance , slow effects , sudden bursts , perseverance and weariness , health and sickness .
Better be without sense , than misapply it as you do ."
How the delicacy , the discretion of his favourite could have been so lain asleep !
A very friendly shake of the hand , a very earnest " Good - bye ," closed the speech , and the door had soon shut out Frank Churchill .
It was adventuring too far , assuming too much , making light of what ought to be serious , a trick of what ought to be simple .
Not to wait upon a bride is very remiss .
If you prefer Mr . Martin to every other person ; if you think him the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with , why should you hesitate ?
" I told you yesterday ," cried Mr . Weston with exultation , " I told you all that he would be here before the time named .
She had no visible friends but what had been acquired at Highbury , and was now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her .
It was the delay of a great deal of pleasure and parade .
" Yes , and what you told me on that head , confirmed an idea which I had entertained before .-- I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either Mr . Dixon or Miss Fairfax , but I cannot help suspecting either that , after making his proposals to her friend , he had the misfortune to fall in love with _her_ , or that he became conscious of a little attachment on her side .
But hardly had she so spoken , when she found her brother was civilly offering a seat in his carriage , if the weather were Mr . Elton ' s only objection , and Mr . Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction .
" Why , to own the truth , I am afraid you are rather thrown away , and that with every disposition to bear , there will be nothing to be borne .
How little did I think !-- The two Abbots and I ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by , and Miss Nash came and scolded us away , and staid to look through herself ; however , she called me back presently , and let me look too , which was very good - natured .
He could now , without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise , without a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest , give way to all his natural kind - hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after Mr . Frank Churchill ' s accommodation on his journey , through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road , and express very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold -- which , however , he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till after another night .
From Monday next to Saturday , I assure you we have not a disengaged day !-- A woman with fewer resources than I have , need not have been at a loss ."
Mr . Elton ' s situation was most suitable , quite the gentleman himself , and without low connexions ; at the same time , not of any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet .
" And when she had come away , Mrs . Martin was so very kind as to send Mrs . Goddard a beautiful goose -- the finest goose Mrs . Goddard had ever seen .
The Coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into any great family .
" I cannot agree with you .
She hardly knew yet what Mr . Knightley would ask ; but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution of never quitting her father .-- She even wept over the idea of it , as a sin of thought .
Dining once with the Coles -- and having a ball talked of , which never took place .
And all the grandeur of the connexion seemed dependent on the elder sister , who was _very_ _well_ _married_ , to a gentleman in a _great_ _way_ , near Bristol , who kept two carriages !
Serious she was , very serious in her thankfulness , and in her resolutions ; and yet there was no preventing a laugh , sometimes in the very midst of them .
" No -- he should not eat .
Her Bath habits made evening - parties perfectly natural to her , and Maple Grove had given her a taste for dinners .
I thought -- but I beg your pardon , perhaps I have been under a mistake .
But she had not been there two minutes when she found that Harriet ' s habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too , and that , in short , they would both be soon after her .
I will send you some more , before they get good for nothing .'
Somebody said that _Miss_ Gilbert was expected at her brother ' s , and must be invited with the rest .
I have often known it done myself ."
She came solitarily down the gravel walk -- a Miss Martin just appearing at the door , and parting with her seemingly with ceremonious civility .
How is she to - day ?
The word was _blunder_ ; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it , there was a blush on Jane ' s cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible .
" It will not do ," whispered Frank to Emma ; " they are most of them affronted .
Frank was standing by her , but not steadily ; there was a restlessness , which shewed a mind not at ease .
Look !
Mrs . Weston , your argument weighs most with me .
" Poor Mr . and Miss Woodhouse , if you please ; but I cannot possibly say ` poor Miss Taylor .'
" You have , I believe , and know the whole ."
The subject followed ; it was in plain , unaffected , gentlemanlike English , such as Mr . Knightley used even to the woman he was in love with , how to be able to ask her to marry him , without attacking the happiness of her father .
" You are sick of prosperity and indulgence .
At last Emma attacked her on another ground .
" Why do you smile ?"
" Yes , you were very cross ; and I do not know what about , except that you were too late for the best strawberries .
What is before me , I see .
I believe he is one of the very best - tempered men that ever existed .
It was accepted ; and from that period Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell ' s family , and had lived with them entirely , only visiting her grandmother from time to time .
Neither Mr . Suckling nor me had ever any patience with them ; and we used sometimes to say very cutting things !
But there is nobody hereabouts to attach her ; and she goes so seldom from home ."
Have patience with me , I shall soon have done .-- She closed with this offer , resolving to break with me entirely , and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again .-- _She_ _felt_ _the_ _engagement_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _source_ _of_ _repentance_ _and_ _misery_ _to_ _each_ : _she_ _dissolved_ _it_ .-- This letter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt ' s death .
And I am sure , by his manner , it was no compliment .
" Yes , I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him ."
do the children grow ?
" You are expecting her again , you say , this morning ?"
" He has been here this very morning , on a most extraordinary errand .
" My dear Emma ," said he at last , with earnest kindness , " do you think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of ?"
I never compliment .
