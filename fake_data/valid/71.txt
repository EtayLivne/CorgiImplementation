I hope you find a chair .
" I do not know .-- One of the Otways .-- Not Frank ;-- it is not Frank , I assure you .
Oh !
_I_ think seriously of Miss Smith !-- Miss Smith is a very good sort of girl ; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled .
" Yes ."
Emma was most agreeably surprized .-- Mr .
He began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick - chamber again , for the present -- to entreat her to _promise_ _him_ not to venture into such hazard till he had seen Mr . Perry and learnt his opinion ; and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course , there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her .
They were looking over views in Swisserland .
" I am very glad , indeed , my dear , to hear she is to be so comfortably settled .
Every thing tender and charming was to mark their parting ; but still they were to part .
" You cannot do better , sir ."
He did consent .
I hope she is well ?"
But I am a partial old friend ."
Mr . Knightley was to dine with them -- rather against the inclination of Mr . Woodhouse , who did not like that any one should share with him in Isabella ' s first day .
_We_ have carriages to fetch and convey her home , and _we_ live in a style which could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax , at any time , the least inconvenient .-- I should be extremely displeased if Wright were to send us up such a dinner , as could make me regret having asked _more_ than Jane Fairfax to partake of it .
Mr . Elton was called out of the room before tea , old John Abdy ' s son wanted to speak with him .
" But you , who are so extremely fond of it -- there can be no danger , surely ?"
What could he mean by such horrible indelicacy ?
Tell me , I charge you tell me this moment what it is ."
" You do quite right ," said she ;--" we will make your apologies to Mr . and Mrs .
Emma felt they were friends again ; and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction , and then a little sauciness , she could not help saying , as he was admiring the baby ,
" And I assure you , Mr . Weston , I have very little doubt that my opinion will be decidedly in his favour .
" I am afraid ," said he , composing his features , " I am very much afraid , my dear Emma , that you will not smile when you hear it ."
She must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing , but if he were criticising her behaviour , she did not feel afraid .
Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet ' s fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose , for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr . Elton ' s being a remarkably handsome man , with most agreeable manners ; and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints , she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on Harriet ' s side , as there could be any occasion for .
The happiness of this most happy day , received its completion , in the animated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced .
It seemed as if her eyes were suddenly opened , and she were enabled to see that Mr . Elton was not the superior creature she had believed him .
Our part of London is very superior to most others !-- You must not confound us with London in general , my dear sir .
Harriet was too much agitated to encounter him .
Let us forgive each other at once .
If Jane repressed her for a little time , she soon began again ; and though much that passed between them was in a half - whisper , especially on Mrs . Elton ' s side , there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects : The post - office -- catching cold -- fetching letters -- and friendship , were long under discussion ; and to them succeeded one , which must be at least equally unpleasant to Jane -- inquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to suit her , and professions of Mrs . Elton ' s meditated activity .
She had had three weeks of happy exemption from Mr . Elton ; and Harriet ' s mind , she had been willing to hope , had been lately gaining strength .
To you , he will talk of farming ; to me , of drawing or music ; and so on to every body , having that general information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead , or take the lead , just as propriety may require , and to speak extremely well on each ; that is my idea of him ."
Remember how few minutes I was at Randalls , and in how bewildered , how mad a state : and I am not much better yet ; still insane either from happiness or misery .
" I am not speaking of its prudence ; merely its probability ."
I could very ill be spared -- but such a point had been made of my coming !
I think very well of Mr . Elton , and this is the only way I have of doing him a service ."
Mr . Weston directed the whole , officiating safely between Hartfield and the Vicarage , and every body was in good time .
yes , gloves and every thing .
His dejection was most evident .
That is what she writes about .
The evening before this great event ( for it was a very great event that Mr . Woodhouse should dine out , on the 24th of December ) had been spent by Harriet at Hartfield , and she had gone home so much indisposed with a cold , that , but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs . Goddard , Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house .
dear ; I was so miserable !
With all dear Emma ' s little faults , she is an excellent creature .
" The old lady !
What right had he to endeavour to please , as he certainly did -- to distinguish any one young woman with persevering attention , as he certainly did -- while he really belonged to another ?-- How could he tell what mischief he might be doing ?-- How could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him ?-- very wrong , very wrong indeed ."
" No , sir ," replied his son , laughing , " I seem to have had it from nobody .-- Very odd !-- I really was persuaded of Mrs . Weston ' s having mentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe , many weeks ago , with all these particulars -- but as she declares she never heard a syllable of it before , of course it must have been a dream .
The time was coming when the news must spread farther , and other persons ' reception of it tried .
He professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend -- her fair , lovely , amiable friend .
He might even have Harriet in his thoughts at the moment ; who could say ?
What say you to Mr . Weston and Mr . Elton ?
" No -- he should not eat .
But Mrs . Dixon must be very much disappointed .
Mr . Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury , and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed , though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life .
" Miss Smith !-- oh !-- I had not observed .-- You are extremely obliging -- and if I were not an old married man .-- But my dancing days are over , Mrs . Weston .
Some people were always cross when they were hot .
He went to Highbury the next morning , and satisfied himself on that point .
He has not been able to get the Romance of the Forest yet .
Mr . Elton was the only one whose assistance she asked .
He may be sure of every woman ' s approbation while he writes with such gallantry ."
They have no mercy on her ."
" That is very likely .
It was a great consolation that Mr . Elton should not be really in love with her , or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint him -- that Harriet ' s nature should not be of that superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive -- and that there could be no necessity for any body ' s knowing what had passed except the three principals , and especially for her father ' s being given a moment ' s uneasiness about it .
Such language for a young man entirely dependent , to use !-- Nobody but you , Mr . Knightley , would imagine it possible .
Mr . Martin , I imagine , has his fortune entirely to make -- cannot be at all beforehand with the world .
The symptoms were favourable .-- Instead of answering , Harriet turned away confused , and stood thoughtfully by the fire ; and though the letter was still in her hand , it was now mechanically twisted about without regard .
Very much grieved and concerned -- I had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as I knew had been given her in the morning ."
" Ah !
-- and as clearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth .
To Hartfield , if you please , Mrs .
Harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since those two decisive dances .-- Emma knew that he had , on that occasion , found her much superior to his expectation .
If any thing could be more , where all was most , she was more reserved on the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing .
While he was so dull , it was no wonder that Harriet should be dull likewise ; and they were both insufferable .
It was a pity that she had not come back earlier !
" Oh !
I am sure she will be an excellent servant ; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see .
Excepting yourself and your brother , I do not know his equal for temper .
This is feeling your way .
" Mr . Perry ," said he , in a voice of very strong displeasure , " would do as well to keep his opinion till it is asked for .
CHAPTER XVI
The carriage -- we had disappointments about the carriage ;-- one morning , I remember , he came to me quite in despair ."
I have never seen either Mr . or Mrs . Elton .
but her lips were closed .
What is before me , I see .
" And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess ?-- I pity you .-- I thought you cleverer -- for , depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck .
The acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her .
She depended on the evil feelings of the Eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther requisite .-- Harriet rational , Frank Churchill not too much in love , and Mr . Knightley not wanting to quarrel with her , how very happy a summer must be before her !
Miss Nash had been telling her something , which she repeated immediately with great delight .
" I do not wonder , Miss Woodhouse ," she resumed , " that you should feel a great difference between the two , as to me or as to any body .
" And then , he saved her life .
Mr . Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea , and was repeating , " No husbands and wives in the case at present indeed , as you observe .
We shall enjoy him completely ; every thing has turned out exactly as we could wish ."
If a separation of two months should not have cooled him , there were dangers and evils before her :-- caution for him and for herself would be necessary .
But it is his gratitude on Harriet ' s account ."
and A .-- Em - ma .-- Do you understand ?"
" Yes ," said his brother quickly , " it is Randalls that does it all ."
Mr . Elton was so hot and tired , that all this wit seemed thrown away .
" My dear papa , I sent the whole hind - quarter .
" Why , pretty well , my dear , upon the whole .
