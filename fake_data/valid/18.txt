" I will answer for it , that mine thinks herself full as clever , and would spurn any body ' s assistance ."
This is in the supposition of his attachment continuing what it now is ; but I do not know that I expect it will ; I do not look upon him to be quite the sort of man -- I do not altogether build upon his steadiness or constancy .-- His feelings are warm , but I can imagine them rather changeable .-- Every consideration of the subject , in short , makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved .-- I shall do very well again after a little while -- and then , it will be a good thing over ; for they say every body is in love once in their lives , and I shall have been let off easily ."
" Your parish there was small ," said Jane .
So then , I try to put it out of her thoughts , and say , Come ma ' am , do not let us think about it any more ."
This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed ; and Mr . Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure , as he stood up , in tall indignation , and said ,
Even then , I was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time ; but I was the injured person , injured by her coldness , and I went away determined that she should make the first advances .-- I shall always congratulate myself that you were not of the Box Hill party .
The child of good fortune !
" Thank you , sir , thank you ; I am going this moment myself ; and I think the sooner _you_ go the better .
The cold repast was over , and the party were to go out once more to see what had not yet been seen , the old Abbey fish - ponds ; perhaps get as far as the clover , which was to be begun cutting on the morrow , or , at any rate , have the pleasure of being hot , and growing cool again .-- Mr .
Mr . Knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort !-- No longer walking in at all hours , as if ever willing to change his own home for their ' s !-- How was it to be endured ?
yes , I am quite aware of that .
" Yes ," said Harriet earnestly , " and well she might , nobody could ever have a better .
How do you do , Mr .
I have not forgotten it , I assure you .-- Deceived myself , I did very miserably deceive you -- and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever .
" I am very much obliged to you ," said Emma , laughing again .
It is remarkable , that Emma , in the many , very many , points of view in which she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey , was never struck with any sense of injury to her nephew Henry , whose rights as heir - expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded .
cried Mr . John Knightley , hearing his own name .
This is saying very plainly --` Pray , Miss Smith , give me leave to pay my addresses to you .
When his letter to Mrs . Weston arrived , Emma had the perusal of it ; and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her at first shake her head over her own sensations , and think she had undervalued their strength .
Can it be Neptune ?
He was thinking .
I always say there is something direful in the sound : but nothing more is positively known of the Tupmans , though a good many things I assure you are suspected ; and yet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to my brother , Mr . Suckling , who happens to be one of their nearest neighbours .
Knightley ?"
" I often feel concern ," said she , " that I dare not make our carriage more useful on such occasions .
" I honour his sincerity .
so far off !-- and the air so bad !"
But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge !
I do not know who would ever look at him in the company of the other .
I certainly have been misunderstanding you , if you feel in doubt as to the _purport_ of your answer .
He had been used to think her unjust to Jane , and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement .
At present , I ask only to hear , once to hear your voice ."
yes , I am quite aware of that .
--" At a watering - place , or in a common London acquaintance , it was difficult to decide on such points .
In the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast , that the party to Box Hill was again under happy consideration ; and at last Donwell was settled for one day , and Box Hill for the next ,-- the weather appearing exactly right .
Very true .
And touching Miss Bates , who at that moment passed near --" Miss Bates , are you mad , to let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner ?
" Oh yes , sir ," cried she with ready sympathy , " how you must miss her !
The young man ' s conduct , and his sister ' s , seemed the result of real feeling , and she could not but pity them .
My poor mother does not know how to bear it .
I dare say , Miss Fairfax , that he either gave his friend very minute directions , or wrote to Broadwood himself .
The superior degree of confidence towards Harriet , which this one article marked , gave her severe pain .
" Oh !
here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us ; thank you for the sight of it .
However , I do really think Mr . Martin a very amiable young man , and have a great opinion of him ; and his being so much attached to me -- and his writing such a letter -- but as to leaving you , it is what I would not do upon any consideration ."
He was not in his best spirits , but seemed trying to improve them ; and , at last , made himself talk nonsense very agreeably .
" My dear , you do not understand me .
I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction , comfort , and delight to me , to hear what a musical society I am got into .
She looked back as well as she could ; but it was all confusion .
John Knightley ' s being a lawyer is very inconvenient .-- Poor Isabella !-- she is sadly taken away from us all !-- and how sorry she will be when she comes , not to see Miss Taylor here !"
" I rather doubt that .
Now was the time for Mr . Frank Churchill to come among them ; and the hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion .
Mrs . Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday , and asked all the three teachers , Miss Nash , and Miss Prince , and Miss Richardson , to sup with her ."
Mr . Woodhouse ' s peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill - bestowed .
" I think her beautiful , quite beautiful ."
At first , she thought it was a good deal ; and afterwards , but little .
You could not have gratified me more than by expressing an interest --.
Mr . Woodhouse taken from Hartfield !-- No , he felt that it ought not to be attempted .
Peculiarly lucky !-- for as to any real knowledge of a person ' s disposition that Bath , or any public place , can give -- it is all nothing ; there can be no knowledge .
" Oh !
But it is done ; we are reconciled , dearer , much dearer , than ever , and no moment ' s uneasiness can ever occur between us again .
That was all very true .
We shall only be making each other more angry .
I never knew days fly so fast .
For a little while Emma persevered in her silence ; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that letter might be too powerful , she thought it best to say ,
You only mean , that he intends it ."
As to myself , I am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings -- Nothing could be farther from my wishes -- your attachment to my friend Harriet -- your pursuit of her , ( pursuit , it appeared ,) gave me great pleasure , and I have been very earnestly wishing you success : but had I supposed that she were not your attraction to Hartfield , I should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent .
He was not exactly what she had expected ; less of the man of the world in some of his notions , less of the spoiled child of fortune , therefore better than she had expected .
dear , no ," said her companion .
I would much rather have been merry than wise ."
The style of the letter was much above her expectation .
I can allow for the fears of the child , but not of the man .
His information and prospects as to Enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated ; Mrs . Churchill was recovering , and he dared not yet , even in his own imagination , fix a time for coming to Randalls again .
I am sure it was a source of high entertainment to you , to feel that you were taking us all in .-- Perhaps I am the readier to suspect , because , to tell you the truth , I think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same situation .
" But the imprudence of such a match !"
Emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr . Martin ' s prose .
" Three - and - twenty !-- is he indeed ?-- Well , I could not have thought it -- and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother !
Things must come to a crisis soon now .
Well , and how did Mr . Churchill take it ?"
The day came , the party were punctually assembled , and Mr . John Knightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable .
We shall not be many , you know ."
" My idea of him is , that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of every body , and has the power as well as the wish of being universally agreeable .
The wants and sufferings of the poor family , however , were the first subject on meeting .
Dear Harriet !-- I would not change you for the clearest - headed , longest - sighted , best - judging female breathing .
She had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself .
" Aye , very true , my dear ," cried the latter , though Jane had not spoken a word --" I was just going to say the same thing .
It did not accord with the rationality of plan , the moderation in expense , or even the unselfish warmth of heart , which she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday .
Without knowing when the carriage turned into Vicarage Lane , or when it stopped , they found themselves , all at once , at the door of his house ; and he was out before another syllable passed .-- Emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good night .
" Ah , my dear ," said he , " poor Miss Taylor -- It is a grievous business ."
Her own behaviour had been so very improper !
I was sitting near the door -- Elizabeth saw me directly ; but he did not ; he was busy with the umbrella .
Jane she had a distinct glimpse of , looking extremely ill ; and , before the door had shut them out , she heard Miss Bates saying , " Well , my dear , I shall _say_ you are laid down upon the bed , and I am sure you are ill enough ."
There she is -- no , that ' s somebody else .
She was sensible of all the affection it evinced .
Mr . Knightley had spoken prophetically , when he once said , " Emma , you have been no friend to Harriet Smith ."
The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of Harriet ' s welfare , she was really in danger of becoming too happy for security .-- What had she to wish for ?
It is not likely that I _should_ , considering what I have been used to .
" Well , I am so sorry !-- Oh !
The ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant , " Men never know when things are dirty or not ;" and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to himself , " Women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares ."
asked Mrs .
" I have not been working uninterruptedly ," he replied , " I have been assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily , it was not quite firm ; an unevenness in the floor , I believe .
