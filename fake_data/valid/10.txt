My acquaintance with him has been but trifling .-- And even if I have not underrated him hitherto , he may yet turn out well .-- With such a woman he has a chance .-- I have no motive for wishing him ill -- and for her sake , whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct , I shall certainly wish him well ."
She would have been too happy but for poor Harriet ; but every blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend , who must now be even excluded from Hartfield .
He had , in fact , been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence .
united , what reverse we have !
Were you often in the same society ?"
" Did you ever see such a skin ?-- such smoothness !
Colonel Campbell , you know , is quite our angel .
Well , that is so very !-- I am sure if Jane is tired , you will be so kind as to give her your arm .-- Mr .
It was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey , that as soon as she was satisfied of her father ' s comfort , she was glad to leave him , and look around her ; eager to refresh and correct her memory with more particular observation , more exact understanding of a house and grounds which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family .
Emma ' s project of forgetting Mr . Elton for a while made her rather sorry to find , when they had all taken their places , that he was close to her .
But then , Mrs . Goddard will want to see it .-- And I could take the pattern gown home any day .
I have thought only of you .
she was not so easily to be talked out of it .
" Oh !
The same civilities and courtesies , the same success and satisfaction , took place on the morrow , and accompanied the whole progress of the picture , which was rapid and happy .
Do put up your horse at the Crown , and come in ."
" No ," cried Mr . Knightley , " that need not be the consequence .
He professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend -- her fair , lovely , amiable friend .
In that case , nothing could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on .
so silly -- so satisfied -- so smiling -- so prosing -- so undistinguishing and unfastidious -- and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me , I would marry to - morrow .
The strength of the song falls on the second ."
Here ,-- probably this basket with pink ribbon .
I do not consider myself at all a fortunate person ."
there he is .
" You had better explore to Donwell ," replied Mr . Knightley .
Now I cannot say , that I think you are any of you looking well at present ."
Natural enough !-- his own mind full of intrigue , that he should suspect it in others .-- Mystery ; Finesse -- how they pervert the understanding !
She hardly knew yet what Mr . Knightley would ask ; but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution of never quitting her father .-- She even wept over the idea of it , as a sin of thought .
They will stay a good while when they do come , and he will be half his time with us .
They hardly can satisfy a woman of her good sense and quick feelings : standing in a mother ' s place , but without a mother ' s affection to blind her .
" Yes -- what should hurt me ?-- I walk fast .
" But what are you in doubt of ?
Richard ?-- I saw you the other day as you rode through the town -- Mrs . Otway , I protest !-- and good Mr . Otway , and Miss Otway and Miss Caroline .-- Such a host of friends !-- and Mr . George and Mr .
" I wonder what they are all doing -- whether his sisters know -- if he is unhappy , they will be unhappy too .
She could not bear that her master should not be able to have another apple - tart this spring .
She understood their ways , could allow for their ignorance and their temptations , had no romantic expectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had done so little ; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy , and always gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good - will .
" No , no ," said she , " you are quite unreasonable .
You appear to me a little hoarse already , and when you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues to - morrow will bring , I think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to - night ."
It was a done thing ; Mr . Elton was to go , and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment ; never had his smile been stronger , nor his eyes more exulting than when he next looked at her .
A note was written to urge it .
She was all pleasure and gratitude , both for Harriet and herself , and longed to be thanking him ; and though too distant for speech , her countenance said much , as soon as she could catch his eye again .
" I see how it is ," said she .
Emma would not agree to this , and began a warm defence of Miss Fairfax ' s complexion .
Richard ?-- Oh !
He began -- stopping , however , almost directly to say , " Had I been offered the sight of one of this gentleman ' s letters to his mother - in - law a few months ago , Emma , it would not have been taken with such indifference ."
I never saw such a likeness in my life .
As I am happily quite an altered creature in _one_ _respect_ , it is very fit that you should have the satisfaction of knowing it .
" Conjecture -- aye , sometimes one conjectures right , and sometimes one conjectures wrong .
She had fallen into good hands , known nothing but kindness from the Campbells , and been given an excellent education .
CHAPTER I
The weather added what it could of gloom .
for the very moment Mr . Cole told Mrs . Cole of it , she sat down and wrote to me .
It is just what I used to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship , when , because things did not go quite right , did not proceed with all the rapidity which suited his feelings , he was apt to be in despair , and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be _May_ before Hymen ' s saffron robe would be put on for us .
The thing is determined , that is ( laughing affectedly ) as far as I can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master .
" My dear Miss Fairfax , young ladies are very sure to be cared for .-- I hope your good grand - mama and aunt are well .
" Well , go on ."
" That is to say , you chose to have your walk , for you were not six yards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you ; and Henry and John had seen more drops than they could count long before .
To Miss --
It had just occurred to Mrs . Weston that Mrs . Elton must be asked to begin the ball ; that she would expect it ; which interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction .-- Emma heard the sad truth with fortitude .
The shower was heavy , but short ; and it had not been over five minutes , when in came Harriet , with just the heated , agitated look which hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give ; and the " Oh !
These were pleasant feelings , and she walked about and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did , and collect round the strawberry - beds .-- The whole party were assembled , excepting Frank Churchill , who was expected every moment from Richmond ; and Mrs . Elton , in all her apparatus of happiness , her large bonnet and her basket , was very ready to lead the way in gathering , accepting , or talking -- strawberries , and only strawberries , could now be thought or spoken of .--" The best fruit in England -- every body ' s favourite -- always wholesome .-- These the finest beds and finest sorts .-- Delightful to gather for one ' s self -- the only way of really enjoying them .-- Morning decidedly the best time -- never tired -- every sort good -- hautboy infinitely superior -- no comparison -- the others hardly eatable -- hautboys very scarce -- Chili preferred -- white wood finest flavour of all -- price of strawberries in London -- abundance about Bristol -- Maple Grove -- cultivation -- beds when to be renewed -- gardeners thinking exactly different -- no general rule -- gardeners never to be put out of their way -- delicious fruit -- only too rich to be eaten much of -- inferior to cherries -- currants more refreshing -- only objection to gathering strawberries the stooping -- glaring sun -- tired to death -- could bear it no longer -- must go and sit in the shade ."
I do not care for myself .
" Certainly ; you must be sensible that the last half - year has made a great difference in your way of life ."
" This present from the Campbells ," said she --" this pianoforte is very kindly given ."
If I find him conversable , I shall be glad of his acquaintance ; but if he is only a chattering coxcomb , he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts ."
" My first enjoyment ," replied John Knightley , as they passed through the sweep - gate , " will be to find myself safe at Hartfield again ."
But colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn .
He was silent .
you amuse me excessively .
" One would rather have a stranger preferred than one ' s very particular friend -- with a stranger it might not recur again -- but the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand , to do every thing better than one does oneself !-- Poor Mrs . Dixon !
His face lengthened immediately ; and his voice was the voice of sentiment as he answered .
" This is too bad ," cried Emma , as they turned away .
Goddard ' s ."
I think your manners to him encouraging .
It was a pity , perhaps , that he had not come last night ; for , though the child seemed well now , very well considering , it would probably have been better if Perry had seen it ."
He would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided : she was sure he would not -- and she was expecting him every moment to escape into the card - room .
Mrs . Weston had been speaking to her at the same moment .
I am delighted to find that you can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander -- but it will not do -- very sorry to check you in your first essay -- but indeed it will not do .
" Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately ?
He never can bear to be thanked .
" That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast , of my present perfect indifference ," she continued , " I will farther tell you , that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance , when I did like him , when I was very much disposed to be attached to him -- nay , was attached -- and how it came to cease , is perhaps the wonder .
A likeness pleases every body ; and Miss Woodhouse ' s performances must be capital .
One has not great hopes from Birmingham .
" You forget how much she belongs to Highbury .
" I know _that_ is the feeling of you all .
Only my pattern gown is at Hartfield .
The Coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into any great family .
CHAPTER VI
" We shall never agree about him ," cried Emma ; " but that is nothing extraordinary .
and once Henry asked me for a knife , but I told him knives were only made for grandpapas .
She saw in a moment all the possible good .
She wished him to speak , but he would not .
if you were to see what a headache she has .
This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed ; and Mr . Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure , as he stood up , in tall indignation , and said ,
" Miss Fairfax , I suppose , though you were not aware of it , had been making up her mind the whole day ?"
I was ready to have gone with her , but this will do just as well .
You are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars .
He rode down for a couple of hours ; he could not yet do more ; but as he came from Randalls immediately to Hartfield , she could then exercise all her quick observation , and speedily determine how he was influenced , and how she must act .
They arrived , the carriage turned , the step was let down , and Mr . Elton , spruce , black , and smiling , was with them instantly .
" So I remember to have heard .
