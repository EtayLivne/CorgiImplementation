" Pray , Emma ," said he , " may I ask in what lay the great amusement , the poignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax ?
Chuse your own degree of crossness .
Cannot you invent a few hardships for yourself , and be contented to stay ?"
In short , she sat , during the first visit , looking at Jane Fairfax with twofold complacency ; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering justice , and was determining that she would dislike her no longer .
Two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the over - throw of every thing .
I never met with a disposition more truly amiable ."
_She_ certainly had not been in the wrong , and _he_ would never own that he had .
But , upon my word , Mr . Elton , in your case , I should certainly excuse myself .
` Oh !'
Her father never went beyond the shrubbery , where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long walk , or his short , as the year varied ; and since Mrs . Weston ' s marriage her exercise had been too much confined .
He joined them immediately , and , with scarcely an invitation , seated himself between them .
" Who is that gentleman on horseback ?"
Yes , quite a proposal of marriage ; and a very good letter , at least she thought so .
Goddard ' s ."
was his reply , but not at all in anger .
A Miss Hawkins -- that ' s all I know .
A little while ago , every letter to Isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties ; dinners at Mr . Cole ' s , or balls at the Crown .
As to men and women , our opinions are sometimes very different ; but with regard to these children , I observe we never disagree ."
dear , Kingston -- are you ?-- Mrs .
Let her marry Robert Martin , and she is safe , respectable , and happy for ever ; but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly , and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune , she may be a parlour - boarder at Mrs . Goddard ' s all the rest of her life -- or , at least , ( for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other ,) till she grow desperate , and is glad to catch at the old writing - master ' s son ."
think a farmer , ( and with all his sense and all his merit Mr . Martin is nothing more ,) a good match for my intimate friend !
Mrs . Weston , did you ever hear the like ?
A note was written to urge it .
Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas , and hoped , by the help of backgammon , to get her father tolerably through the evening , and be attacked by no regrets but her own .
A year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at West Hall ; and how they got their fortune nobody knows .
That will be very bad ."
Emma was a good deal surprized ; but begged her to speak .
Emma was most happy to be called to such a council ; and her father , engaging to think it all over while she was gone , the two young people set off together without delay for the Crown .
There was a communication before her , one which _she_ only could be competent to make -- the confession of her engagement to her father ; but she would have nothing to do with it at present .-- She had resolved to defer the disclosure till Mrs . Weston were safe and well .
He has no occasion to marry , either to fill up his time or his heart ."
Natural enough !-- his own mind full of intrigue , that he should suspect it in others .-- Mystery ; Finesse -- how they pervert the understanding !
But what is the meaning of this ?
Its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind -- and it must be saving her from the danger of degradation .
You need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here .
She was , moreover , perpetually hearing about him ; for , excepting when at Hartfield , she was always among those who saw no fault in Mr . Elton , and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his concerns ; and every report , therefore , every guess -- all that had already occurred , all that might occur in the arrangement of his affairs , comprehending income , servants , and furniture , was continually in agitation around her .
no -- I never conceived you could become indifferent .
WINDSOR - JULY .
She is known only as parlour - boarder at a common school .
The friends from whom she had just parted , though very good sort of people , must be doing her harm .
It was some days before she saw Jane Fairfax , to judge of her honest regret in this woeful change ; but when they did meet , her composure was odious .
She calls you , Knightley -- what can she do for Mr . Cole ?
" Nay , dear Emma , now I must take his part ; for though he has been wrong in this instance , I have known him long enough to answer for his having many , very many , good qualities ; and --"
There was intimacy between them , and Mr . Cole had heard from Mr . Elton since his going away .
Can you seriously ask me , Harriet , whether I imagined him attached to another woman at the very time that I was -- tacitly , if not openly -- encouraging you to give way to your own feelings ?-- I never had the slightest suspicion , till within the last hour , of Mr . Frank Churchill ' s having the least regard for Jane Fairfax .
Absolutely insufferable !
You provide for the family , you know , ( with a smile at his father ).
I shall wear a large bonnet , and bring one of my little baskets hanging on my arm .
" Be satisfied ," said he , " I will not raise any outcry .
cried Harriet .
He was warm in his reprobation of Mr . Elton ' s conduct ; it had been unpardonable rudeness ; and Mrs . Elton ' s looks also received the due share of censure .
They owed to him their two or three politest puzzles ; and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled , and rather sentimentally recited , that well - known charade ,
And who but Mr . Knightley could know and bear with Mr . Woodhouse , so as to make such an arrangement desirable !-- The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr . Woodhouse had been always felt in her husband ' s plans and her own , for a marriage between Frank and Emma .
" Just as they always do -- very vulgar ."
The couplet does not cease to be , nor does its meaning change .
Look at her .
Have not I some right to complain ?
Miss Woodhouse , what a pity that I must not write this beautiful charade into my book !
Surry is the garden of England ."
I must make myself very disagreeable , or she would not have said such a thing to an old friend ."
Dear Miss Woodhouse , how could you so mistake me ?"
She thinks so little of her own beauty .
" Oh !
She had been often remiss , her conscience told her so ; remiss , perhaps , more in thought than fact ; scornful , ungracious .
" Have you any idea of Mr . Knightley ' s returning your affection ?"
leave all that to me .
My dear Isabella , I have not heard you make one inquiry about Mr . Perry yet ; and he never forgets you ."
Mr . Knightley , a sensible man about seven or eight - and - thirty , was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family , but particularly connected with it , as the elder brother of Isabella ' s husband .
" You will soon be cooler , if you sit still ," said Emma .
" Will you ?"
" Oh !
I have nothing to do with William ' s wants , but it really is of very great importance that _I_ should see Knightley to - day ; and it becomes a matter , therefore , of very serious inconvenience that I should have had this hot walk to no purpose ."
Only my pattern gown is at Hartfield .
" To be sure we do ," cried his father ; " Mrs . Bates -- we passed her house -- I saw Miss Bates at the window .
They combated the point some time longer in the same way ; Emma rather gaining ground over the mind of her friend ; for Mrs . Weston was the most used of the two to yield ; till a little bustle in the room shewed them that tea was over , and the instrument in preparation ;-- and at the same moment Mr . Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse would do them the honour of trying it .
I hope I have a better taste than to think of Mr . Frank Churchill , who is like nobody by his side .
The loss of the ball -- the loss of the young man -- and all that the young man might be feeling !-- It was too wretched !-- Such a delightful evening as it would have been !-- Every body so happy !
I cannot be so sanguine as Mr . Weston .
" How very pleasing and proper of him !"
" Yes , our good Mrs . Elton .
She saw , that in persuading herself , in fancying , in acting to the contrary , she had been entirely under a delusion , totally ignorant of her own heart -- and , in short , that she had never really cared for Frank Churchill at all !
" It is impossible for me to doubt any longer .
His face lengthened immediately ; and his voice was the voice of sentiment as he answered .
He did so , but very soon stopt again to say , " the pianoforte !
Her silence disturbed him ; and after observing her a little while , he added ,
no ; there would be a Mrs . Knightley to throw cold water on every thing .-- Extremely disagreeable !
I cannot see you acting wrong , without a remonstrance .
I am glad he can afford it .
When she became sensible of this , it struck her that she could not be very much in love ; for in spite of her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father , never to marry , a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings .
Goddard ' s ."
" How do you like Mrs .
Nothing , but to grow more worthy of him , whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own .
We both abhor suspense .
I shall leave off while I am well ."
" Is not this most vexations , Knightley ?"
Perfectly remember Mrs . Perry ' s coming .-- Extraordinary dream , indeed !"
The strength of the song falls on the second ."
In the few minutes ' conversation which she had yet had with him , while Harriet had been partially insensible , he had spoken of her terror , her naivete , her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm , with a sensibility amused and delighted ; and just at last , after Harriet ' s own account had been given , he had expressed his indignation at the abominable folly of Miss Bickerton in the warmest terms .
The distressing explanation she had to make to Harriet , and all that poor Harriet would be suffering , with the awkwardness of future meetings , the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance , of subduing feelings , concealing resentment , and avoiding eclat , were enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections some time longer , and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most dreadfully .
Vigorous , decided , with sentiments to a certain point , not coarse .
" It was an awkward business , my dear , your spending the autumn at South End instead of coming here .
