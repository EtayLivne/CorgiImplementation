Knightley .'
Quite a humourist .
" We were too magnificent ," said he .
She determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers .
yes , perfectly .-- Why do you make a doubt of it ?"
She spoke with great agitation ; and Emma very feelingly replied , " That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now .
" Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old .
Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings , Mr . and Mrs . Weston ' s visit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune .
Mrs . Weston ' s communications furnished Emma with more food for unpleasant reflection , by increasing her esteem and compassion , and her sense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax .
I must get rid of every thing .-- There it goes , and there is an end , thank Heaven !
Harriet did not consider herself as having any thing to complain of .
How that visit was to be acknowledged -- what would be necessary -- and what might be safest , had been a point of some doubtful consideration .
" Nor , if you were , could I ever bear to part with you , my Harriet .
A week to - morrow !-- And I have hardly begun to enjoy myself .
The circumstance was told him at Hartfield ; for the moment , he was silent ; but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself , over a newspaper he held in his hand , " Hum !
But there is nobody hereabouts to attach her ; and she goes so seldom from home ."
We must look to her one fault , and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement , to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment ."
" Yes ," said his brother quickly , " it is Randalls that does it all ."
Miss Bates should never again -- no , never !
You knew I should not stir till my lord and master appeared .-- Here have I been sitting this hour , giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal obedience -- for who can say , you know , how soon it may be wanted ?"
It was his duty .
" You must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax should be allowed to come to you at such a time .
Papa , if you speak in that melancholy way , you will be giving Isabella a false idea of us all .
Dear Jane , how shall we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama ?
" So do I ," said Mrs . Weston gently , " very much ."
A little curiosity Emma had ; and she made the most of it while her friend related .
And in this style he talked on for some time very properly , not much attending to any answer , but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat ; and Emma was quite in charity with him .
Mr . Elton ' s engagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting Mr . Martin .
It seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely serious , which she did not wish .
She had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait .
You are not just to Harriet ' s claims .
A superior performer !-- very far from it , I assure you .
Jane ' s curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to occupy her .
-- Ford ' s was the principal woollen - draper , linen - draper , and haberdasher ' s shop united ; the shop first in size and fashion in the place .--" And so , there she had set , without an idea of any thing in the world , full ten minutes , perhaps -- when , all of a sudden , who should come in -- to be sure it was so very odd !-- but they always dealt at Ford ' s -- who should come in , but Elizabeth Martin and her brother !-- Dear Miss Woodhouse !
" There might be scruples of delicacy , my dear Emma .
I think you play quite as well as she does .
Much better employed talking to the young ladies .
she cried with more thorough gaiety , " if you fancy your brother does not do me justice , only wait till my dear father is in the secret , and hear his opinion .
Richard ?-- Oh !
I shall write to Mrs . Partridge in a day or two , and shall give her a strict charge to be on the look - out for any thing eligible ."
" I honour his sincerity .
Every part of it brought pain and humiliation , of some sort or other ; but , compared with the evil to Harriet , all was light ; and she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken -- more in error -- more disgraced by mis - judgment , than she actually was , could the effects of her blunders have been confined to herself .
I am much mistaken if Emma ' s doctrines give any strength of mind , or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in life .-- They only give a little polish ."
.
How delightful !"
Somebody had placed her , several years back , at Mrs . Goddard ' s school , and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlour - boarder .
This , on his side , might merely proceed from her not being thought of ; but Emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy , and a suspicion , from some appearances , that their friendship were declining .
Yes , next week .
" Thank you ," said he , in an accent of deep mortification , and not another syllable followed .
The lovers were standing together at one of the windows .
And , without love , I am sure I should be a fool to change such a situation as mine .
I hope you will think better of their looks to - morrow ; for I assure you Mr . Wingfield told me , that he did not believe he had ever sent us off altogether , in such good case .
I am exceedingly sorry : but it is well that the mistake ends where it does .
Mr . Weston ' s sanguine temper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions ; but Mr . Weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured to gain it .-- Very true ; he did not come till Miss Fairfax was here ."
His ideas seemed more moderate -- his feelings warmer .
In spite of the answer , therefore , she ordered the carriage , and drove to Mrs . Bates ' s , in the hope that Jane would be induced to join her -- but it would not do ;-- Miss Bates came to the carriage door , all gratitude , and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest service -- and every thing that message could do was tried -- but all in vain .
That would have been too dreadful !-- What an escape !-- Dear Miss Woodhouse , I would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world ."
On the contrary , her plans and proceedings were more and more justified and endeared to her by the general appearances of the next few days .
I do not say when , but perhaps you may guess where ;-- in the building in which N . takes M . for better , for worse ."
Their love of society , and their new dining - room , prepared every body for their keeping dinner - company ; and a few parties , chiefly among the single men , had already taken place .
The Coles expressed themselves so properly -- there was so much real attention in the manner of it -- so much consideration for her father .
" It is a most repulsive quality , indeed ," said he .
Who makes you their confidant ?"
I went in for three minutes , and was detained by Miss Bates ' s being absent .
We shall be most happy to consider you as one of the party ."
She paused a few moments .
A very proper compliment !-- and then follows the application , which I think , my dear Harriet , you cannot find much difficulty in comprehending .
" You seem determined to think ill of him ."
Jane said so .
" Yes ."
You , whom she had known from an infant , whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour , to have you now , in thoughtless spirits , and the pride of the moment , laugh at her , humble her -- and before her niece , too -- and before others , many of whom ( certainly _some_ ,) would be entirely guided by _your_ treatment of her .-- This is not pleasant to you , Emma -- and it is very far from pleasant to me ; but I must , I will ,-- I will tell you truths while I can ; satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel , and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now ."
But what shall I say ?
" Having understood as much , I was rather astonished to find her so very lady - like !
He remained at Hartfield after all the rest , his thoughts full of what he had seen ; so full , that when the candles came to assist his observations , he must -- yes , he certainly must , as a friend -- an anxious friend -- give Emma some hint , ask her some question .
" Does nothing occur to you ?-- Do not you recollect ?-- Harriet Smith ."
" If he would be so good as to read to them , it would be a kindness indeed !
It is the greatest absurdity -- Actually snowing at this moment !-- The folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home -- and the folly of people ' s not staying comfortably at home when they can !
It would not have been the awkwardness of a moment , it would have been rather a pleasure , previous to the suspicions of this very day ; she could have talked to him of Harriet , and the three - quarters of a mile would have seemed but one .
" They are blended ," said he , " I acknowledge ; and , were she prosperous , I could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over the good .
" I dare say your apologies were accepted , sir .
This had happened the year before .
" Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately ?
yes -- did not you know ?-- Well , well , never mind ."
Do not forget your engagement ."
In the warmth of true contrition , she would call upon her the very next morning , and it should be the beginning , on her side , of a regular , equal , kindly intercourse .
Do you think it will look well ?"
Ever since the service he rendered Jane at Weymouth , when they were out in that party on the water , and she , by the sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails , would have been dashed into the sea at once , and actually was all but gone , if he had not , with the greatest presence of mind , caught hold of her habit -- ( I can never think of it without trembling !)
Emma had done .
The pleasure is not enhanced , and the inconvenience is often considerable .
They would be very much pleased ."
Elton may talk sentimentally , but he will act rationally .
Mrs . Weston and Emma were sitting together on a sofa .
" You appear to feel a great deal -- but I am not aware how you or any of Miss Fairfax ' s acquaintance here , any of those who have known her longer than yourself , can shew her any other attention than "--
She wished him very well ; but he gave her pain , and his welfare twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction .
at three - and - twenty to be the king of his company -- the great man -- the practised politician , who is to read every body ' s character , and make every body ' s talents conduce to the display of his own superiority ; to be dispensing his flatteries around , that he may make all appear like fools compared with himself !
are you there ?-- But you are miserably behindhand .
Some time afterwards it was , " I think Mrs . Goddard would be very much surprized if she knew what had happened .
said Mr . Weston .
Perry does not call it altogether a sickly season ."
he is off .
