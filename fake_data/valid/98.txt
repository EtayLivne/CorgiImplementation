How very odd !"
" Conjecture -- aye , sometimes one conjectures right , and sometimes one conjectures wrong .
But here there was nothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future .
" I am almost certain that the meeting at the Crown is not till to - morrow .-- Mr .
" What a comfort it is , that we think alike about our nephews and nieces .
Lively as he was , it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself ; but what decided her belief on the subject , was his staying only a quarter of an hour , and hurrying away to make other calls in Highbury .
Her introductions and recommendations must all wait , and every projected party be still only talked of .
" I am ,"-- she answered --" I am fatigued ; but it is not the sort of fatigue -- quick walking will refresh me .-- Miss Woodhouse , we all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits .
Do you think it will look well ?"
It depends entirely upon his aunt ' s spirits and pleasure ; in short , upon her temper .
He was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing else -- which is just as it should be , for a thriving man .
` My dear ,' said I , ` you will blind yourself '-- for tears were in her eyes perpetually .
It was too old a story .-- Robert Martin had probably ceased to think of Harriet .-- They took a few turns together along the walk .-- The shade was most refreshing , and Emma found it the pleasantest part of the day .
Her affection must have overpowered her judgment ."
An old married man -- quite good for nothing .
Cole ."
Her father ' s comfort was amply secured , Mrs . Bates as well as Mrs . Goddard being able to come ; and her last pleasing duty , before she left the house , was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after dinner ; and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her dress , to make the two ladies all the amends in her power , by helping them to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine , for whatever unwilling self - denial his care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise during the meal .-- She had provided a plentiful dinner for them ; she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it .
With the greatest respect , and the warmest friendship , do I mention Miss Woodhouse ; my father perhaps will think I ought to add , with the deepest humiliation .-- A few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion , and some censure I acknowledge myself liable to .-- My behaviour to Miss Woodhouse indicated , I believe , more than it ought .-- In order to assist a concealment so essential to me , I was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately thrown .-- I cannot deny that Miss Woodhouse was my ostensible object -- but I am sure you will believe the declaration , that had I not been convinced of her indifference , I would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on .-- Amiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is , she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached ; and that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me , was as much my conviction as my wish .-- She received my attentions with an easy , friendly , goodhumoured playfulness , which exactly suited me .
" And I do envy him , Emma .
" You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs . and Miss Bates ," said Emma , " I have not heard one inquiry after them ."
There were not merely no grammatical errors , but as a composition it would not have disgraced a gentleman ; the language , though plain , was strong and unaffected , and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer .
Knightley is quite the gentleman .
Such kind friends , you know , Miss Woodhouse , one must always find agreeable , though every body seemed rather fagged after the morning ' s party .
The two ladies looked over it together ; and he sat smiling and talking to them the whole time , in a voice a little subdued , but very audible to every body .
He had reached Randalls the evening before .
I believe I was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper ."
He has a wife and family to maintain , and is not to be giving away his time .
and she and her partner the happiest !--" I said it would be so ," was the only consolation .
As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return , that was a mere joke ; he was afraid they would find no difficulty .
Oh no !
She was obliged to stop and think .
My greatest danger , perhaps , in housekeeping , may be quite the other way , in doing too much , and being too careless of expense .
Miss Churchill , however , being of age , and with the full command of her fortune -- though her fortune bore no proportion to the family - estate -- was not to be dissuaded from the marriage , and it took place , to the infinite mortification of Mr . and Mrs . Churchill , who threw her off with due decorum .
It was almost enough to make her think of marrying .
" Knightley !"
I am thwarted in every thing material .
Your views for Harriet are best known to yourself ; but as you make no secret of your love of match - making , it is fair to suppose that views , and plans , and projects you have ;-- and as a friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton is the man , I think it will be all labour in vain ."
Well , now I have just given you a hint of what Jane writes about , we will turn to her letter , and I am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than I can tell it for her ."
Consider , she is sitting down -- which naturally presents a different -- which in short gives exactly the idea -- and the proportions must be preserved , you know .
Give me the paper and listen .
Mr . Elton was only too happy .
A long time , is not it , for a cold to hang upon her ?
She was as happy as possible with the Martins in the summer .
" It is too much a matter of fact , but here it is .-- What two letters of the alphabet are there , that express perfection ?"
It would be the greatest pleasure to them , if you could allow me to attend you there .
I can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from Miss Bates , than I can believe in the triumph of Miss Fairfax ' s mind over Mrs . Elton .
It was natural for him to feel that he had _cause_ to sigh .
" Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced .
She stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse , and then resumed a more serious , more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been , and might be , and must be .
I thought I could not be so deceived ; but now , it is clear ; the state of his mind is as clear and decided , as my wishes on the subject have been ever since I knew you .
Another view of man , my second brings ; Behold him there , the monarch of the seas !
And I will own to you , ( I am sure it will be safe ), that so far as our living with Mr . Churchill at Enscombe , it is settled .
Emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost ; and all that was amiable , all that ought to be attaching , seemed on Harriet ' s side , not her own .
The impossibility of her quitting her father , Mr . Knightley felt as strongly as herself ; but the inadmissibility of any other change , he could not agree to .
CHARADE .
cried Emma , after a moment ' s pause --" What do you mean ?-- Good Heaven !
She said no more , other subjects took their turn ; and the rest of the dinner passed away ; the dessert succeeded , the children came in , and were talked to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation ; a few clever things said , a few downright silly , but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the other -- nothing worse than everyday remarks , dull repetitions , old news , and heavy jokes .
The greatest kindness you can shew me , will be to let me have my own way , and only say that I am gone when it is necessary ."
They were called on to share in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses , and obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others ; but when the table was again safely covered , when every corner dish was placed exactly right , and occupation and ease were generally restored , Emma said ,
Harriet was too much agitated to encounter him .
" It is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion ," said Mr . Knightley .
He may be sure of every woman ' s approbation while he writes with such gallantry ."
at three - and - twenty to be the king of his company -- the great man -- the practised politician , who is to read every body ' s character , and make every body ' s talents conduce to the display of his own superiority ; to be dispensing his flatteries around , that he may make all appear like fools compared with himself !
It must be all conjecture ."
" Is not she looking well ?"
yes ; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to Highbury .
If I had not promoted Mr . Weston ' s visits here , and given many little encouragements , and smoothed many little matters , it might not have come to any thing after all .
How very odd !
The cold , however , was severe ; and by the time the second carriage was in motion , a few flakes of snow were finding their way down , and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time .
For the world would not she have seemed to threaten me .-- Imagine the shock ; imagine how , till I had actually detected my own blunder , I raved at the blunders of the post .-- What was to be done ?-- One thing only .-- I must speak to my uncle .
He is a most charming young man .
.
that ball !-- why did we wait for any thing ?-- why not seize the pleasure at once ?-- How often is happiness destroyed by preparation , foolish preparation !-- You told us it would be so .-- Oh !
Let me return your congratulations .-- I assure you that I have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction .-- He is a man whom I cannot presume to praise ."
He did not omit being sometimes directly before Miss Smith , or speaking to those who were close to her .-- Emma saw it .
A week had not passed since Miss Hawkins ' s name was first mentioned in Highbury , before she was , by some means or other , discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind ; to be handsome , elegant , highly accomplished , and perfectly amiable : and when Mr . Elton himself arrived to triumph in his happy prospects , and circulate the fame of her merits , there was very little more for him to do , than to tell her Christian name , and say whose music she principally played .
Happily it was not necessary to speak .
Harriet is disgraced by any comparison .
His good - nature , his humanity , as I tell you , would be quite enough to account for the horses .
at present I ask no more ."
They , in their different homes , and their different ways , might be looking back on it with pleasure ; but in her view it was a morning more completely misspent , more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time , and more to be abhorred in recollection , than any she had ever passed .
The Eltons walked together ; Mr . Knightley took charge of Miss Bates and Jane ; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill .
She was delighted to see her father look comfortable , and very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well ; but the quiet prosings of three such women made her feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she had fearfully anticipated .
He knows that he is a very handsome young man , and a great favourite wherever he goes ; and from his general way of talking in unreserved moments , when there are only men present , I am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away .
yes , I observed it , I assure you .
He was gone the next moment :-- after another moment ' s pause ,
Emma had not to listen to such paradings again -- to any so exclusively addressed to herself -- so disgustingly decorated with a " dear Miss Woodhouse ."
Indeed I must say that , much as I had heard of him before and much as I had expected , he very far exceeds any thing .
She would have been too happy but for poor Harriet ; but every blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend , who must now be even excluded from Hartfield .
She then broke the lace off short , and dexterously throwing it into a ditch , was presently obliged to entreat them to stop , and acknowledged her inability to put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort .
Knightley .--" Robert Martin ' s manners have sense , sincerity , and good - humour to recommend them ; and his mind has more true gentility than Harriet Smith could understand ."
My friend Robert could not resist .
He wishes exceedingly to come ; but his uncle and aunt will not spare him ."
" Very true .-- Well , a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again , late at night , and cold as the nights are now .
There are secrets in all families , you know )-- The case is , that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in January ; and that Frank ' s coming depends upon their being put off .
" Might he be trusted with the commission , what infinite pleasure should he have in executing it !
Harriet , necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins , was less and less at Hartfield ; which was not to be regretted .-- The intimacy between her and Emma must sink ; their friendship must change into a calmer sort of goodwill ; and , fortunately , what ought to be , and must be , seemed already beginning , and in the most gradual , natural manner .
Pray take care , Miss Woodhouse , ours is rather a dark staircase -- rather darker and narrower than one could wish .
" I cannot make a question , or listen to a question about that .
It would be almost beginning their life of civility again .
