I could not bear it for Emma !-- Emma is not strong .
He would do any good to her , or her family ; but --"
So began Miss Bates ; and Mr . Knightley seemed determined to be heard in his turn , for most resolutely and commandingly did he say ,
for shame !"
It is my daily errand .
There was a bustle on her approach ; a good deal of moving and talking .
-- And in a louder , steadier tone , he concluded with , " He will soon be gone .
I mean in person -- tall , and with that sort of look -- and not very talkative ."
His good friend Perry , too , whom he had spoken to on the subject , did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind ; but he had desired Perry to be upon the watch , and as he went about so much , something , he thought , might come from that quarter .
She had a moment ' s fear of Miss Bates keeping away from her .
Emma is spoiled by being the cleverest of her family .
That is , _I_ always had a strong persuasion he would be here again soon , I was sure something favourable would turn up -- but nobody believed me .
" Or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument -- which must now be shut up in London , untouched by any body ."
was Mrs . Weston ' s parting question .
Emma listened , and looked , and soon perceived that Frank Churchill ' s state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of humour .
no , no "-- cried Emma , laughing as carelessly as she could -- " Upon no account in the world .
I wonder which she will think the handsomest , Henry or John ?"
You will see nothing of it by candlelight .
To Highbury in general it brought no material change .
for shame !"
At this moment , an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma ' s brain with regard to Jane Fairfax , this charming Mr . Dixon , and the not going to Ireland , she said , with the insidious design of farther discovery ,
We always say what we like to one another ."
You knew I should not stir till my lord and master appeared .-- Here have I been sitting this hour , giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal obedience -- for who can say , you know , how soon it may be wanted ?"
Man ' s boasted power and freedom , all are flown .
yes , I observed it , I assure you .
They must both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and concealment ."
Emma knew that she had , but would not own it ; and Mr . Elton warmly added ,
So she thought at first ;-- but a little consideration convinced her that every thing need not be put off .
" And do you see her , sir , tolerably often ?"
Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet ' s fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose , for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr . Elton ' s being a remarkably handsome man , with most agreeable manners ; and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints , she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on Harriet ' s side , as there could be any occasion for .
Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own !
And , by the bye , every body ought to have two pair of spectacles ; they should indeed .
Their affection was always to subside into friendship .
But I could not reason so to a man in love , and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her , to her having that sort of disposition , which , in good hands , like his , might be easily led aright and turn out very well .
He presently added , with a smile ,
` The consequence ,' said she , ` has been a state of perpetual suffering to me ; and so it ought .
My Emma , does not every thing serve to prove more and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other ?"
But still I cannot imagine she would not be persuaded ."
How will a conundrum reckon ?"
Miss Woodhouse , I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball .
He came to speak to his father on a subject ,-- to announce an attachment --"
" You , Emma , who have so few opportunities of dancing , you are really out of luck ; you are very much out of luck !"
It was settled so , upon the hill , while we were walking about with Mr . Knightley .
There was not a dissentient voice on the subject , either when Mrs . Perry drank tea with Mrs . and Miss Bates , or when Mrs . and Miss Bates returned the visit .
" Me , my love ," cried his wife , hearing and understanding only in part .-- " Are you talking about me ?-- I am sure nobody ought to be , or can be , a greater advocate for matrimony than I am ; and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving Hartfield , I should never have thought of Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world ; and as to slighting Mr . Weston , that excellent Mr . Weston , I think there is nothing he does not deserve .
She could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty .
There will be enough for every hope and every fear ; and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent , it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder .
Mr . Churchill has pride ; but his pride is nothing to his wife ' s : his is a quiet , indolent , gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody , and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome ; but her pride is arrogance and insolence !
( looking round with the most good - humoured dependence on every body ' s assent )-- Do not you all think I shall ?"
It is my daily errand .
That is the key to a great deal of capacity .
" But there may be pretty good guessing .
But -- that he should talk of encouragement , should consider her as aware of his views , accepting his attentions , meaning ( in short ), to marry him !-- should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind !-- look down upon her friend , so well understanding the gradations of rank below him , and be so blind to what rose above , as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her !-- It was most provoking .
The friends from whom she had just parted , though very good sort of people , must be doing her harm .
I hope he will not mind it so very much ."
Perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her inferior in talent , and all the elegancies of mind .
Miss Churchill , however , being of age , and with the full command of her fortune -- though her fortune bore no proportion to the family - estate -- was not to be dissuaded from the marriage , and it took place , to the infinite mortification of Mr . and Mrs . Churchill , who threw her off with due decorum .
Weston ?-- Judge between us .
She would be respectable and happy ; and Emma admitted her to be the luckiest creature in the world , to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a man ;-- or , if not quite the luckiest , to yield only to herself .
" Mr . Elton going to be married !"
A very few to - morrows stood between the young people of Highbury and happiness .
" Ah !
Miss Woodhouse , the comfort of being sometimes alone !"
Harriet was standing at one of the windows .
" I think they will neither of them do the other any good ."
He had expressed himself as to coming , with more than common certainty .
" Poor girl !"
They are to be new set .
yes , very .
" Oh !
" I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother ," cried Emma , " about your friend Mr . Graham ' s intending to have a bailiff from Scotland , to look after his new estate .
He was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing else -- which is just as it should be , for a thriving man .
" He has not been here yet ," replied Emma .
It was enough for her to feel .
Jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour , and they had only accomplished some views of St . Mark ' s Place , Venice , when Frank Churchill entered the room .
And , by the bye , every body ought to have two pair of spectacles ; they should indeed .
If we feel for the wretched , enough to do all we can for them , the rest is empty sympathy , only distressing to ourselves ."
" But it is too far , indeed it is , to be walking quite alone .
Its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind -- and it must be saving her from the danger of degradation .
for , if we had met first in the drawing - room , I doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual .-- You might not have distinguished how I came , by my look or manner ."
If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment , I have nothing to say against it , but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me .-- Oh !
" It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it ," said the young man , " though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far ; but in coming _home_ I felt I might do any thing ."
" Thank you , thank you .-- This is just what I wanted to be assured of .-- Oh !
At the time of the ballroom ' s being built , suppers had not been in question ; and a small card - room adjoining , was the only addition .
said Mrs . Weston , " have not you finished it yet ?
" Yes , to be sure , I suppose there are .
My acquaintance with him has been but trifling .-- And even if I have not underrated him hitherto , he may yet turn out well .-- With such a woman he has a chance .-- I have no motive for wishing him ill -- and for her sake , whose happiness will be involved in his good character and conduct , I shall certainly wish him well ."
said Mr . Weston , looking about .
no -- I never conceived you could become indifferent .
I should not like a man who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning .
He walked off to find his father , but was quickly back again with both Mr . and Mrs . Weston .
This lesson , she very much feared , they would receive only from herself ; she had little hope of Mr . Knightley , none of Mr . Weston .
as to all that , of course nothing can be thought of yet .
I see the difference plain enough .
Man ' s boasted power and freedom , all are flown ; Lord of the earth and sea , he bends a slave , And woman , lovely woman , reigns alone .
She was so surprized she did not know what to do .
" Aye -- like Maple Grove , I dare say .
She had previously determined how far she would proceed , on any application of the sort ; and it would be safer for both , to have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed .-- She was decided , and thus spoke --
" Nay , why do you ?"
Disputable , however , as might be the taste of such a termination , it was in itself a charming walk , and the view which closed it extremely pretty .-- The considerable slope , at nearly the foot of which the Abbey stood , gradually acquired a steeper form beyond its grounds ; and at half a mile distant was a bank of considerable abruptness and grandeur , well clothed with wood ;-- and at the bottom of this bank , favourably placed and sheltered , rose the Abbey Mill Farm , with meadows in front , and the river making a close and handsome curve around it .
