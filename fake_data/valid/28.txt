Quite otherwise indeed , if I understood Miss Fairfax ' s opinion last night ."
" It is hotter to - day ."
His importance at Enscombe was very evident .
" Ah !
Before this time last year I assure you we had had a delightful exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston ."
" Excuse me , ma ' am , but this is by no means my intention ; I make no inquiry myself , and should be sorry to have any made by my friends .
But now I have no doubt of seeing him here about the second week in January ."
Time , she knew , must be allowed for this being thoroughly done ; and she could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general , and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr . Elton in particular ; but it seemed to her reasonable that at Harriet ' s age , and with the entire extinction of all hope , such a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr . Elton ' s return , as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance , without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them .
for myself , I protest I must be excused ," said Mrs . Elton ; " _I_ really cannot attempt -- I am not at all fond of the sort of thing .
you clever creature , that ' s very true .
Mr . Woodhouse would have been miserable had his daughter attempted it , and she was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas .
Come on a donkey , however , if you prefer it .
Another room of much better size might be secured for the purpose ; but it was at the other end of the house , and a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it .
Mr . Elton ' s rights , however , gradually revived .
I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly what every man delights in -- what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment .
good Mr . Perry -- how is he , sir ?"
Emma continued ,
The dread of such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness ; and when Harriet appeared , and in very good spirits , and without having any such reason to give for her long absence , she felt a satisfaction which settled her with her own mind , and convinced her , that let Mr . Knightley think or say what he would , she had done nothing which woman ' s friendship and woman ' s feelings would not justify .
" But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles .
" Never mind , Harriet , I shall not be a poor old maid ; and it is poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public !
Disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn .
My being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration .
He had , in fact , been wholly unsuspicious of his own influence .
" The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me .
" I am sorry to hear you say so , sir ; but I assure you , excepting those little nervous head - aches and palpitations which I am never entirely free from anywhere , I am quite well myself ; and if the children were rather pale before they went to bed , it was only because they were a little more tired than usual , from their journey and the happiness of coming .
This was one of her expressions .
Men of sense , whatever you may chuse to say , do not want silly wives .
Miss Woodhouse was so great a personage in Highbury , that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure ; but the humble , grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings , delighted with the affability with which Miss Woodhouse had treated her all the evening , and actually shaken hands with her at last !
It spoke such perfect amity .-- He left them immediately afterwards -- gone in a moment .
Harriet did not consider herself as having any thing to complain of .
He could be no judge , however , of the evil he was holding cheap .
" No trouble in the world , ma ' am ," said the obliging Mrs . Ford .
CHAPTER XVIII
Mrs . Cole was telling that she had been calling on Miss Bates , and as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight of a pianoforte -- a very elegant looking instrument -- not a grand , but a large - sized square pianoforte ; and the substance of the story , the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize , and inquiry , and congratulations on her side , and explanations on Miss Bates ' s , was , that this pianoforte had arrived from Broadwood ' s the day before , to the great astonishment of both aunt and niece -- entirely unexpected ; that at first , by Miss Bates ' s account , Jane herself was quite at a loss , quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it -- but now , they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only one quarter ;-- of course it must be from Colonel Campbell .
" I am very sorry to hear , Miss Fairfax , of your being out this morning in the rain .
Good soul !
Mrs . Weston , did you ever hear the like ?
The rest of the day , the following night , were hardly enough for her thoughts .-- She was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had rushed on her within the last few hours .
" It is so cold , so very cold -- and looks and feels so very much like snow , that if it were to any other place or with any other party , I should really try not to go out to - day -- and dissuade my father from venturing ; but as he has made up his mind , and does not seem to feel the cold himself , I do not like to interfere , as I know it would be so great a disappointment to Mr . and Mrs . Weston .
I am a great advocate for timidity -- and I am sure one does not often meet with it .-- But in those who are at all inferior , it is extremely prepossessing .
" Upon my word , Emma , to hear you abusing the reason you have , is almost enough to make me think so too .
" So prettily done !
But Mr . Elton , in person , had driven away all such cares .
It would be dreadful to be standing so close !
She could not be complying , she dreaded being quarrelsome ; her heroism reached only to silence .
I like her the better for it .
And having gone through what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement , and his persisting to act in direct opposition to Jane Fairfax ' s sense of right , he made a fuller pause to say , " This is very bad .-- He had induced her to place herself , for his sake , in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness , and it should have been his first object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarily .-- She must have had much more to contend with , in carrying on the correspondence , than he could .
She was not thoroughly comfortable herself .
But she had an almost instant doubt of his caring for her as he had done , of his feeling the same tenderness in the same degree .
Do not forget your engagement ."
" I am quite easy on that head ," replied Mrs . Weston .
It had just occurred to Mrs . Weston that Mrs . Elton must be asked to begin the ball ; that she would expect it ; which interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction .-- Emma heard the sad truth with fortitude .
Have patience with me , I shall soon have done .-- She closed with this offer , resolving to break with me entirely , and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again .-- _She_ _felt_ _the_ _engagement_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _source_ _of_ _repentance_ _and_ _misery_ _to_ _each_ : _she_ _dissolved_ _it_ .-- This letter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt ' s death .
She could not bear to see him suffering , to know him fancying himself neglected ; and though her understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the Mr . Knightleys , that when once the event were over , his distress would be soon over too , she hesitated -- she could not proceed .
Understanding and gratification came together .
Do not let us be too solemn on the business .
Mr . Elton looked all alarm on the occasion , as he exclaimed ,
" I do remember it ," cried Emma ; " I perfectly remember it .-- Talking about spruce - beer .-- Oh !
" Oh !
" If I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man , I could have borne any thing .
brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private liking , of private understanding even , between Frank Churchill and Jane .
And it cannot be for the value of our custom now , for what is our consumption of bread , you know ?
The scene enlarged ; two persons appeared ; Mrs . Weston and her son - in - law ; they were walking into Highbury ;-- to Hartfield of course .
The expense shall not be thought of ; and though he is so liberal , and so fond of Jane that I dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance , we could not suffer it to be so , you know .
This is great news , indeed .
" Indeed !
I have not always known their writing apart ."
I am losing all my bitterness against spoilt children , my dearest Emma .
" We will not allow her to do such a thing again :"-- and nodding significantly --" there must be some arrangement made , there must indeed .
Knightley ."
After an interval of some minutes , however , he began with ,
here ' s Miss Woodhouse .-- Dear Miss Woodhouse , how do you do ?-- Very well I thank you , quite well .
She did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the inferiority of her own playing and singing .
When you have been here a little longer , Miss Fairfax , you will understand that Mr . Elton is the standard of perfection in Highbury , both in person and mind ."
Your dear mother was so clever at all those things !
Emma was most agreeably surprized .-- Mr .
You may believe me , Mrs . Weston .
One perplexity , however , arose , which the gentlemen did not disdain .
Be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited .
In short , she sat , during the first visit , looking at Jane Fairfax with twofold complacency ; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering justice , and was determining that she would dislike her no longer .
" Mermaids and sharks !
There was a seriousness in Harriet ' s manner which prepared her , quite as much as her words , for something more than ordinary .
What !-- engaged to her all the winter -- before either of them came to Highbury ?"
said Mr . Weston , looking about .
This has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed .
" You are right .
Harriet listened , and Emma drew in peace .
It was folly to be disturbed by it .
" My dear madam !
" True , true ," cried Mr . Knightley , with most ready interposition -- " very true .
They vindicated him against the base aspersion .
Poor Perry is bilious , and he has not time to take care of himself -- he tells me he has not time to take care of himself -- which is very sad -- but he is always wanted all round the country .
" We cannot suppose ," said Emma , smiling , " that Mr . Elton would hesitate to assure you of there being a _very_ musical society in Highbury ; and I hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be pardoned , in consideration of the motive ."
" Well ;-- if _you_ wish me to stay and join the party , I will ."
It was easy to decide that she was still too young ; and Jane remained with them , sharing , as another daughter , in all the rational pleasures of an elegant society , and a judicious mixture of home and amusement , with only the drawback of the future , the sobering suggestions of her own good understanding to remind her that all this might soon be over .
I think , Miss Woodhouse , you and I must establish a musical club , and have regular weekly meetings at your house , or ours .
It was enough for her to feel .
The invitation was refused , and by a verbal message .
The truth is , Harriet , that my playing is just good enough to be praised , but Jane Fairfax ' s is much beyond it ."
Emma will be happy to entertain you .
