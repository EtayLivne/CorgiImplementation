She had always wanted to do every thing , and had made more progress both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to .
It is impossible to refuse what you ask in such a way .
Some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they walked into Mrs . Weston ' s drawing - room ;-- Mr . Elton must compose his joyous looks , and Mr . John Knightley disperse his ill - humour .
Can I do any thing for you ?"
She then took a longer time for consideration .
She had ventured once alone to Randalls , but it was not pleasant ; and a Harriet Smith , therefore , one whom she could summon at any time to a walk , would be a valuable addition to her privileges .
" I am quite sure ," he replied , speaking very distinctly , " that he told me she had accepted him ; and that there was no obscurity , nothing doubtful , in the words he used ; and I think I can give you a proof that it must be so .
In time , of course , Mr . Knightley would be forgotten , that is , supplanted ; but this could not be expected to happen very early .
Poverty certainly has not contracted her mind : I really believe , if she had only a shilling in the world , she would be very likely to give away sixpence of it ; and nobody is afraid of her : that is a great charm ."
She was ready to tell every thing in her power , but on this subject questions were vain .
Till this year , every long vacation since their marriage had been divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey ; but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea - bathing for the children , and it was therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by their Surry connexions , or seen at all by Mr . Woodhouse , who could not be induced to get so far as London , even for poor Isabella ' s sake ; and who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit .
Harriet blushed and smiled , and said something about wondering that people should like her so much .
There could be no harm in a scheme , a mere passive scheme .
The distressing explanation she had to make to Harriet , and all that poor Harriet would be suffering , with the awkwardness of future meetings , the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance , of subduing feelings , concealing resentment , and avoiding eclat , were enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections some time longer , and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most dreadfully .
He always moved with the alertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory , but now he seemed more sudden than usual in his disappearance .
" Mr . Elton going to be married !"
" Ah !"
said she .-- " The regularity and despatch of it !
one can think of nothing else ."
" When Miss Smiths and Mr . Eltons get acquainted -- they do indeed -- and really it is strange ; it is out of the common course that what is so evidently , so palpably desirable -- what courts the pre - arrangement of other people , should so immediately shape itself into the proper form .
She was , of course , the object of their joint dislike .-- When they had nothing else to say , it must be always easy to begin abusing Miss Woodhouse ; and the enmity which they dared not shew in open disrespect to her , found a broader vent in contemptuous treatment of Harriet .
" I shall never be easy till I have seen some of these places .
Poor Mr . Woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him in the breast of that man whom he was so cordially welcoming , and so anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his ride .-- Could he have seen the heart , he would have cared very little for the lungs ; but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil , without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either , he repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he had received from Mr . Perry , and talked on with much self - contentment , totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him in return .
She could not think that Harriet ' s solace or her own sins required more ; and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned ;-- but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded , and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter , and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive -- " Mr . Elton is so good to the poor !"
He asked me if he could do any thing .
" I would ask for the pleasure of your company , Mr . Knightley , but I am a very slow walker , and my pace would be tedious to you ; and , besides , you have another long walk before you , to Donwell Abbey ."
It was not closed , however , it still remained ajar ; but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation , she hoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the adjoining room .
" Mr . Elton is a very pretty young man , to be sure , and a very good young man , and I have a great regard for him .
cried Harriet indignantly .--" Oh !
She was pleased with the eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan , and travel earlier , later , and quicker , that he might gain half a day .
" But , my dear papa , you are no friend to matrimony ; and therefore why should you be so anxious to pay your respects to a _bride_ ?
Emma had not to listen to such paradings again -- to any so exclusively addressed to herself -- so disgustingly decorated with a " dear Miss Woodhouse ."
It has been so many years my province to give advice , that you cannot be surprized , Mr . Knightley , at this little remains of office ."
" There is one thing , Emma , which a man can always do , if he chuses , and that is , his duty ; not by manoeuvring and finessing , but by vigour and resolution .
Her many beginnings were displayed .
The Coles were very respectable in their way , but they ought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit them .
He is as well acquainted with his own claims , as you can be with Harriet ' s .
" Yes ," said Harriet earnestly , " and well she might , nobody could ever have a better .
" You are silent , Miss Fairfax -- but I hope you mean to take an interest in this news .
You will not be sorry to find yourself at home ."
From our relative situation , those attentions were her due , and were felt to be so .-- Whether Miss Woodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of that fortnight , I cannot say ;-- when I called to take leave of her , I remember that I was within a moment of confessing the truth , and I then fancied she was not without suspicion ; but I have no doubt of her having since detected me , at least in some degree .-- She may not have surmised the whole , but her quickness must have penetrated a part .
" You like it , my Emma , as little as I feared .-- I wish our opinions were the same .
" It was certainly never brilliant , but she would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general ; and there was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face ."
One cannot resolve upon them in a hurry .
She might do very well by herself .
I can only say that there was smoothness outwardly .
Yes , next week .
I have a note of his .-- Do not you remember , Mrs . Weston , employing him to write for you one day ?"
You , ( to Emma ), I am certain , will never guess .-- I will tell you .-- M .
He had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted , and he could sometimes act an ungracious , or say a severe thing .
" Read it , read it ," said he , " it will give you pleasure ; only a few lines -- will not take you long ; read it to Emma ."
Your neighbourhood is increasing , and you mix more with it .
" Poor Mrs . Churchill !
Emma laughed , and replied ,
From Monday next to Saturday , I assure you we have not a disengaged day !-- A woman with fewer resources than I have , need not have been at a loss ."
And I see very few pearls in the room except mine .-- So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer , I understand .-- We shall see if our styles suit .-- A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill .
She felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis , an event , a something to alter her present composed and tranquil state .
His own stomach could bear nothing rich , and he could never believe other people to be different from himself .
I can think of but one thing -- Who is in love with her ?
" Will you read the letter ?"
" Me !-- not at all ," replied Mr . Knightley , rather displeased ; " I do not want to think ill of him .
Time , however , she thought , would tell him that they ought to be friends again .
The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square is very different from almost all the rest .
I had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name , which I was not at all pleased with .
And as it is some months since Miss Campbell married , the impression may be a little worn off ."
It saves trouble , and is a something to get me out .
-- Bad enough as it is , for I absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree .-- I believe I have not played a bar this fortnight .-- However , he is coming , I assure you : yes , indeed , on purpose to wait on you all ."
I admired your spirit ; and I dare say we shall get home very well .
He has a wife and family to maintain , and is not to be giving away his time .
All was safe and prosperous ; and as the removal of one solicitude generally makes way for another , Emma , being now certain of her ball , began to adopt as the next vexation Mr . Knightley ' s provoking indifference about it .
He was a married man , with only one living child , a girl , about Jane ' s age : and Jane became their guest , paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all ; and before she was nine years old , his daughter ' s great fondness for her , and his own wish of being a real friend , united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her education .
The extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or other ."
yes "-- he replied ; " I was just going to mention it .
But you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield .
I cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side ; but I am sure there is a great wish on the Churchills ' to keep him to themselves .
I am thwarted in every thing material .
A glance or two between him and his wife , convinced him that all was as right as this speech proclaimed ; and its happy effect on his spirits was immediate .
Why should he marry ?-- He is as happy as possible by himself ; with his farm , and his sheep , and his library , and all the parish to manage ; and he is extremely fond of his brother ' s children .
I went in for three minutes , and was detained by Miss Bates ' s being absent .
Mr . Woodhouse came in , and very soon led to the subject again , by the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of " Well , my dears , how does your book go on ?-- Have you got any thing fresh ?"
While either of them protected him and his , Hartfield was safe .-- But Mr . John Knightley must be in London again by the end of the first week in November .
She was sure of Mrs . Weston ' s wishing it to be communicated ; especially to one , who , like Mr . Knightley , had seen so much to blame in his conduct .
You are afraid of giving me trouble ; but I assure you , my dear Jane , the Campbells can hardly be more interested about you than I am .
here ' s Miss Woodhouse .-- Dear Miss Woodhouse , how do you do ?-- Very well I thank you , quite well .
no -- far from it -- certainly plain .
Forcing herself to speak , therefore , in the hope of putting it by , she calmly said ,
She was stopped by a slight fit of coughing , and Mr . Weston instantly seized the opportunity of going on .
I only wanted to prove to you that Mrs . S . admits our apology , and is not offended .
Gone to Mr . Woodhouse ' s .
To those who had no resources it was a different thing ; but my resources made me quite independent .
" I am not at all surprized at you , Harriet .
Her father composed himself to sleep after dinner , as usual , and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost .
I could suppose she might in time -- but can she already ?-- Did not you misunderstand him ?-- You were both talking of other things ; of business , shows of cattle , or new drills -- and might not you , in the confusion of so many subjects , mistake him ?-- It was not Harriet ' s hand that he was certain of -- it was the dimensions of some famous ox ."
And he smiled with such seeming pleasure at the conviction , that she must proceed another step .
In the way of love , I am sure he does not .
It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax , whose prospects were closing , while Harriet ' s opened , and whose engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury , who wished to shew her kindness -- and with Emma it was grown into a first wish .
She gained on them , however , involuntarily : the child ' s pace was quick , and theirs rather slow ; and she was the more concerned at it , from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them .
And I need not bring the whole family , you know ."
Such kind friends , you know , Miss Woodhouse , one must always find agreeable , though every body seemed rather fagged after the morning ' s party .
-- was a question , however , which did not augur much .
