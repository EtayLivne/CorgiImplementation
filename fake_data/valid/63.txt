While you were in the smallest degree wavering , I said nothing about it , because I would not influence ; but it would have been the loss of a friend to me .
Composure with a witness !
I see it in her cheek , her smile , her vain attempt to frown .
Her spirits seemed overcome .
Woman ' s usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they are now ; or with no important variation .
This proves that he can leave the Churchills ."
Knightley ."
Mr . Elton must smile less , and Mr . John Knightley more , to fit them for the place .-- Emma only might be as nature prompted , and shew herself just as happy as she was .
" That I am sure you would .
He is generally thought a fine young man , but do not expect a prodigy .
She will not even listen to your questions .
I leave you to your own reflections ."
Harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party .
" You are so noble in your ideas !"
She was obliged to repeat and explain it , before it was fully comprehended ; and then , being quite new , farther representations were necessary to make it acceptable .
" Oh !
It was precisely what Emma would have wished , had she deemed it possible enough for wishing .
" My dear Jane , say no more about it .
He looked rather doubtingly -- rather confused ; said something about " honour ,"-- glanced at Emma and at Harriet , and then seeing the book open on the table , took it up , and examined it very attentively .
" My poor dear Harriet !
He was on foot , and after looking very respectfully at her , looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion .
He ought to have opposed the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father .
Such a heart -- such a Harriet !
There was a seriousness in Harriet ' s manner which prepared her , quite as much as her words , for something more than ordinary .
" On the misery of what she had suffered , during the concealment of so many months ," continued Mrs . Weston , " she was energetic .
you are not serious now .
These amazing engagements of mine -- what have they been ?
Her gestures and movements might be understood by any one who looked on like Emma ; but her words , every body ' s words , were soon lost under the incessant flow of Miss Bates , who came in talking , and had not finished her speech under many minutes after her being admitted into the circle at the fire .
There were three others , Jane says , which they hesitated about some time .
I was sixteen years old when you were born ."
Donwell and Randalls had received their invitation , and none had come for her father and herself ; and Mrs . Weston ' s accounting for it with " I suppose they will not take the liberty with you ; they know you do not dine out ," was not quite sufficient .
such an aunt !"
It was a melancholy change ; and Emma could not but sigh over it , and wish for impossible things , till her father awoke , and made it necessary to be cheerful .
It was on the wedding - day of this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance .
Yes , good man !-- thought Emma -- but what has all that to do with taking likenesses ?
She had talked her into love ; but , alas !
Yes , I am sure you are much too reasonable .
I behaved shamefully .
I always make a point of reading Jane ' s letters through to myself first , before I read them aloud to my mother , you know , for fear of there being any thing in them to distress her .
The most satisfactory comparisons were rising in her mind .
I never was more surprized -- but it does not make me unhappy , I assure you .-- How -- how has it been possible ?"
" Yes ," said he , smiling --" and reason good .
I told you that I did not wonder at your attachment ; that considering the service he had rendered you , it was extremely natural :-- and you agreed to it , expressing yourself very warmly as to your sense of that service , and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing him come forward to your rescue .-- The impression of it is strong on my memory ."
If Mr . Knightley did not begin seriously , he was obliged to proceed so , for his proposal was caught at with delight ; and the " Oh !
There are secrets in all families , you know )-- The case is , that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in January ; and that Frank ' s coming depends upon their being put off .
It did assist ; for though he began with grave looks and short questions , he was soon led on to talk of them all in the usual way , and to take the child out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity .
Never had she felt so agitated , mortified , grieved , at any circumstance in her life .
Harriet was remembered only from being _her_ friend .
-- What does this mean ?
And here I can admit , that my manners to Miss W ., in being unpleasant to Miss F ., were highly blameable .
She merely said , in the course of some trivial chat , " Well , Harriet , whenever you marry I would advise you to do so and so "-- and thought no more of it , till after a minute ' s silence she heard Harriet say in a very serious tone , " I shall never marry ."
Quite thick shoes .
He had business at the Crown about his hay , and a great many errands for Mrs . Weston at Ford ' s , but he need not hurry any body else ."
" I should not have thought it possible ," she began , " that you could have misunderstood me !
Delightful , charming , superior , first circles , spheres , lines , ranks , every thing -- and Mrs . Elton was wild to have the offer closed with immediately .-- On her side , all was warmth , energy , and triumph -- and she positively refused to take her friend ' s negative , though Miss Fairfax continued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing , repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before .-- Still Mrs . Elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence by the morrow ' s post .-- How Jane could bear it at all , was astonishing to Emma .-- She did look vexed , she did speak pointedly -- and at last , with a decision of action unusual to her , proposed a removal .-- " Should not they walk ?
Elton was sitting here , I remember , much about where I am now ."
No second meeting had there yet been between him and Emma .
The bustle and joy of such an arrival , the many to be talked to , welcomed , encouraged , and variously dispersed and disposed of , produced a noise and confusion which his nerves could not have borne under any other cause , nor have endured much longer even for this ; but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her father were so respected by Mrs . John Knightley , that in spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her little ones , and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance , all the eating and drinking , and sleeping and playing , which they could possibly wish for , without the smallest delay , the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him , either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them .
The kind - hearted , polite old man might then sit down and feel that he had done his duty , and made every fair lady welcome and easy .
" Ah !
From Monday next to Saturday , I assure you we have not a disengaged day !-- A woman with fewer resources than I have , need not have been at a loss ."
Oh !-- you need not be afraid of owning it to me , for Mr . Weston has told me himself .
It was a sweet view -- sweet to the eye and the mind .
Frank ' s mother would never have been slighted as she was but for her .
" Has your son been with you , then ?"
She longed for the serenity they might gradually introduce ; and on Mr . Perry ' s coming in soon after dinner , with a disengaged hour to give her father , she lost no time ill hurrying into the shrubbery .-- There , with spirits freshened , and thoughts a little relieved , she had taken a few turns , when she saw Mr . Knightley passing through the garden door , and coming towards her .-- It was the first intimation of his being returned from London .
It is impossible ."
Mr . Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young farmer out of Harriet ' s head .
She is not a sensible girl , nor a girl of any information .
Mr . Elton was to take the drawing to London , chuse the frame , and give the directions ; and Emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him , while he seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough .
He said no more .
She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate , indulgent father ; and had , in consequence of her sister ' s marriage , been mistress of his house from a very early period .
I will keep my ill - humour to myself .
You did not enjoy them as I did ; you appeared tired the whole time .
They must be separated ; but there was a great deal of pain in the process -- so much to herself at this time , that she soon felt the necessity of a little consolation , and resolved on going home by way of Randalls to procure it .
But is it possible that you had no suspicion ?-- I mean of late .
poor Jane is ill !'
You are always with me ."
It appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature .
said he , ` I do think I can fasten the rivet ; I like a job of this kind excessively .'
That ' s right .
The difference which Randalls , Randalls alone makes in your goings - on , is very great ."
But on seeing them together , she became perfectly satisfied .
Such an end of the doleful disappointment of five weeks back !
While you considered me as having sinned against Emma Woodhouse , I could deserve nothing from either .
He was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing else -- which is just as it should be , for a thriving man .
I have already met with such success in two applications for pardon , that I may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours , and of those among your friends who have had any ground of offence .-- You must all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when I first arrived at Randalls ; you must consider me as having a secret which was to be kept at all hazards .
I can allow for the fears of the child , but not of the man .
And I will own to you , ( I am sure it will be safe ), that so far as our living with Mr . Churchill at Enscombe , it is settled .
I am here till claimed by Colonel and Mrs .
Emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour .
He knew of no one but Mrs . Goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or friends .
This had happened the year before .
-- But Mrs . Elton was very much discomposed indeed .--" Poor Knightley !
I knew you would wish it .
When she took in her history , indeed , her situation , as well as her beauty ; when she considered what all this elegance was destined to , what she was going to sink from , how she was going to live , it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect ; especially , if to every well - known particular entitling her to interest , were added the highly probable circumstance of an attachment to Mr . Dixon , which she had so naturally started to herself .
She is not a sensible girl , nor a girl of any information .
This was Colonel Campbell , who had very highly regarded Fairfax , as an excellent officer and most deserving young man ; and farther , had been indebted to him for such attentions , during a severe camp - fever , as he believed had saved his life .
She seemed bent on giving no real insight into Mr . Dixon ' s character , or her own value for his company , or opinion of the suitableness of the match .
" You cannot do better , sir ."
