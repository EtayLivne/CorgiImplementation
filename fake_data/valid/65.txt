Mr . Woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused .
On that article , truth seemed attainable .
Then , he said , he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day ."
I have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure .
" He had just looked into the dining - room , and as he was not wanted there , preferred being out of doors ."
She saw that Enscombe could not satisfy , and that Highbury , taken at its best , might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement at home than he liked .
She heard Miss Bates ' s voice , something was to be done in a hurry ; the maid looked frightened and awkward ; hoped she would be pleased to wait a moment , and then ushered her in too soon .
He sat by her at dinner .
and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things ?"
Such an immense plantation all round it !
Mrs . Weston looked up , afraid to believe ; but Emma ' s countenance was as steady as her words .
She would not look again .
I am sure they will bring him soon ."
It was not in his calmness that she read his comparative difference .
" Ill , very ill -- that is , if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill .
But neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once , and Emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time .
They were interrupted .
He had seen the coachmen , and they both agreed with him in there being nothing to apprehend .
You may be very sure that if I had , I should have cautioned you accordingly ."
She hoped they might now become friends again .
" I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome ."
" By all means , if you can ."
I cannot keep my eyes from it .
She supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his clemency ; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in his opinion .
I am exceedingly sorry : but it is well that the mistake ends where it does .
Is not she an angel in every gesture ?
But take it away , and all _appropriation_ ceases , and a very pretty gallant charade remains , fit for any collection .
The persons to be invited , required little thought .
I am always watching her to admire ; and I do pity her from my heart ."
She must be collected and calm .
it was such an inexpressible obligation !-- The very recollection of it , and all that I felt at the time -- when I saw him coming -- his noble look -- and my wretchedness before .
" But it is too far , indeed it is , to be walking quite alone .
To take a dislike to a young man , only because he appeared to be of a different disposition from himself , was unworthy the real liberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him ; for with all the high opinion of himself , which she had often laid to his charge , she had never before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust to the merit of another .
" And when she had come away , Mrs . Martin was so very kind as to send Mrs . Goddard a beautiful goose -- the finest goose Mrs . Goddard had ever seen .
She was quite convinced of Mr . Elton ' s being in the fairest way of falling in love , if not in love already .
I have spent so many happy months there !
Good old Mrs . Bates -- I will call upon her to - morrow , and take my children .-- They are always so pleased to see my children .-- And that excellent Miss Bates !-- such thorough worthy people !-- How are they , sir ?"
You have shewn that you can dance , and you know we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper ."
To Isabella , the relief of such tidings was very great , and they were scarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father ' s account , who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous constitution allowed ; but the alarm that had been raised could not be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at Randalls .
Oh !
One is sick of the very name of Jane Fairfax .
Proportions , fore - shortening .-- Oh no !
Such a friend as Mrs . Weston was out of the question .
The consciousness of having done amiss , had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes , and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been -- that had been -- hard for him to bear .
" Where is the young man ?"
Resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father , from which she was so pointedly excluded .
The circumstance was told him at Hartfield ; for the moment , he was silent ; but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself , over a newspaper he held in his hand , " Hum !
Harriet , who had been standing in no unhappy reverie , was yet very glad to be called from it , by the now encouraging manner of such a judge , and such a friend as Miss Woodhouse , and only wanted invitation , to give the history of her hopes with great , though trembling delight .-- Emma ' s tremblings as she asked , and as she listened , were better concealed than Harriet ' s , but they were not less .
It may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to be understood .
" Pray take care , Mrs . Weston , there is a step at the turning .
" Well , well , means to make her an offer then .
Mr . Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea ; and when he had drank his tea he was quite ready to go home ; and it was as much as his three companions could do , to entertain away his notice of the lateness of the hour , before the other gentlemen appeared .
Mr . Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile ; and succeeded without difficulty , upon Mrs . Elton ' s beginning to talk to him .
After a good many compliments to Jane on her dress and look , compliments very quietly and properly taken , Mrs . Elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself -- and it was , " How do you like my gown ?-- How do you like my trimming ?-- How has Wright done my hair ?"
She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to - day , and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore throat herself .
Mr . Elton was so hot and tired , that all this wit seemed thrown away .
Harriet had no penetration .
His company so sought after , that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it ; that he has more invitations than there are days in the week .
It was a palpable display , repeated on every possible occasion .
She could not speak another word .-- Her voice was lost ; and she sat down , waiting in great terror till Harriet should answer .
Man ' s boasted power and freedom , all are flown ; Lord of the earth and sea , he bends a slave , And woman , lovely woman , reigns alone .
" Those who knew any thing about it , must have felt the difference .
According to Miss Bates -- it all came from her -- Mrs . Dixon had written most pressingly .
" Yes , she would be , but that she thinks there will be another put - off .
" There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all --" he began rather quickly , but checking himself , added , " however , it is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were -- how it might all be behind the scenes .
Emma wondered on what , of all the medley , she would fix .
said Emma again .
said he with a tender sigh , as he received it .
" I cannot think there is any danger of it ," was Emma ' s calm answer -- " and when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax ' s situation and understand what her home has been , with Colonel and Mrs . Campbell , I have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown ."
Campbell ."
No , Emma , your amiable young man can be amiable only in French , not in English .
She had never been quite well since the time of their daughter ' s marriage ; and till she should have completely recovered her usual strength , they must forbid her engaging in duties , which , so far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits , seemed , under the most favourable circumstances , to require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with tolerable comfort .
a fine complimentary opening : But it is his way .
No , she had heard from him very lately , but having answered the letter , had put it away .
It confesses that you have long understood me ."
I consider one as including the other .
I do not pretend to it .
Depend upon it , that was the case : and very likely to happen with the Donwell servants , who are all , I have often observed , extremely awkward and remiss .-- I am sure I would not have such a creature as his Harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration .
" Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills , I fancy ," observed Mr . John Knightley coolly .
Resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father , from which she was so pointedly excluded .
Their road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane , a lane leading at right angles from the broad , though irregular , main street of the place ; and , as may be inferred , containing the blessed abode of Mr . Elton .
" Do you dare to suppose me so great a blockhead , as not to know what a man is talking of ?-- What do you deserve ?"
It was not unlikely , she thought , that she might see Mr . Knightley in her way ; or , perhaps , he might come in while she were paying her visit .
Mr . Perry could not quite understand him , but he was very sure there must be a _lady_ in the case , and he told him so ; and Mr . Elton only looked very conscious and smiling , and rode off in great spirits .
" If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women , and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with them , as you are where these children are concerned , we might always think alike ."
Mrs . Elton was first seen at church : but though devotion might be interrupted , curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew , and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid , to settle whether she were very pretty indeed , or only rather pretty , or not pretty at all .
When first sounded on the subject , he was so miserable , that they were almost hopeless .-- A second allusion , indeed , gave less pain .-- He began to think it was to be , and that he could not prevent it -- a very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation .
Very odd !
And as to its recommendations to _you_ , I fancy I need not take much pains to dwell on them .
" I shall never be invited to Abbey - Mill again ," was said in rather a sorrowful tone .
She had frequently thought -- especially since his father ' s marriage with Miss Taylor -- that if she _were_ to marry , he was the very person to suit her in age , character and condition .
As I tell Mr . E ., you are a thorough humourist .-- Yes , believe me , Knightley , I am fully sensible of your attention to me in the whole of this scheme .
"-- Mrs . Weston , I suppose ," interrupted Mrs . Elton , rather mortified .
I want you to save yourself from greater pain .
She loves piquet , you know ; but when she is gone home , I am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself , instead of going to bed at your usual time -- and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort .
I am sure they will like her extremely ; and when she gets a little acquainted with them , her fears will completely wear off , for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliating .-- I shall have her very often indeed while they are with me , and I dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her in the barouche - landau in some of our exploring parties ."
" I am very sure that I never said any thing of either to the other , which both might not have heard ."
If you need farther explanation , I have the honour , my dear madam , of being your husband ' s son , and the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good , which no inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value of .-- See me , then , under these circumstances , arriving on my first visit to Randalls ;-- and here I am conscious of wrong , for that visit might have been sooner paid .
You will never go to Swisserland .
She hardly knew yet what Mr . Knightley would ask ; but a very short parley with her own heart produced the most solemn resolution of never quitting her father .-- She even wept over the idea of it , as a sin of thought .
