" How ?-- They were invited , were not they ?"
He might observe that it was so .
He is so very superior .
He must do it all himself .
she cried with more thorough gaiety , " if you fancy your brother does not do me justice , only wait till my dear father is in the secret , and hear his opinion .
I do not say when , but perhaps you may guess where ;-- in the building in which N . takes M . for better , for worse ."
" I am glad I have done being in love with him .
" It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer -- but it seems a case of necessity .
He was giving Harriet information as to modes of agriculture , etc .
CHAPTER II
Frank ' s was the first idea ; and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it ; for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties , and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance .
As Harriet now lived , the Martins could not get at her , without seeking her , where hitherto they had wanted either the courage or the condescension to seek her ; for since her refusal of the brother , the sisters never had been at Mrs . Goddard ' s ; and a twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again , with any necessity , or even any power of speech .
" To be sure .
But then , Mrs . Goddard will want to see it .-- And I could take the pattern gown home any day .
Mr . Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade .
.
Mrs . Elton was very much disappointed .
The first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to attend , was the name of Jane Fairfax .
interrupted Emma , " there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over .
He sat musing a little while , and then said ,
with the help of spectacles .
she was as grateful as possible , you may be sure .
He could be no judge , however , of the evil he was holding cheap .
The present crisis , indeed , seemed to be brought on by them ; and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct ."
When you have been here a little longer , Miss Fairfax , you will understand that Mr . Elton is the standard of perfection in Highbury , both in person and mind ."
In her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her .
Every body who sees it is struck by its beauty ; but to me , it has been quite a home .
of what sort ?"
Let me not suppose that she dares go about , Emma Woodhouse - ing me !-- But upon my honour , there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman ' s tongue !"
The result of this distress was , that , with a much more voluntary , cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the moment , she was able to fix her wedding - day -- and Mr . Elton was called on , within a month from the marriage of Mr . and Mrs . Robert Martin , to join the hands of Mr . Knightley and Miss Woodhouse .
She went , however ; and when they reached the farm , and she was to be put down , at the end of the broad , neat gravel walk , which led between espalier apple - trees to the front door , the sight of every thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before , was beginning to revive a little local agitation ; and when they parted , Emma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity , which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour .
You will never go to Swisserland .
" Has he been here on this occasion -- or has he not ?"
And ever since she was twelve , Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all .
she found something else must be done .
You and Miss Smith , and Miss Fairfax , will be three , and the two Miss Coxes five ; and for five couple there will be plenty of room ."
I do not by any means engage for its being returned .
" I do not think he is conceited either , in general ," said Harriet , her conscience opposing such censure ; " at least , he is very good natured , and I shall always feel much obliged to him , and have a great regard for -- but that is quite a different thing from -- and you know , though he may like me , it does not follow that I should -- and certainly I must confess that since my visiting here I have seen people -- and if one comes to compare them , person and manners , there is no comparison at all , _one_ is so very handsome and agreeable .
Remember how few minutes I was at Randalls , and in how bewildered , how mad a state : and I am not much better yet ; still insane either from happiness or misery .
Exquisite , quite exquisite !-- Still , however , having proceeded so far , one is unwilling to give the matter up .
There are people , who the more you do for them , the less they will do for themselves .
The prospect before her now , was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled -- that might not be even partially brightened .
But I shall always think it a very abominable sort of proceeding .
He came four times a day for a week .
" These matters are always a secret , till it is found out that every body knows them .
Dixon ."
I am sure she does .
" Oh !
Mr . Weston must be between forty and fifty ."
He contrived that she should be seated by him ; and was sufficiently employed in looking out the best baked apple for her , and trying to make her help or advise him in his work , till Jane Fairfax was quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again .
" There it is .
I mean in person -- tall , and with that sort of look -- and not very talkative ."
Good Heavens !-- What can be to be _broke_ to me , that does not relate to one of that family ?"
The first error and the worst lay at her door .
The quiet , heart - felt satisfaction of the old lady , and the rapturous delight of her daughter -- who proved even too joyous to talk as usual , had been a gratifying , yet almost an affecting , scene .
Mr . Elton looked all happiness at this proposition ; and nothing could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage .
Fairfax of the _______ regiment of infantry , and Miss Jane Bates , had had its day of fame and pleasure , hope and interest ; but nothing now remained of it , save the melancholy remembrance of him dying in action abroad -- of his widow sinking under consumption and grief soon afterwards -- and this girl .
" My dearest Harriet !"
However , the very same evening William Larkins came over with a large basket of apples , the same sort of apples , a bushel at least , and I was very much obliged , and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said every thing , as you may suppose .
As Harriet described it , there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour .
Go and eat and drink a little more , and you will do very well .
His first proposition and request , that the dance begun at Mr . Cole ' s should be finished there -- that the same party should be collected , and the same musician engaged , met with the readiest acquiescence .
" He had just looked into the dining - room , and as he was not wanted there , preferred being out of doors ."
By that time , it was beginning to hold up , and I was determined that nothing should stop me from getting away -- and then -- only think !-- I found he was coming up towards me too -- slowly you know , and as if he did not quite know what to do ; and so he came and spoke , and I answered -- and I stood for a minute , feeling dreadfully , you know , one can ' t tell how ; and then I took courage , and said it did not rain , and I must go ; and so off I set ; and I had not got three yards from the door , when he came after me , only to say , if I was going to Hartfield , he thought I had much better go round by Mr . Cole ' s stables , for I should find the near way quite floated by this rain .
" Oh , dear ," cried Harriet , " now I recollect what you mean ; but I was thinking of something very different at the time .
asked Mrs .
" I should hope not ; but really when I look around among my acquaintance , I tremble .
It was better to pay my visit , then "--
The contrast between Mrs . Churchill ' s importance in the world , and Jane Fairfax ' s , struck her ; one was every thing , the other nothing -- and she sat musing on the difference of woman ' s destiny , and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed , till roused by Miss Bates ' s saying ,
I do not see it ."
Emma could not forgive her ;-- but as neither provocation nor resentment were discerned by Mr . Knightley , who had been of the party , and had seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side , he was expressing the next morning , being at Hartfield again on business with Mr . Woodhouse , his approbation of the whole ; not so openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room , but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to Emma .
" The joke ," he replied gravely , " seemed confined to you and Mr .
" There is so pointed , and so particular a meaning in this compliment ," said she , " that I cannot have a doubt as to Mr . Elton ' s intentions .
While waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off , Emma found time , in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her voice and her taste , to look about , and see what became of Mr . Knightley .
" There is nothing to be compared to it .
A few minutes were sufficient for making her acquainted with her own heart .
As he became rational , he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in their authority .
" About Jane Fairfax .
There was no denying that those brothers had penetration .
She could see nothing but evil in it .
It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were at Hartfield , which made their presence so acceptable ; for though her first remark , on reading it , was that " of course it must be declined ," she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do , that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful .
" It was her very particular friend , you know ."
Mr . Elton made his appearance .
The refreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary .
However , it was an exceeding good , pretty letter , and gave Mr . and Mrs . Weston a great deal of pleasure .
There probably _was_ something more to conceal than her own preference ; Mr . Dixon , perhaps , had been very near changing one friend for the other , or been fixed only to Miss Campbell , for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds .
where shall we sit ?
and very much to the purpose .
" Oh !
" Mrs . Gilbert does not mean to dance , but there is a young lady disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing -- Miss Smith ."
Emma could not help laughing as she answered , " Upon my word , I believe you know her quite as well as I do .-- But , Mr . Knightley , are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright _accepted_ him .
A little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear .
I dare say they often think of you , and wonder which will be the day , the precise day of the instrument ' s coming to hand .
Emma turned away her head , divided between tears and smiles .
I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill ; when , provoked by such conduct on my side , such shameful , insolent neglect of her , and such apparent devotion to Miss W ., as it would have been impossible for any woman of sense to endure , she spoke her resentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me .-- In short , my dear madam , it was a quarrel blameless on her side , abominable on mine ; and I returned the same evening to Richmond , though I might have staid with you till the next morning , merely because I would be as angry with her as possible .
She doubted whether she had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman , in betraying her suspicions of Jane Fairfax ' s feelings to Frank Churchill .
" As to that -- I do not --"
that is quite -- I suppose there never was a piece of news more generally interesting .
so silly -- so satisfied -- so smiling -- so prosing -- so undistinguishing and unfastidious -- and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me , I would marry to - morrow .
But while I visit at Hartfield , and you are so kind to me , Miss Woodhouse , I am not afraid of what any body can do ."
