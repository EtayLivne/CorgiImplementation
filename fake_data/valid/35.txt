His eldest daughter ' s alarm was equal to his own .
Indeed , when the time draws on , I shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche - landau ; it will be so very much preferable .
With all the eagerness which such a transition gives , Emma resolved to be out of doors as soon as possible .
The compliment was just returned , coldly and proudly ; and , under indescribable irritation of spirits , she was then conveyed to Hartfield .
Every body was punctual , every body in their best looks : not a tear , and hardly a long face to be seen .
Humph -- Harriet ' s ready wit !
I do not care for myself .
poor fellow !-- sad business for him .-- She was extremely concerned ; for , though very eccentric , he had a thousand good qualities .-- How could he be so taken in ?-- Did not think him at all in love -- not in the least .-- Poor Knightley !-- There would be an end of all pleasant intercourse with him .-- How happy he had been to come and dine with them whenever they asked him !
I was ready to have gone with her , but this will do just as well .
CHAPTER IX
What is right to be done cannot be done too soon .
" I have some hope ," resumed he , " of my uncle ' s being persuaded to pay a visit at Randalls ; he wants to be introduced to her .
Could she have chosen with whom to associate , she would not have chosen her .
no -- I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it .
The day approached , the day arrived ; and after a morning of some anxious watching , Frank Churchill , in all the certainty of his own self , reached Randalls before dinner , and every thing was safe .
It was a concern which brought just employment enough .
This was the amount of the whole story ,-- of his communication and of Harriet ' s as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech .-- He dared not stay longer than to see her well ; these several delays left him not another minute to lose ; and Emma engaging to give assurance of her safety to Mrs . Goddard , and notice of there being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to Mr . Knightley , he set off , with all the grateful blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself .
But poor Mrs . Bates had a bad cold about a month ago ."
" I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between them -- certain expressive looks , which I did not believe meant to be public ."
of Mr .
Emma was sorry ;-- to have to pay civilities to a person she did not like through three long months !-- to be always doing more than she wished , and less than she ought !
She could then see more and judge better .
.
Mr . Churchill ' s loss would be dreadful indeed .
To Highbury in general it brought no material change .
" But what are you in doubt of ?
Oh !
Two or three more of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them , and it was to be done in a quiet , unpretending , elegant way , infinitely superior to the bustle and preparation , the regular eating and drinking , and picnic parade of the Eltons and the Sucklings .
After much thinking , she could determine on nothing better , than Harriet ' s returning the visit ; but in a way that , if they had understanding , should convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance .
It was quite a chance , he said , that he had not gone round by Randalls .
They had music ; Emma was obliged to play ; and the thanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour , an air of greatness , meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very superior performance .
" So unreasonably early !"
They are but too apt to give up music ."
He was arm - in - arm with Mr .
I am here till claimed by Colonel and Mrs .
Perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her inferior in talent , and all the elegancies of mind .
" Well , Mrs . Weston ," said Emma triumphantly when he left them , " what do you say now to Mr . Knightley ' s marrying Jane Fairfax ?"
At the same time , nobody could wonder if Mr . Elton should have aspired -- Miss Woodhouse lets me chatter on , so good - humouredly .
Time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circle -- but that is not the change I had in view for you .
Vanity , extravagance , love of change , restlessness of temper , which must be doing something , good or bad ; heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs . Weston , indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general ; he became liable to all these charges .
Considering the very particular friendship between her and Mrs . Dixon , you could hardly have expected her to be excused from accompanying Colonel and Mrs .
-- and as clearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth .
" I do not think it _is_ so very small .
Her approbation , at once general and minute , warm and incessant , could not but please ; and for another half - hour they were all walking to and fro , between the different rooms , some suggesting , some attending , and all in happy enjoyment of the future .
Elton , before she could be spoken to , was ready ; and before Mr . Woodhouse had reached her with his request to be allowed to hand her into the dining - parlour , was saying --
She was not a woman of strong understanding or any quickness ; and with this resemblance of her father , she inherited also much of his constitution ; was delicate in her own health , over - careful of that of her children , had many fears and many nerves , and was as fond of her own Mr . Wingfield in town as her father could be of Mr . Perry .
when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of court - plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about !
There was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry , not so leniently disposed .
" You may depend upon me ," said she .
" I am very much obliged to you ," said Emma , laughing again .
I remember saying to myself , ` Even Emma , with all her partiality for Harriet , will think this a good match .'"
Miss Fairfax , who had seldom spoken before , except among her own confederates , spoke now .
At first it was downright dulness to Emma .
That ' s right .
No invitation came amiss to her .
How improperly had she been acting by Harriet !
" We consider our Hartfield pork ," replied Mr . Woodhouse --" indeed it certainly is , so very superior to all other pork , that Emma and I cannot have a greater pleasure than --"
As an old friend , you will allow me to hope , Miss Fairfax , that ten years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as I have ."
I am sure they were talking of me ; and I could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me --( do you think he was , Miss Woodhouse ?)
" Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment ."
" Nor , if you were , could I ever bear to part with you , my Harriet .
South End is prohibited , if you please .
Do you think it is a good one ?
Nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible .
You provide for the family , you know , ( with a smile at his father ).
" It is as well , perhaps , that I have not had the possibility .
The tone implied some old acquaintance -- and how could she possibly guess ?
This would not do ; she immediately stopped , under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing of her half - boot , and stooping down in complete occupation of the footpath , begged them to have the goodness to walk on , and she would follow in half a minute .
The affection of such a man as Mr . Elton would have been too great a distinction .-- She never could have deserved him -- and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse would have thought it possible .
To look at her , nobody would think how delighted and happy she is to have secured such a situation .
replied Miss Bates .
" Business , you know , may bring money , but friendship hardly ever does ."
And it always ended in " Kitty , a fair but frozen maid ."
I give you notice -- You will find me a formidable antagonist on that point .
Mr . and Mrs . Elton appeared ; and all the smiles and the proprieties passed .
Contrary to the usual course of things , Mr . Elton ' s wanting to pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion .
" I do not consider its length as particularly in its favour .
After another short hesitation , " I hope it does not proceed from -- I hope it is not in compliment to Mr .
" And when ," thought Emma , " will there be a beginning of Mr .
" Ah !
Upon these occasions , a lady ' s character generally precedes her ; and Highbury has long known that you are a superior performer ."
Circumstances that might swell to half an hour ' s relation , and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them , had passed undiscerned by her who now heard them ; but the two latest occurrences to be mentioned , the two of strongest promise to Harriet , were not without some degree of witness from Emma herself .-- The first , was his walking with her apart from the others , in the lime - walk at Donwell , where they had been walking some time before Emma came , and he had taken pains ( as she was convinced ) to draw her from the rest to himself -- and at first , he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done before , in a very particular way indeed !--( Harriet could not recall it without a blush .)
Till now that she was threatened with its loss , Emma had never known how much of her happiness depended on being _first_ with Mr . Knightley , first in interest and affection .-- Satisfied that it was so , and feeling it her due , she had enjoyed it without reflection ; and only in the dread of being supplanted , found how inexpressibly important it had been .-- Long , very long , she felt she had been first ; for , having no female connexions of his own , there had been only Isabella whose claims could be compared with hers , and she had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed Isabella .
" Me !-- oh !
Mr . Elton was still talking , still engaged in some interesting detail ; and Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday ' s party at his friend Cole ' s , and that she was come in herself for the Stilton cheese , the north Wiltshire , the butter , the cellery , the beet - root , and all the dessert .
Observe the turn of her throat .
Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home , and thought this the best offer she was likely to have ."
and once Henry asked me for a knife , but I told him knives were only made for grandpapas .
" Yes , to be sure , I suppose there are .
" Aye , very true .
What has he been judging by ?-- I am not conscious of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this time for my marrying any more than at another .-- But it was so , I suppose .
Every body was punctual , every body in their best looks : not a tear , and hardly a long face to be seen .
" No , sir ," cried Emma , " it confesses no such thing .
Knightley is quite the gentleman .
poor woman , who would have thought it !"
If Frank Churchill had wanted to see his father , he would have contrived it between September and January .
The power of observation would be soon given -- frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in one course .
She opened the parlour door , and saw two gentlemen sitting with her father -- Mr . Weston and his son .
She came solitarily down the gravel walk -- a Miss Martin just appearing at the door , and parting with her seemingly with ceremonious civility .
" I like your plan ," cried Mr . Weston .
