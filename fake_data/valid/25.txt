" Very nicely dressed , indeed ; a remarkably elegant gown ."
said Mrs . Weston , " have not you finished it yet ?
I have done very little ."
She has talked of it since .
The very next day however produced some proof of inspiration .
Her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do ; and at eighteen or nineteen she was , as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children , fully competent to the office of instruction herself ; but she was too much beloved to be parted with .
" Much , indeed !"
Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr . Elton ' s having dropt a hint .
Mrs . Bates was engaged to spend the evening at Hartfield , James had due notice , and he sanguinely hoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear little John would have any thing the matter with them , while dear Emma were gone .
The power of observation would be soon given -- frightfully soon it appeared when her thoughts were in one course .
said she ; ` well , that is quite unexpected .
If you need farther explanation , I have the honour , my dear madam , of being your husband ' s son , and the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good , which no inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value of .-- See me , then , under these circumstances , arriving on my first visit to Randalls ;-- and here I am conscious of wrong , for that visit might have been sooner paid .
How delightful !"
Every thing that I have said or done , for many weeks past , has been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself .
a fine complimentary opening : But it is his way .
Emma laughed , and replied ,
I do not know what she meant , but she asked me if I thought I should go and stay there again next summer ."
Fairfax of the _______ regiment of infantry , and Miss Jane Bates , had had its day of fame and pleasure , hope and interest ; but nothing now remained of it , save the melancholy remembrance of him dying in action abroad -- of his widow sinking under consumption and grief soon afterwards -- and this girl .
When they all sat down it was better ; to her taste a great deal better , for Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay , making her his first object .
Now , an attachment to Harriet Smith would have nothing to encounter .
but those two lines are "--
" I know there is such an idea with many people , but indeed it is quite a mistake , sir .-- We all had our health perfectly well there , never found the least inconvenience from the mud ; and Mr . Wingfield says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy ; and I am sure he may be depended on , for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air , and his own brother and family have been there repeatedly ."
He presently added , with a smile ,
" You are better placed _here_ ; very fit for a wife , but not at all for a governess .
Poor Miss Bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated , in spite of the very natural wish of a little change ."
Let us make the best of it -- and , indeed , almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour .
I will bring friends with me ."
Do not you see that , at this instant , the very passage of her own letter , which sent me the report , is passing under her eye -- that the whole blunder is spread before her -- that she can attend to nothing else , though pretending to listen to the others ?"
They had been meeting almost every day since his arrival .
She proved to be the daughter of a tradesman , rich enough to afford her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers , and decent enough to have always wished for concealment .-- Such was the blood of gentility which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for !-- It was likely to be as untainted , perhaps , as the blood of many a gentleman : but what a connexion had she been preparing for Mr . Knightley -- or for the Churchills -- or even for Mr .
" Ah !-- well -- to be sure .
The quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for Mr . Woodhouse , who had often been distressed by the more animated sort , which Mr . Weston had occasionally introduced , and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting , with tender melancholy , over the departure of the " poor little boys ," or in fondly pointing out , as he took up any stray letter near him , how beautifully Emma had written it .
say beautiful rather .
Time passed on .
Perry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon South End ."
In one moment such a change !
Oh !
Miss Nash had told her all this , and had talked a great deal more about Mr . Elton ; and said , looking so very significantly at her , " that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be , but she only knew that any woman whom Mr . Elton could prefer , she should think the luckiest woman in the world ; for , beyond a doubt , Mr . Elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness ."
" Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming , Miss Woodhouse .-- I quite rave about Jane Fairfax .-- A sweet , interesting creature .
There he had not always the patience that could have been wished .
Miss Woodhouse , do you think we shall ever find it out ?"
Miss Churchill , however , being of age , and with the full command of her fortune -- though her fortune bore no proportion to the family - estate -- was not to be dissuaded from the marriage , and it took place , to the infinite mortification of Mr . and Mrs . Churchill , who threw her off with due decorum .
Miss Woodhouse , I am quite concerned , I am sure you hit your foot .
I want to have your opinion of her looks .
Something of a very unpleasant nature , I find , has occurred ;-- do let me know directly what it is .
Well , ( smiling ,) I hope it may be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers , it has done all that is truly important .
But her account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed , she is so very reserved , so very unwilling to give the least information about any body , that I really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her ."
She must understand you ."
We really are so shocked !
We had great amusement with those letters one morning .
said she , " I get quite anxious about you .
Two steps , Jane , take care of the two steps .
He seemed to me very well off as he was .
" Oh !
He had expressed himself as to coming , with more than common certainty .
Every possibility of good was before me , and the first of blessings secured , in obtaining her promises of faith and correspondence .
I cannot keep my eyes from it .
" Yes , that of course ."
" Thank you , but I would rather you did not mention the subject to her ; till the time draws nearer , I do not wish to be giving any body trouble ."
Yes , indeed , there is every thing in the world that can make her happy in it .
She could only give him a look ; but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses , and then left the sofa , removing to a seat by her sister , and giving her all her attention .
It did , however .-- Her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so sudden a journey , and his fears that Mr . Elton might never get safely to the end of it , and saw nothing extraordinary in his language .
" She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there .
Will you chuse a wife for me ?-- I am sure I should like any body fixed on by you .
He has no occasion to marry , either to fill up his time or his heart ."
He seemed not merely happy with her , but proud .
The Woodhouses were first in consequence there .
" You know what you are about ."
I have not an idea -- I cannot guess it in the least .
Elton is a very good sort of man , and a very respectable vicar of Highbury , but not at all likely to make an imprudent match .
She was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from herself ."
When he was here before , we made the best of it ; but there was a good deal of wet , damp , cheerless weather ; there always is in February , you know , and we could not do half that we intended .
Let them be sent to Donwell .
As a daughter , she hoped she was not without a heart .
There was no bearing such an " always ;" and to break through her dreadful gratitude , Emma made the direct inquiry of --
Now do not you feel that you had ?
She dearly loved her father , but he was no companion for her .
he told me all about it ; that Jane Fairfax and Mr . Frank Churchill are to be married , and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while .
Both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again ; and after a few minutes silence , he said ,
She was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other .
" _His_ sufferings ," replied Emma dryly , " do not appear to have done him much harm .
" Indeed I will .
We copied it from the Elegant Extracts .
He had not left her long , by no means long enough for her to have the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else , when a letter was brought her from Randalls -- a very thick letter ;-- she guessed what it must contain , and deprecated the necessity of reading it .-- She was now in perfect charity with Frank Churchill ; she wanted no explanations , she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself -- and as for understanding any thing he wrote , she was sure she was incapable of it .-- It must be waded through , however .
He was so much displeased , that it was longer than usual before he came to Hartfield again ; and when they did meet , his grave looks shewed that she was not forgiven .
So Emma thought , at least .
Emma even jumped with surprize ;-- and , horror - struck , exclaimed ,
And how tired you must be after your journey !
Emma could not resist .
I hope you will be pleased with my son ; but you must not expect a prodigy .
I remember her telling me at the ball , that I owed Mrs . Elton gratitude for her attentions to Miss Fairfax .-- I hope this history of my conduct towards her will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss .
What do you imagine his age to be ?"
_Courtship_ -- a very good hint .
His father would not own himself uneasy , and laughed at her fears ; but she could not be cured of wishing that he would part with his black mare .
Well , I wish them happy with all my heart .
" You seem determined to think ill of him ."
I had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name , which I was not at all pleased with .
Jane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury , and was restored to the comforts of her beloved home with the Campbells .-- The Mr . Churchills were also in town ; and they were only waiting for November .
" I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr . Elton .
You do not know it I dare say , but two or three years ago I had a great passion for taking likenesses , and attempted several of my friends , and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general .
