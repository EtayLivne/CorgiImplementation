What blindness , what madness , had led her on !
" My dear Harriet , I perfectly remember the substance of what I said on the occasion .
She was aware herself , that , parting under any other circumstances , they certainly should have corresponded more , and that her intelligence would not have rested , as it now almost wholly did , on Isabella ' s letters .
" Oh !
She could never quit him ."
Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody .
In that case , nothing could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on .
" How you can bear such recollections , is astonishing to me !-- They _will_ sometimes obtrude -- but how you can court them !"
" I cannot believe that he has not the power of coming , if he made a point of it .
" Yes , simpleton as I was !-- but I am quite ashamed of it now , and wish I could forget as easily as I can burn them .
She would be such a delightful companion for Emma ."
Miss Nash , head - teacher at Mrs . Goddard ' s , had written out at least three hundred ; and Harriet , who had taken the first hint of it from her , hoped , with Miss Woodhouse ' s help , to get a great many more .
It was a commission to touch every favourite feeling .
Had you not been surrounded by other friends , I might have been tempted to introduce a subject , to ask questions , to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct .-- I feel that I should certainly have been impertinent ."
I am almost afraid that every moment will bring him ."
Mr . Elton cared little about it , compared with his wife ; he only hoped " the young lady ' s pride would now be contented ;" and supposed " she had always meant to catch Knightley if she could ;" and , on the point of living at Hartfield , could daringly exclaim , " Rather he than I !"
But the question is not , whether it would be a bad connexion for him , but whether he wishes it ; and I think he does .
Oh no ; we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart , and were sure of meeting every day ."
Bought at Weymouth , you know -- Mr . Dixon ' s choice .
Will not the old prejudice be too strong ?"
It would be a _secret_ satisfaction ; but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any thing Jane might communicate .
" My dear Harriet , you must not refine too much upon this charade .-- You will betray your feelings improperly , if you are too conscious and too quick , and appear to affix more meaning , or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it .
A worthy employment for a young lady ' s mind !
A little while ago , he was at Weymouth .
She would have been too happy but for poor Harriet ; but every blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend , who must now be even excluded from Hartfield .
He is not a gallant man , but he is a very humane one ; and this , considering Jane Fairfax ' s ill - health , would appear a case of humanity to him ;-- and for an act of unostentatious kindness , there is nobody whom I would fix on more than on Mr . Knightley .
Emma would be " very happy to wait on Mrs . Bates , & c .," and they did at last move out of the shop , with no farther delay from Miss Bates than ,
I long to make apologies , excuses , to urge something for myself .
Poor man !-- it was at first a considerable shock to him , and he tried earnestly to dissuade her from it .
" No ," cried Mr . Knightley , " that need not be the consequence .
So far from having long understood you , I have been in a most complete error with respect to your views , till this moment .
" How sorry I am !
In two minutes , however , he relented in his own favour ; and muttering something about spruce - beer , walked off .
Her own father ' s perfect exemption from any thought of the kind , the entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion , was a most comfortable circumstance .
When the Westons arrived , the kindest looks of love , the strongest of admiration were for her , from both husband and wife ; the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object , and at dinner she found him seated by her -- and , as she firmly believed , not without some dexterity on his side .
Knightley .'
He cannot want money -- he cannot want leisure .
I would much rather have been merry than wise ."
" I have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man .
He had not left her long , by no means long enough for her to have the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else , when a letter was brought her from Randalls -- a very thick letter ;-- she guessed what it must contain , and deprecated the necessity of reading it .-- She was now in perfect charity with Frank Churchill ; she wanted no explanations , she wanted only to have her thoughts to herself -- and as for understanding any thing he wrote , she was sure she was incapable of it .-- It must be waded through , however .
She did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the inferiority of her own playing and singing .
Mr . Weston was a great favourite , and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserve , as to his wife ; not any one , to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and understood , of being always interesting and always intelligible , the little affairs , arrangements , perplexities , and pleasures of her father and herself .
" That I am sure you would .
" Not at all ," cried he ; " I am much obliged to you for it .
It was a style of beauty , of which elegance was the reigning character , and as such , she must , in honour , by all her principles , admire it :-- elegance , which , whether of person or of mind , she saw so little in Highbury .
" If he would be so good as to read to them , it would be a kindness indeed !
dear , Miss Woodhouse -- well , at last , I fancy , he looked round and saw me ; for instead of going on with her buyings , they began whispering to one another .
And the same may be said of Mrs . Jeffereys -- Clara Partridge , that was -- and of the two Milmans , now Mrs . Bird and Mrs . James Cooper ; and of more than I can enumerate .
" Is she unwell ?"
Harriet listened submissively , and said " it was very true -- it was just as Miss Woodhouse described -- it was not worth while to think about them -- and she would not think about them any longer " but no change of subject could avail , and the next half - hour saw her as anxious and restless about the Eltons as before .
Not one of them had the power of removal , or of effecting any material change of society .
Mr . Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way .
But we never did .
He has encouragement enough to proceed , without our sighing out our souls over this charade ."
It soon appeared that London was not the place for her .
" I have no doubt of it ."
Mr . Dixon ' s preference of her music to her friend ' s , I can answer for being very decided ."
a man does not imagine any such thing .
It was not likely , however , that any body should have equalled her in the date of the plan , as it had entered her brain during the very first evening of Harriet ' s coming to Hartfield .
" Yes --( rather hesitatingly )-- I believe I do ."
Somebody else believed _Mrs_ .
She believed she had been foolish , but it had alarmed her , and she had been within half a minute of sending for Mr . Perry .
yes , my dear , I dare say you might , because you know , the door was open , and the window was open , and Mr . Knightley spoke loud .
After this , he made some progress without any pause .
Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably never fell in Mrs . Elton ' s way before -- and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action , if not in consciousness ."
Emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault .
Have you any thing to send or say , besides the ` love ,' which nobody carries ?"
After tea , Mr . and Mrs . Weston , and Mr . Elton sat down with Mr . Woodhouse to cards .
I think Mr . John Knightley very far from looking well ."
They all united ; and , on reaching Hartfield gates , Emma , who knew it was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father , pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him .
Harriet certainly was not clever , but she had a sweet , docile , grateful disposition , was totally free from conceit , and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to .
" There is one thing , Emma , which a man can always do , if he chuses , and that is , his duty ; not by manoeuvring and finessing , but by vigour and resolution .
Who had been at pains to give Harriet notions of self - consequence but herself ?-- Who but herself had taught her , that she was to elevate herself if possible , and that her claims were great to a high worldly establishment ?-- If Harriet , from being humble , were grown vain , it was her doing too .
had it , by any blessed felicity , occurred to her , to institute the comparison .-- She saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider Mr . Knightley as infinitely the superior , or when his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear .
The Woodhouses were first in consequence there .
What an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream !
He will find an _addition_ to the society of Highbury when he comes again ; that is , if I may presume to call myself an addition .
I perfectly remember it .-- Stop ; Mr . Knightley was standing just here , was not he ?
Enscombe is in Yorkshire ?"
" Poor creatures !
If you wish me to talk to Mrs . Hodges , or to inspect anything --"
Mrs . Weston , capital in her country - dances , was seated , and beginning an irresistible waltz ; and Frank Churchill , coming up with most becoming gallantry to Emma , had secured her hand , and led her up to the top .
She recovered her voice .
" Why , pretty well , my dear , upon the whole .
Compare Mr . Martin with either of _them_ .
Mr . Weston , do not mistake me .
cried the good - hearted Mrs . John Knightley .
This had happened the year before .
" So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax ?"
" I have escaped ; and that I should escape , may be a matter of grateful wonder to you and myself .
Emma will be happy to entertain you .
I thought him very plain at first , but I do not think him so plain now .
yes , I observed it , I assure you .
As for Mr . Elton , his manners did not appear -- but no , she would not permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners .
I give you credit for it .
Emma guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney , and too stupid to rise .
Ah !
Dear Harriet !-- I would not change you for the clearest - headed , longest - sighted , best - judging female breathing .
He had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to Highbury , as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal ; and the greater part of her new acquaintance , disposed to commend , or not in the habit of judging , following the lead of Miss Bates ' s good - will , or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed herself , were very well satisfied ; so that Mrs . Elton ' s praise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do , unimpeded by Miss Woodhouse , who readily continued her first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being " very pleasant and very elegantly dressed ."
This is precisely what I wanted .
