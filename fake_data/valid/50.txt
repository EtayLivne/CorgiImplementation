" I can never think of it ," she cried , " without extreme shame ."
I have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours , ( turning to Emma ,) a lady residing in or near Highbury ; a family of the name of Fairfax .
However , she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago ; which is saying a great deal at my mother ' s time of life -- and it really is full two years , you know , since she was here .
" What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be !
One might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right ; but I am sure there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to Highbury instead of going with the Campbells to Ireland .
He began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick - chamber again , for the present -- to entreat her to _promise_ _him_ not to venture into such hazard till he had seen Mr . Perry and learnt his opinion ; and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course , there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her .
But here there was nothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future .
" I was with Mr . Cole on business an hour and a half ago .
If I could but see her again !-- But I must not propose it yet .
As Harriet described it , there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour .
" Poor Miss Taylor !-- I wish she were here again .
Any nonsense will serve .
" Great has been the pleasure , I am sure .
she was not so easily to be talked out of it .
I understand it was a very handsome letter , indeed .
The morning of the interesting day arrived , and Mrs . Weston ' s faithful pupil did not forget either at ten , or eleven , or twelve o ' clock , that she was to think of her at four .
Then , he said , he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day ."
-- And to this day , I do believe , she knows not whether it was his present or his daughter ' s ."
His admiration was certainly very warm ; yet she thought , but for Mrs . Weston , it would not have struck her .
" There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart ," said she afterwards to herself .
Well , Frank , your dream certainly shews that Highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent .
I can imagine , that before she had seen any body superior , she might tolerate him .
" Nothing can be actually settled yet , perhaps ," replied Emma , smiling --" but , excuse me , it must be thought of ."
It will not do to _invite_ five couple .
Mr . Elton is going to be married ."
Dinner was on table .-- Mrs .
" No , no , not at all -- only a little agitated .
But Mrs . Dixon must be very much disappointed .
It was all general approbation and smoothness ; nothing delineated or distinguished .
It was her own universal good - will and contented temper which worked such wonders .
In short , she sat , during the first visit , looking at Jane Fairfax with twofold complacency ; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering justice , and was determining that she would dislike her no longer .
Do not imagine me in danger of forgetting it ."
She supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his clemency ; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in his opinion .
What ever she might feel of brighter hope , she betrayed nothing .
If he would act in this sort of manner , on principle , consistently , regularly , their little minds would bend to his ."
He had wanted very much to go abroad -- had been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel -- but she would not hear of it .
you answer as discreetly as she could do herself .
it is no difficulty to see who you take after !
Mr . Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury , and a lively curiosity to see him prevailed , though the compliment was so little returned that he had never been there in his life .
I always regret excessively on dear Emma ' s account that she cannot be more at Highbury ; but now their daughter is married , I suppose Colonel and Mrs . Campbell will not be able to part with her at all .
" I think she must be here soon ," said he .
How cheerful , how animated , how suspicious , how busy their imaginations all are !"
Will you ?
A little while ago , he was at Weymouth .
I never hear better sense from any one than Robert Martin .
This , on his side , might merely proceed from her not being thought of ; but Emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy , and a suspicion , from some appearances , that their friendship were declining .
Nobody can be more devoted to home than I am .
CHAPTER I
" Oh !
Nature gave you understanding :-- Miss Taylor gave you principles .
A few minutes made Emma acquainted with the whole .
Mrs . Weston looked , and looked in vain .
Were she a woman of fortune , I would leave every harmless absurdity to take its chance , I would not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner .
As to men and women , our opinions are sometimes very different ; but with regard to these children , I observe we never disagree ."
Kitty , a fair but frozen maid , Kindled a flame I yet deplore , The hood - wink ' d boy I called to aid , Though of his near approach afraid , So fatal to my suit before .
Much better employed talking to the young ladies .
She knows now what gentlemen are ; and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance with Harriet ."
We must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the bargain .
No -- till Cole alluded to my supposed attachment , it had never entered my head .
yes , gloves and every thing .
" Upon my honour ," said he very seriously , " it does not .
The rest of the gentlemen being now in the room , Emma found herself obliged to turn from him for a few minutes , and listen to Mr . Cole .
She went on herself , to give that portion of time to an old servant who was married , and settled in Donwell .
That ' s a consideration indeed .-- But John , as to what I was telling you of my idea of moving the path to Langham , of turning it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows , I cannot conceive any difficulty .
In spite of her vexation , she could not help feeling it almost ridiculous , that she should have the very same distressing and delicate office to perform by Harriet , which Mrs . Weston had just gone through by herself .
A very proper compliment !-- and then follows the application , which I think , my dear Harriet , you cannot find much difficulty in comprehending .
" You , who have been the best friend I ever had in my life -- Want gratitude to you !-- Nobody is equal to you !-- I care for nobody as I do for you !-- Oh !
She listened , and found it well worth listening to .
He saw a short word prepared for Emma , and given to her with a look sly and demure .
said Jane , shaking her head ; " dear Mrs . Elton , who can have thought of it as I have done ?"
By only raising my voice , and saying any thing two or three times over , she is sure to hear ; but then she is used to my voice .
" I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet , to be tempted ; Mr . Elton , you know , ( recollecting herself ,) is out of the question : and I do _not_ wish to see any such person .
She must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing , but if he were criticising her behaviour , she did not feel afraid .
No sooner was she out of sight , than Emma exclaimed ,
" Well ," said Emma , " there is no disputing about taste .-- At least you admire her except her complexion ."
no , my love ; but you will soon be tired .
Emma was out of hearing .
These were her reasons -- she had no better .
You will all be going soon I suppose ; the whole party breaking up .
She would not stir a step , nor drop a hint .
" Not at all ."
Mr . Knightley loves to find fault with me , you know -- in a joke -- it is all a joke .
poor Jane is ill !'
Emma could not help laughing as she answered , " Upon my word , I believe you know her quite as well as I do .-- But , Mr . Knightley , are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright _accepted_ him .
If I could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired -- but is Mrs . Stokes to be trusted ?
And I have no doubt that he _will_ thrive , and be a very rich man in time -- and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb _us_ ."
But you will do every thing right .
I am amused by one part of John ' s letter -- did you notice it ?-- where he says , that my information did not take him wholly by surprize , that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the kind ."
The very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten !-- My dear Mr . E ., he must have left a message for you , I am sure he must .-- Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric ;-- and his servants forgot it .
They are very important -- and sorry I am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them .
The other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax ; and there she had no doubt .
There will be a great many people talking at once .
Her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits , inconsistency of action , and inequality of powers ; and it mortified her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling , or esteemed so little worthy as a friend : but she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good , and of being able to say to herself , that could Mr . Knightley have been privy to all her attempts of assisting Jane Fairfax , could he even have seen into her heart , he would not , on this occasion , have found any thing to reprove .
" So many clever riddles as there used to be when he was young -- he wondered he could not remember them !
Not a creature knowing it but themselves -- neither the Campbells , nor her family , nor his .-- It is so wonderful , that though perfectly convinced of the fact , it is yet almost incredible to myself .
" It will be natural for me ," he added shortly afterwards , " to speak my opinion aloud as I read .
" You think so , do you ?-- I wanted the opinion of some one who could really judge .
Knightley .--" Emma , that I fear is a word -- No , I have no wish -- Stay , yes , why should I hesitate ?-- I have gone too far already for concealment .-- Emma , I accept your offer -- Extraordinary as it may seem , I accept it , and refer myself to you as a friend .-- Tell me , then , have I no chance of ever succeeding ?"
She is very timid and silent .
No one , I believe , can blame her more than she is disposed to blame herself .
