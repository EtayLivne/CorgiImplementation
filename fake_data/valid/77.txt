You had , somehow or other , broken bounds yesterday , and run away from your own management ; but to - day you are got back again -- and as I cannot be always with you , it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine ."
" Between Mr . Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax ?
She stopped to breathe .
What is all this ?"
Mr . Weston meanwhile , perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was exciting , happy and cheerful as usual , and with all the right of being principal talker , which a day spent anywhere from home confers , was making himself agreeable among the rest ; and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner , convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants had been forgotten , and spread abroad what public news he had heard , was proceeding to a family communication , which , though principally addressed to Mrs . Weston , he had not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in the room .
I always make a point of reading Jane ' s letters through to myself first , before I read them aloud to my mother , you know , for fear of there being any thing in them to distress her .
Such expressions , assisted as they were by every thing that look and manner could do , made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet so well , nor valued her affection so highly before .
-- Highbury , with Mrs . Weston , stood for Hartfield ; and she trusted to its bearing the same construction with him .
She had heard and seen it all ; and felt some curiosity to know whether the wet walk of this morning had produced any .
Highbury , that airy , cheerful , happy - looking Highbury , would be his constant attraction ."
Emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love .
Mr . Elton looked all alarm on the occasion , as he exclaimed ,
How long had Mr . Knightley been so dear to her , as every feeling declared him now to be ?
And as for Harriet , I will venture to say that _she_ cannot gain by the acquaintance .
" You are prepared for the worst , I see -- and very bad it is .
" Well , sir ," cried Mr . Weston , " as I took Miss Taylor away , it is incumbent on me to supply her place , if I can ; and I will step to Mrs . Goddard in a moment , if you wish it ."
" Dear me !
Now do not you feel that you had ?
Mr . Elton must now be left to himself .
She merely said , in the course of some trivial chat , " Well , Harriet , whenever you marry I would advise you to do so and so "-- and thought no more of it , till after a minute ' s silence she heard Harriet say in a very serious tone , " I shall never marry ."
Her father ' s business was to announce James ' s being gone out to put the horses to , preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls ; and she had , therefore , an immediate excuse for disappearing .
In spite of all her faults , she knew she was dear to him ; might she not say , very dear ?-- When the suggestions of hope , however , which must follow here , presented themselves , she could not presume to indulge them .
But it should be so no more .
" Oh !
After some attempts , therefore , to be permitted to begin again , they were obliged to thank Mrs . Weston , look sorrowful , and have done .
I am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you -- and to give you joy in person ."
They have no mercy on her ."
You find me trying to be useful ; tell me if you think I shall succeed ."
Her regard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him , and her regrets kept alive , and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss Hawkins ' s happiness , and continual observation of , how much he seemed attached !-- his air as he walked by the house -- the very sitting of his hat , being all in proof of how much he was in love !
He asked my opinion as to what he was now to do .
The conviction seemed real ; he looked as if he felt it .
And yet it was far , very far , from impossible .-- Was it a new circumstance for a man of first - rate abilities to be captivated by very inferior powers ?
" How is your niece , Miss Bates ?-- I want to inquire after you all , but particularly your niece .
Colonel Campbell , you know , is quite our angel .
You would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way , if you were married ."
Its tendency would be to raise and refine her mind -- and it must be saving her from the danger of degradation .
he cried , " I wish your father might be half as easily convinced as John will be , of our having every right that equal worth can give , to be happy together .
She did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife , though growing very like her ;-- _she_ spoke some of her feelings , by observing audibly to her partner ,
She had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness ; and the person , whom she had been so many months neglecting , was now the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy .
" Oh !
She is his principal correspondent , I assure you .
Perry says that colds have been very general , but not so heavy as he has very often known them in November .
what would Frank Churchill say to her , if he were here ?
.
Emma ' s courage returned , and she walked on .
The great Mrs . Churchill was no more .
With the exception of this little blot , Emma found that his visit hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him .
" We were too magnificent ," said he .
Mr . Perry could not quite understand him , but he was very sure there must be a _lady_ in the case , and he told him so ; and Mr . Elton only looked very conscious and smiling , and rode off in great spirits .
And I am not only , not going to be married , at present , but have very little intention of ever marrying at all ."
Let me hear from you without delay ; I am impatient for a thousand particulars .
" Well done , Mrs .
" Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced .
and I always thought you meant it ."
Have patience with me , I shall soon have done .-- She closed with this offer , resolving to break with me entirely , and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again .-- _She_ _felt_ _the_ _engagement_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _source_ _of_ _repentance_ _and_ _misery_ _to_ _each_ : _she_ _dissolved_ _it_ .-- This letter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt ' s death .
Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs . Elton , though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her .
Nothing could be pleasanter .
Two such she did not want .
replied he .
" Now he has got my letter ," said she softly .
It is the very last thing I would stand the brunt of just now .
You have many parties of that kind here , I suppose , Miss Woodhouse , every summer ?"
Like him , she had tried the scheme and rejected it ; but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her .
" Low , I am afraid , sir , very low ," answered his son ;--" but we shall be indulgent -- especially to any one who leads the way ."
" For when a lady ' s in the case , " You know all other things give place ."
" I can answer for every thing of that nature , sir , because it will be under Mrs . Weston ' s care .
Tea passed pleasantly , and nobody seemed in a hurry to move .
And now , poor girl !
Conceive what the events of a week have done in that family !
cried Emma , " I know there is not a better creature in the world : but you must allow , that what is good and what is ridiculous are most unfortunately blended in her ."
The party was to be our brother and sister , Henry , John -- and Miss Smith .
The manner , perhaps , may have as little to recommend them .
I heard a good deal of Colonel Campbell ' s taste at Weymouth ; and the softness of the upper notes I am sure is exactly what he and _all_ _that_ _party_ would particularly prize .
She played and sang ;-- and drew in almost every style ; but steadiness had always been wanting ; and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad to command , and ought not to have failed of .
" Oh !
to which his prompt reply was , " Most readily , Mrs . Weston , if you will dance with me ."
After these came a second set ; among the most come - at - able of whom were Mrs . and Miss Bates , and Mrs . Goddard , three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield , and who were fetched and carried home so often , that Mr . Woodhouse thought it no hardship for either James or the horses .
" This would soon have led to something better , of course ," was her consoling reflection ; " any thing interests between those who love ; and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart .
Every thing tender and charming was to mark their parting ; but still they were to part .
We are growing a little too nice .
" My dear Miss Woodhouse , a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act .
" Did he appear a sensible young man ; a young man of information ?"
" No , no ; your room is full enough .
Emma could say no more .
He had gone beyond the sweep -- some way along the Highbury road -- the snow was nowhere above half an inch deep -- in many places hardly enough to whiten the ground ; a very few flakes were falling at present , but the clouds were parting , and there was every appearance of its being soon over .
What is the foolish girl about ?"
Emma felt that she could not do too much for her , that Harriet had a right to all her ingenuity and all her patience ; but it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing any effect , for ever agreed to , without being able to make their opinions the same .
And , in short , from knowing his usual ways , I am very much inclined to think that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all .
convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about Hartfield .
Tell me , I charge you tell me this moment what it is ."
For some weeks past she had been spending more than half her time there , and gradually getting to have a bed - room appropriated to herself ; and Emma judged it best in every respect , safest and kindest , to keep her with them as much as possible just at present .
" Have not you mistaken the day ?"
It soon appeared that London was not the place for her .
Emma could not think it too soon ; for with all his good and agreeable qualities , there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to laugh .
I always stand up for women -- and I assure you , if you knew how Selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn , you would not wonder at Mrs . Churchill ' s making incredible exertions to avoid it .
I am sure you did not much expect to like us .
Quite thick shoes .
They are known to no human being , I guess , but herself .
Upon such occasions poor Mr . Woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare .
" I dare say they are , sir .
