For Mrs . Weston there was nothing to be done ; for Harriet every thing .
I doubt whether he will return the compliment , and discover her to be a lady .
Mrs . Weston , with her baby on her knee , indulging in such reflections as these , was one of the happiest women in the world .
He will find an _addition_ to the society of Highbury when he comes again ; that is , if I may presume to call myself an addition .
She is as low as possible .
Mr . Woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused .
Most comfortable carriage .-- Oh !
This was her history ; and particularly interesting it was to Mr . Woodhouse , who commended her very much for thinking of sending for Perry , and only regretted that she had not done it .
It was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was _not_ a fine lady ; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of it ;-- and she was considering in what way she had best retract , when Mr . Weston went on .
His professions and his proposals did him no service .
Ladies can never look ill . And , seriously , Miss Fairfax is naturally so pale , as almost always to give the appearance of ill health .-- A most deplorable want of complexion ."
She must not make it a more decided subject of misery to him , by a melancholy tone herself .
" Mr . Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse flirted together excessively ."
I know it has .
_She_ could not .
Much , much beyond impropriety !-- It has sunk him , I cannot say how it has sunk him in my opinion .
At the same time , I will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint , because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing before I am aware .
united , what reverse we have !
You must have heard every thing to be sure .
They called for him in their way ; were all extremely amused ; and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day -- which he did -- and in the course of that visit ( as I understand ) he found an opportunity of speaking to Harriet ; and certainly did not speak in vain .-- She made him , by her acceptance , as happy even as he is deserving .
As I am happily quite an altered creature in _one_ _respect_ , it is very fit that you should have the satisfaction of knowing it .
_Now_ , he said , he was beginning to have no longer the same wish .
We had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all .
The plan was that she should be brought up for educating others ; the very few hundred pounds which she inherited from her father making independence impossible .
He had expressed himself as to coming , with more than common certainty .
" If it were admissible to contradict a lady ," said the gallant Mr . Elton --
I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else .
Her own attachment had really subsided into a mere nothing ; it was not worth thinking of ;-- but if he , who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the two , were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he had taken away , it would be very distressing .
" I thank you ; but I assure you you are quite mistaken .
She heard him sigh .
An injunction of secresy had been among Mr . Weston ' s parting words .
Even if this family , the Braithwaites , are put off , I am still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us .
He may have as strong a sense of what would be right , as you can have , without being so equal , under particular circumstances , to act up to it ."
Emma laughed , and replied ,
How do you do , Mr .
I could not have believed it !
Knightley !-- How she could dare to fancy herself the chosen of such a man till actually assured of it !-- But Harriet was less humble , had fewer scruples than formerly .-- Her inferiority , whether of mind or situation , seemed little felt .-- She had seemed more sensible of Mr . Elton ' s being to stoop in marrying her , than she now seemed of Mr .
Chuse your own degree of crossness .
Books of engravings , drawers of medals , cameos , corals , shells , and every other family collection within his cabinets , had been prepared for his old friend , to while away the morning ; and the kindness had perfectly answered .
She ran away to indulge the inclination , leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to Harriet ' s share .
" Who could have thought it ?
" Oh !
" Oh !
Could the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance !-- But of that , unfortunately , there could be no chance .
He would feel himself in the right ; and the declaration -- made , of course , as a man of sense would make it , in a proper manner -- would do him more good , raise him higher , fix his interest stronger with the people he depended on , than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do .
She could not speak another word .-- Her voice was lost ; and she sat down , waiting in great terror till Harriet should answer .
I thought it my duty as a friend , and older than yourself , to say thus much to you .
" Do you dare say this ?"
She did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the inferiority of her own playing and singing .
In such a party , Harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise ; but for the poor girl herself , it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment .
Mr . Knightley ' s eyes had preceded Miss Bates ' s in a glance at Jane .
the blessing of a female correspondent , when one is really interested in the absent !-- she will tell me every thing .
Of all the sources of evil surrounding the former , since her coming to Highbury , she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst .
She was sensible of all the affection it evinced .
She had not been able to speak ; and , on entering the carriage , sunk back for a moment overcome -- then reproaching herself for having taken no leave , making no acknowledgment , parting in apparent sullenness , she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference ; but it was just too late .
So much the better .
By only raising my voice , and saying any thing two or three times over , she is sure to hear ; but then she is used to my voice .
she was considerably worse from this reappearance of Mr . Elton .
The dread of being awakened from the happiest dream , was perhaps the most prominent feeling .
This does not seem much like joy , indeed , in me --( twinkling away a tear or two )-- but it will be very trying for us to part with her , after having had her so long , and she has a dreadful headache just now , writing all the morning :-- such long letters , you know , to be written to Colonel Campbell , and Mrs . Dixon .
When she became sensible of this , it struck her that she could not be very much in love ; for in spite of her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father , never to marry , a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings .
Come , he knows himself there .
CHAPTER XVI
" A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance , to be married to a respectable , intelligent gentleman - farmer !"
I like him very much .
Every body knows what is due to _you_ ."
Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably never fell in Mrs . Elton ' s way before -- and no degree of vanity can prevent her acknowledging her own comparative littleness in action , if not in consciousness ."
Harriet turned away ; but Emma could receive him with the usual smile , and her quick eye soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a push -- of having thrown a die ; and she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up .
Such was his own account at Randall ' s .
Her heart had been long growing kinder towards Jane ; and this picture of her present sufferings acted as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion , and left her nothing but pity ; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of the past , obliged her to admit that Jane might very naturally resolve on seeing Mrs . Cole or any other steady friend , when she might not bear to see herself .
As the blow was given , Emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than in listening ; and Harriet , unchecked , ran eagerly through what she had to tell .
Besides the Eltons , it must be the Westons and Mr . Knightley ; so far it was all of course -- and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little Harriet must be asked to make the eighth :-- but this invitation was not given with equal satisfaction , and on many accounts Emma was particularly pleased by Harriet ' s begging to be allowed to decline it .
I had not thought of it before , but that is the best way .
" It is certainly very well regulated ."
She had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother , but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother ' s unreasonable anger , nor from missing the luxuries of her former home .
" No ; he thought it very far from an improvement -- a very bad plan -- much worse than the other .
If he were , every thing else must give way ; but otherwise his friend Cole had been saying so much about his dining with him -- had made such a point of it , that he had promised him conditionally to come .
Somebody else believed _Mrs_ .
Should she proceed no farther ?-- should she let it pass , and seem to suspect nothing ?-- Perhaps Harriet might think her cold or angry if she did ; or perhaps if she were totally silent , it might only drive Harriet into asking her to hear too much ; and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been , such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances , she was perfectly resolved .-- She believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at once , all that she meant to say and know .
He paused .
Can the old lady ?"
" I was going to observe , sir ," said Frank Churchill , " that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any body ' s catching cold -- so much less danger at the Crown than at Randalls !
He looked with smiling penetration ; and , on receiving no answer , added , " _She_ ought not to be angry with you , I suspect , whatever he may be .-- To that surmise , you say nothing , of course ; but confess , Emma , that you did want him to marry Harriet ."
She had not been able to speak ; and , on entering the carriage , sunk back for a moment overcome -- then reproaching herself for having taken no leave , making no acknowledgment , parting in apparent sullenness , she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference ; but it was just too late .
It was quite a different sort of thing , a sentiment distinct and independent .
" Cautious , very cautious ," thought Emma ; " he advances inch by inch , and will hazard nothing till he believes himself secure ."
When the Westons arrived , the kindest looks of love , the strongest of admiration were for her , from both husband and wife ; the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object , and at dinner she found him seated by her -- and , as she firmly believed , not without some dexterity on his side .
Her affection must have overpowered her judgment ."
" Well , I cannot understand it ."
It was Garrick ' s , you know ."
She had brought evil on Harriet , on herself , and she too much feared , on Mr .
Harriet Smith ' s intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing .
Mr . Elton was to take the drawing to London , chuse the frame , and give the directions ; and Emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him , while he seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough .
" Great has been the pleasure , I am sure .
And as for Mrs . Hodges , Wright holds her very cheap indeed .-- She promised Wright a receipt , and never sent it ."
CHAPTER XIV
Jane ' s alertness in moving , proved her as ready as her aunt had preconceived .
" Yes , yes -- but I am amused that he should have seen so far into my feelings .
" Very odd !
He was very much vexed .
