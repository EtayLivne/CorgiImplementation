John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection , and Isabella always thinks as he does ; except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children .
She was extremely angry with herself .
One does not , you know , after a time .
" Perry !"
The Eltons walked together ; Mr . Knightley took charge of Miss Bates and Jane ; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill .
" My dear madam !
Mr . Martin is now awkward and abrupt ; what will he be at Mr . Weston ' s time of life ?"
You think you carry it off very well , I dare say , but with you it is a sort of bravado , an air of affected unconcern ; I always observe it whenever I meet you under those circumstances .
Go , and interfere .
It seemed too precious an offering for any degree of publicity .
She was the instigator .
" I do not know which it ought to be called ."
" Oh yes , sir ," cried she with ready sympathy , " how you must miss her !
How could you be so insolent in your wit to a woman of her character , age , and situation ?-- Emma , I had not thought it possible ."
It is only by seeing women in their own homes , among their own set , just as they always are , that you can form any just judgment .
It must have been from attachment only , that she could be led to form the engagement .
Being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling , I have been in no hurry with my congratulations ; but I hope it all went off tolerably well .
Elton ?"
He gave her to understand that Frank admired her extremely -- thought her very beautiful and very charming ; and with so much to be said for him altogether , she found she must not judge him harshly .
My mother often talks of your good - nature .
It seemed an unnecessary caution ; Jane was wanting to give her words , not to Mrs . Elton , but to Miss Woodhouse , as the latter plainly saw .
Nothing , but to grow more worthy of him , whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own .
" You are in luck .-- Your only blunder was confined to my ear , when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady ."
Jane has heard a great deal of its beauty ; from Mr . Dixon , I mean -- I do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else ; but it was very natural , you know , that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addresses -- and as Jane used to be very often walking out with them -- for Colonel and Mrs . Campbell were very particular about their daughter ' s not walking out often with only Mr . Dixon , for which I do not at all blame them ; of course she heard every thing he might be telling Miss Campbell about his own home in Ireland ; and I think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place , views that he had taken himself .
" That Mr . Elton should really be in love with me ,-- me , of all people , who did not know him , to speak to him , at Michaelmas !
The refreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary .
One natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in ," she said , " was that of making her _unreasonable_ .
He certainly might have heard Mr . Elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done , and Mr . Elton might not be of an imprudent , inconsiderate disposition as to money matters ; he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them ; but then , Mr . Knightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives .
" Mr .
" I have no hesitation in saying ," replied Mr . Elton , though hesitating a good deal while he spoke ; " I have no hesitation in saying -- at least if my friend feels at all as _I_ do -- I have not the smallest doubt that , could he see his little effusion honoured as _I_ see it , ( looking at the book again , and replacing it on the table ), he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life ."
Her ideas only varied as to the how much .
" Well ," said Emma , willing to let it pass --" you want to hear about the wedding ; and I shall be happy to tell you , for we all behaved charmingly .
And it is not merely the house -- the grounds , I assure you , as far as I could observe , are strikingly like .
I can hardly believe it .-- I thought I knew him ."
They were stopping , however , in the first place at Mrs . Bates ' s ; whose house was a little nearer Randalls than Ford ' s ; and had all but knocked , when Emma caught their eye .-- Immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her ; and the agreeableness of yesterday ' s engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting .
He did not believe it to proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove , or at least that she might not have many years of existence before her ; but he could not be prevailed on , by all his father ' s doubts , to say that her complaints were merely imaginary , or that she was as strong as ever .
" But it is never safe to sit out of doors , my dear ."
" No , not now , I thank you .
And so excellent in the Church !
Mr . and Mrs . John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield .
A very gracious invitation was returned , and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion .
He was accused of having a delightful voice , and a perfect knowledge of music ; which was properly denied ; and that he knew nothing of the matter , and had no voice at all , roundly asserted .
she cried , satisfied to have no one preferred to herself .--" You are a humourist , and may say what you like .
she found something else must be done .
Yet he would speak .
It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned .
But you know what I am .-- You hear nothing but truth from me .-- I have blamed you , and lectured you , and you have borne it as no other woman in England would have borne it .-- Bear with the truths I would tell you now , dearest Emma , as well as you have borne with them .
He had said that Jane Fairfax received attentions from Mrs . Elton which nobody else paid her .
" Yes --( rather hesitatingly )-- I believe I do ."
That Mr . and Mrs . Weston did think of it , she was very strongly persuaded ; and though not meaning to be induced by him , or by any body else , to give up a situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could change it for , she had a great curiosity to see him , a decided intention of finding him pleasant , of being liked by him to a certain degree , and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends ' imaginations .
He turned to Mrs . Weston to implore her assistance , " Would not she give him her support ?-- would not she add her persuasions to his , to induce Miss Woodhouse not to go to Mrs . Goddard ' s till it were certain that Miss Smith ' s disorder had no infection ?
The pain of his continued residence in Highbury , however , must certainly be lessened by his marriage .
Ladies can never look ill . And , seriously , Miss Fairfax is naturally so pale , as almost always to give the appearance of ill health .-- A most deplorable want of complexion ."
I am sure of your kind support and aid ."
The very day of Mr . Elton ' s going to London produced a fresh occasion for Emma ' s services towards her friend .
It seems an impossibility !-- You cannot mean to say , that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin .
I really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey .
You are not just to Harriet ' s claims .
Keep your raptures for Harriet ' s face .
He looked at her , as if wanting to read her thoughts .
May I hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball , to be given , not at Randalls , but at the Crown Inn ?"
With the greatest respect , and the warmest friendship , do I mention Miss Woodhouse ; my father perhaps will think I ought to add , with the deepest humiliation .-- A few words which dropped from him yesterday spoke his opinion , and some censure I acknowledge myself liable to .-- My behaviour to Miss Woodhouse indicated , I believe , more than it ought .-- In order to assist a concealment so essential to me , I was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately thrown .-- I cannot deny that Miss Woodhouse was my ostensible object -- but I am sure you will believe the declaration , that had I not been convinced of her indifference , I would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on .-- Amiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is , she never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached ; and that she was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me , was as much my conviction as my wish .-- She received my attentions with an easy , friendly , goodhumoured playfulness , which exactly suited me .
You had , somehow or other , broken bounds yesterday , and run away from your own management ; but to - day you are got back again -- and as I cannot be always with you , it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine ."
But we never did .
I should be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain .
I am quite ready .
my dear , it is not like Hartfield .
She will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience , and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding .
" Your command ?-- Yes ."
I said to my mother , ` Upon my word , ma ' am --.'
There can be no doubt of its being written for you and to you ."
" Come ," said she , " I will tell you something , in return for what you have told me .
What has Mr . Frank Churchill done , to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature ?"
Happy creature !
Resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father , from which she was so pointedly excluded .
go to - day , go to - day .
Oh !
It was owing to _her_ persuasion , as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm .
" Good or bad ?"
Depend upon it he had encouragement ."
You might not see one in a hundred with _gentleman_ so plainly written as in Mr . Knightley .
Cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his neighbours ."
So afraid you might have a headache !-- seeing you pass by so often , and knowing how much trouble you must have .
Adopt her , educate her ."
This is the simple truth ."
There were three others , Jane says , which they hesitated about some time .
Is Perry going to set up his carriage , Frank ?
Do not you begin to feel that now ?
That would have been too dreadful !-- What an escape !-- Dear Miss Woodhouse , I would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world ."
Emma was obliged to fancy what she liked -- but she could never believe that in the same situation _she_ should not have discovered the truth .
It seemed as if her eyes were suddenly opened , and she were enabled to see that Mr . Elton was not the superior creature she had believed him .
" No , sir ," replied his son , laughing , " I seem to have had it from nobody .-- Very odd !-- I really was persuaded of Mrs . Weston ' s having mentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe , many weeks ago , with all these particulars -- but as she declares she never heard a syllable of it before , of course it must have been a dream .
For a moment he was silent ; and then added , in a tone much more guarded and demure ,
Not that I imagine he can think I have been encouraging him hitherto .
Emma could not think it too soon ; for with all his good and agreeable qualities , there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to laugh .
He had found her agitated and low .-- Frank Churchill was a villain .-- He heard her declare that she had never loved him .
Her looks and words had nothing to restrain them .
The disguise , equivocation , mystery , so hateful to her to practise , might soon be over .
There is no use in delay .
Mr . Knightley is coming too .
