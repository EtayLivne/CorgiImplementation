said she , beginning again when they were all in the street .
" Well , Miss Woodhouse ," he almost immediately began , " your inclination for dancing has not been quite frightened away , I hope , by the terrors of my father ' s little rooms .
my dear , it is not like Hartfield .
Emma was extremely confused .
" Perhaps it is as well ," said Frank Churchill , as he attended Emma to her carriage .
I come in for a pretty good share as a second .
Will not the old prejudice be too strong ?"
" No ; not immediately here .
For a little while Emma persevered in her silence ; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that letter might be too powerful , she thought it best to say ,
Emma could not have a better companion than Harriet ."
But neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once , and Emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time .
Think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy ; and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it , and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of Mr . Knightley ' s marrying Jane Fairfax , or any body else , which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt .
[ To Mrs .
" And mine ," said Mr . Knightley warmly , " is , that if he turn out any thing like it , he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing !
The very day of Mr . Elton ' s going to London produced a fresh occasion for Emma ' s services towards her friend .
She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith ' s conversation , but she found her altogether very engaging -- not inconveniently shy , not unwilling to talk -- and yet so far from pushing , shewing so proper and becoming a deference , seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to Hartfield , and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to , that she must have good sense , and deserve encouragement .
" There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _that_ ,"-- said Mr . Knightley , feelingly ; and for a moment or two he had done .
Absolutely insufferable !
" A sore - throat !-- I hope not infectious .
Where features were indifferent , a fine complexion gave beauty to them all ; and where they were good , the effect was -- fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the effect was .
" By the bye -- I have not wished you joy .
But that would be all over now .-- Poor fellow !-- No more exploring parties to Donwell made for _her_ .
She understood it all ; and as far as her mind could disengage itself from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings , she acknowledged that Jane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her desert .
Though much might be fancy , he could not doubt , when he looked back , that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been half a year ago .
Wickedness is always wickedness , but folly is not always folly .-- It depends upon the character of those who handle it .
But Mr . Knightley is so very fine a man !"
" I not aware !"
I know he had horses to - day -- for we arrived together ; and I laughed at him about it , but he said not a word that could betray ."
This is precisely what I wanted .
But -- that he should talk of encouragement , should consider her as aware of his views , accepting his attentions , meaning ( in short ), to marry him !-- should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind !-- look down upon her friend , so well understanding the gradations of rank below him , and be so blind to what rose above , as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her !-- It was most provoking .
It was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being employed on such an errand ."
Did you ever hear of that ?-- A water party ; and by some accident she was falling overboard .
I knew it was -- but had not resolution enough to part with them ."
It was dreadfully mortifying ; but Mr . Elton was proving himself , in many respects , the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him ; proud , assuming , conceited ; very full of his own claims , and little concerned about the feelings of others .
I had not the least idea !-- Jane took Mrs . Elton aside , and told her at once , that upon thinking over the advantages of Mrs . Smallridge ' s situation , she had come to the resolution of accepting it .-- I did not know a word of it till it was all settled ."
Do not let mine continue longer .
" Much , indeed !"
He is going to Kingston .
" Yes , you were very cross ; and I do not know what about , except that you were too late for the best strawberries .
Besides , if she does play so very well , you know , it is no more than she is obliged to do , because she will have to teach .
in places you see it is dreadfully dirty ; and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing I could have imagined ."
" My father would say ` yes ,' Mr . Knightley ` no ;' and Miss Bates and I that he is just the happy medium .
You like Mr . Elton , papa ,-- I must look about for a wife for him .
I see it in her cheek , her smile , her vain attempt to frown .
In one moment such a change !
You want your neighbours ' opinions .
united , what reverse we have !
It may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to be understood .
Mr . Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make ; which was exactly the case ; for though very much gratified by the kind care of such a fair lady , and not liking to resist any advice of her ' s , he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit ;-- but Emma , too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him impartially , or see him with clear vision , was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its being " very cold , certainly very cold ," and walked on , rejoicing in having extricated him from Randalls , and secured him the power of sending to inquire after Harriet every hour of the evening .
" Oh , Mrs . Churchill ; every body knows Mrs . Churchill ," replied Isabella : " and I am sure I never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion .
" Harriet !"
It would be a great comfort to Mr . Weston , as he grew older -- and even Mr . Weston might be growing older ten years hence -- to have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense , the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home ; and Mrs . Weston -- no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her ; and it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach , should not have their powers in exercise again .
I would not say so to every body , Mrs . Elton , but I have not much faith in Mrs . Churchill ' s illness ."
But Harriet was in a tremor , and could not touch it ; and Emma , never loth to be first , was obliged to examine it herself .
Her first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who were the parents , but Harriet could not tell .
She had an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man , for she hardly knew what indisposition was ; and if he did not invent illnesses for her , she could make no figure in a message .
" You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax , sir , are you ?"
no -- I never conceived you could become indifferent .
Henry is the eldest , he was named after me , not after his father .
It seemed at first an accidental division , but it never materially varied .
How long had Mr . Knightley been so dear to her , as every feeling declared him now to be ?
My mother ' s are really very good indeed .
It did assist ; for though he began with grave looks and short questions , he was soon led on to talk of them all in the usual way , and to take the child out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity .
The weather was most favourable for her ; though Christmas Day , she could not go to church .
" Very serious !
" I mentioned no _names_ , you will observe .-- Oh !
Proportions , fore - shortening .-- Oh no !
" I perfectly agree with you , sir ,"-- was then his remark .
No additional agitation should be thrown at this period among those she loved -- and the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the appointed time .-- A fortnight , at least , of leisure and peace of mind , to crown every warmer , but more agitating , delight , should be hers .
Mr . Knightley , in fact , was one of the few people who could see faults in Emma Woodhouse , and the only one who ever told her of them : and though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself , she knew it would be so much less so to her father , that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body .
Mrs . Weston remained with Mr . Woodhouse .
He had been at the pains of consulting Mr . Perry , the apothecary , on the subject .
We shall have no occasion to open the windows at all -- not once the whole evening ; and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows , letting in cold air upon heated bodies , which ( as you well know , sir ) does the mischief ."
" Upon my word ," she cried , " the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking .
She was quick in feeling the little injuries to Isabella , which Isabella never felt herself .
Emma divined what every body present must be thinking .
" I am most happy to hear it -- but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be so very accomplished and superior !-- and exactly Emma ' s age ."
" It is very pretty ," said Mr . Woodhouse .
Dear , Miss Woodhouse , I was absolutely miserable !
Ford .-- " Yes -- no -- yes , to Mrs . Goddard ' s .
My perpetual influence could not begin earlier , or you would not have been so much out of humour before ."
It was done however .
" She is a riddle , quite a riddle !"
I thought it my duty as a friend , and older than yourself , to say thus much to you .
Let my father ' s servant go with you .-- Let me order the carriage .
Emma made no answer , and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned , but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone .
And ( raising his voice still more ) I do not see why Miss Fairfax should not be mentioned too .
You are so much used to live alone , that you do not know the value of a companion ; and , perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her own sex , after being used to it all her life .
The acquaintance she had already formed were unworthy of her .
I hope we shall have her here next week .
" As soon as my aunt gets well , I shall go abroad ," said he .
yes -- she will have her own room , of course ; the room she always has ;-- and there is the nursery for the children ,-- just as usual , you know .
my dear , human flesh !
Mrs . Weston undertakes to direct the whole ."
" If I know myself , Harriet , mine is an active , busy mind , with a great many independent resources ; and I do not perceive why I should be more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one - and - twenty .
All was safe and prosperous ; and as the removal of one solicitude generally makes way for another , Emma , being now certain of her ball , began to adopt as the next vexation Mr . Knightley ' s provoking indifference about it .
I do suspect that he is not really necessary to my happiness .
To take a dislike to a young man , only because he appeared to be of a different disposition from himself , was unworthy the real liberality of mind which she was always used to acknowledge in him ; for with all the high opinion of himself , which she had often laid to his charge , she had never before for a moment supposed it could make him unjust to the merit of another .
It inspired little more than an animating curiosity .
Dinner was on table .-- Mrs .
