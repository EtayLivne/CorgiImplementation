I long to make apologies , excuses , to urge something for myself .
What years of felicity that man , in all human calculation , has before him !-- Assured of the love of such a woman -- the disinterested love , for Jane Fairfax ' s character vouches for her disinterestedness ; every thing in his favour ,-- equality of situation -- I mean , as far as regards society , and all the habits and manners that are important ; equality in every point but one -- and that one , since the purity of her heart is not to be doubted , such as must increase his felicity , for it will be his to bestow the only advantages she wants .-- A man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from ; and he who can do it , where there is no doubt of _her_ regard , must , I think , be the happiest of mortals .-- Frank Churchill is , indeed , the favourite of fortune .
said he , offering his hand .
" Oh !
She was happy , she knew she was happy , and knew she ought to be happy .
There were wishes at Randalls respecting Emma ' s destiny , but it was not desirable to have them suspected ; and the quiet transition which Mr . Knightley soon afterwards made to " What does Weston think of the weather ; shall we have rain ?"
Has Perry seen her ?
said he with a tender sigh , as he received it .
" And I am quite serious too , I assure you ," replied Mrs . Elton gaily , " in resolving to be always on the watch , and employing my friends to watch also , that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us ."
If she has it now , you have given it .
He is a most charming young man .
He could now , without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise , without a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest , give way to all his natural kind - hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after Mr . Frank Churchill ' s accommodation on his journey , through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road , and express very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold -- which , however , he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till after another night .
However , I think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again .
" Yes : but a young lady -- a bride -- I ought to have paid my respects to her if possible .
.
He was no dancer in general .
" I do not know what I could imagine , but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers .
" How often we shall be going to see them , and they coming to see us !-- We shall be always meeting !
Mr . Elton ' s superiority had very ample acknowledgment .
From that moment , Emma could have taken her oath that Mr . Knightley had had no concern in giving the instrument .
" No , my dear ," said her father instantly ; " _that_ I am sure you are not .
" True , sir ; and Emma , because she had Miss Fairfax ."
I forget where we had been walking to -- very likely to Randalls ; yes , I think it was to Randalls .
Mr . Weston , with triumph of a different sort , was confessing that he had known it to be snowing some time , but had not said a word , lest it should make Mr . Woodhouse uncomfortable , and be an excuse for his hurrying away .
" There is nothing to be compared to it .
They all seemed to remember the day , the hour , the party , the occasion -- to feel the same consciousness , the same regrets -- to be ready to return to the same good understanding ; and they were just growing again like themselves , ( Harriet , as Emma must suspect , as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy ,) when the carriage reappeared , and all was over .
She saw it all ; and entering into her feelings , promoted her quitting the house immediately , and watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend .
Well , Frank , your dream certainly shews that Highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent .
" Such a fortnight as it has been !"
It would be the greatest pleasure to them , if you could allow me to attend you there .
For some weeks past she had been spending more than half her time there , and gradually getting to have a bed - room appropriated to herself ; and Emma judged it best in every respect , safest and kindest , to keep her with them as much as possible just at present .
Knightley ?"
But I was really quite shocked the other day -- for Mr . Knightley called one morning , and Jane was eating these apples , and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them , and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock .
CHAPTER XV
He can sit down and write a fine flourishing letter , full of professions and falsehoods , and persuade himself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his father ' s having any right to complain .
He has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all !-- You must let me read it to him ."
" Here have I ," said she , " actually talked poor Harriet into being very much attached to this man .
Mr . Knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment , and that not another syllable of communication could rest with him .
Any thing else I should be most happy to do , at your command -- but my dancing days are over ."
We do not often look upon fine young men , well - bred and agreeable .
" But if I do , I shall be crosser still .
Oh !
I assure you I began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous .
The first error and the worst lay at her door .
To her it was real enjoyment to be with the Westons .
" We were too magnificent ," said he .
Mrs . Elton ' s invitations I should have imagined any thing but inviting ."
To provide for her otherwise was out of Colonel Campbell ' s power ; for though his income , by pay and appointments , was handsome , his fortune was moderate and must be all his daughter ' s ; but , by giving her an education , he hoped to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter .
They were combined only of anger against herself , mortification , and deep concern .
She could not but hear ; she could not avoid answering ,
With this inspiriting notion , her questions increased in number and meaning ; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr . Martin , and there was evidently no dislike to it .
Ah !
Could I mention any thing more fit to be done , than to go to Mrs . Goddard ?
" When you have seen more of this country , I am afraid you will think you have overrated Hartfield .
Poor dear Jane was talking of it just now .-- ` You must go ,' said she .
I never hear better sense from any one than Robert Martin .
I cannot at all consent to Mr . Knightley ' s marrying ; and I am sure it is not at all likely .
She was not obliged to hear .
I have been but half a friend to her ; and if she were _not_ to feel this disappointment so very much , I am sure I have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable for her ;-- William Coxe -- Oh !
It is such a happiness when good people get together -- and they always do .
But ( with a reproachful smile at Emma ) she receives attentions from Mrs . Elton , which nobody else pays her ."
But with all the hopes of cheerfulness , and all the present comfort of delay , there was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with Harriet , as made it impossible for Emma to be ever perfectly at ease .
" Come ," said she , " I will tell you something , in return for what you have told me .
He went to Highbury the next morning , and satisfied himself on that point .
" And then , he saved her life .
Could not have imagined it .-- So well lighted up !-- Jane , Jane , look !-- did you ever see any thing ?
Mrs . Bates and Mrs . Elton were together .
And poor John ' s son came to talk to Mr . Elton about relief from the parish ; he is very well to do himself , you know , being head man at the Crown , ostler , and every thing of that sort , but still he cannot keep his father without some help ; and so , when Mr . Elton came back , he told us what John ostler had been telling him , and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to Randalls to take Mr . Frank Churchill to Richmond .
" As a friend !"
We will not be parted .
We are growing a little too nice .
But this was not judged feasible .
Still , however , affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment .
You can have no superior , but most true on mine .-- She is a complete angel .
She had taken up a wrong idea , fancying it was a mother and daughter , a son and son ' s wife , who all lived together ; but when it appeared that the Mr . Martin , who bore a part in the narrative , and was always mentioned with approbation for his great good - nature in doing something or other , was a single man ; that there was no young Mrs . Martin , no wife in the case ; she did suspect danger to her poor little friend from all this hospitality and kindness , and that , if she were not taken care of , she might be required to sink herself forever .
She did not regret it .
" I agree with you exactly .
They arrived , the carriage turned , the step was let down , and Mr . Elton , spruce , black , and smiling , was with them instantly .
" But have you really heard of nothing ?"
That he should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before , passed suspiciously through Emma ' s brain ; but still , if it were a falsehood , it was a pleasant one , and pleasantly handled .
It is his companion all this evening , his solace , his delight .
Emma seriously hoped she would .
-- Bad enough as it is , for I absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree .-- I believe I have not played a bar this fortnight .-- However , he is coming , I assure you : yes , indeed , on purpose to wait on you all ."
And so then , in my nonsense , I could not help making a treasure of it -- so I put it by never to be used , and looked at it now and then as a great treat ."
Emma demurred .
She thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself , to have him with his grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her instead of his brother .
CHAPTER XIII
" How you can bear such recollections , is astonishing to me !-- They _will_ sometimes obtrude -- but how you can court them !"
He quitted the militia and engaged in trade , having brothers already established in a good way in London , which afforded him a favourable opening .
I never could have an idea of any body else -- and so I thought you knew .
" No -- I have never seen Mr . Elton ," she replied , starting on this appeal ; " is he -- is he a tall man ?"
Ten couple , in either of the Randalls rooms , would have been insufferable !-- Dreadful !-- I felt how right you were the whole time , but was too anxious for securing _any_ _thing_ to like to yield .
Mr . Knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment , and that not another syllable of communication could rest with him .
" Yes , to be sure , I suppose there are .
And Jane Fairfax , too , of all women !"
Our part of London is very superior to most others !-- You must not confound us with London in general , my dear sir .
" You are very obliging ; but as to all that , I am very indifferent ; it would be no object to me to be with the rich ; my mortifications , I think , would only be the greater ; I should suffer more from comparison .
You do us a great deal of honour to - day , I am sure .
Mrs . Elton was spoken of .
Mr . Knightley could not be there too often ; he should be glad to see him every day ;-- but they did see him every day as it was .-- Why could not they go on as they had done ?
