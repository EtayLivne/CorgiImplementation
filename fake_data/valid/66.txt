" How much I am obliged to you ," said he , " for telling me to come to - day !-- If it had not been for you , I should certainly have lost all the happiness of this party .
Upon such occasions poor Mr . Woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare .
" Trouble !
Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax .
We talked it all over with Mr . Weston last night .
" You will excuse my being so much over - powered .
He had done his duty and could return to his son .
I was late ; I met her walking home by herself , and wanted to walk with her , but she would not suffer it .
" Should I send it to Mrs . Goddard ' s , ma ' am ?"
Oh !
Papa is only speaking his own regret ."
We talked it all over with Mr . Weston last night .
Don ' t disturb him .
Weston !-- Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a gentlewoman !
How could you suppose me ignorant ?
" My idea of him is , that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of every body , and has the power as well as the wish of being universally agreeable .
said she ; ` well , that is quite unexpected .
" Something that would do !"
I never heard any county but Surry called so ."
He seemed hardly to hear her ; he was thoughtful -- and in a manner which shewed him not pleased , soon afterwards said ,
He would save himself from witnessing again such permitted , encouraged attentions .-- He had gone to learn to be indifferent .-- But he had gone to a wrong place .
I should not mind walking half the way .
He reads the Agricultural Reports , and some other books that lay in one of the window seats -- but he reads all _them_ to himself .
She was sorry , very sorry .
He would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided : she was sure he would not -- and she was expecting him every moment to escape into the card - room .
Harriet turned away ; but Emma could receive him with the usual smile , and her quick eye soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a push -- of having thrown a die ; and she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up .
Emma was most sincerely interested .
And as for Mrs . Hodges , Wright holds her very cheap indeed .-- She promised Wright a receipt , and never sent it ."
He could now , without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise , without a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest , give way to all his natural kind - hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after Mr . Frank Churchill ' s accommodation on his journey , through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road , and express very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold -- which , however , he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till after another night .
oh !
" Oh !
Escape , however , was not his plan .
It is a certainty .
" Very ."
Dear , Miss Woodhouse , I was absolutely miserable !
Mr . Dixon , you say , is not , strictly speaking , handsome ?"
They had not intended to go over till the summer , but she is so impatient to see them again -- for till she married , last October , she was never away from them so much as a week , which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms , I was going to say , but however different countries , and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her mother -- or her father , I declare I do not know which it was , but we shall see presently in Jane ' s letter -- wrote in Mr . Dixon ' s name as well as her own , to press their coming over directly , and they would give them the meeting in Dublin , and take them back to their country seat , Baly - craig , a beautiful place , I fancy .
I have no fears at all for myself ; and I should have no scruples of staying as late as Mrs . Weston , but on your account .
Do not pity me till I saw her wan , sick looks .-- I reached Highbury at the time of day when , from my knowledge of their late breakfast hour , I was certain of a good chance of finding her alone .-- I was not disappointed ; and at last I was not disappointed either in the object of my journey .
I was not aware of it myself .
And I hope she will be better off in one respect , and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long ."
" You think I ought to refuse him then ," said Harriet , looking down .
" We are sure of excellent fires ," continued he , " and every thing in the greatest comfort .
" Very true , Mr . Weston , perfectly true .
" Well , Miss Woodhouse !"
" Oh !
This is a sort of dull - looking evening , that ought to be treated rather as winter than summer .
As Frank Churchill ' s arrival had succeeded Mr . Elton ' s engagement in the conversation of Highbury , as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first , so now upon Frank Churchill ' s disappearance , Mr . Elton ' s concerns were assuming the most irresistible form .-- His wedding - day was named .
" As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again .
He does not care about Jane Fairfax .
He presently added , with a smile ,
Elton ?"
Mrs . Weston was disappointed .
Emma was just describing the nature of her friend ' s complaint ;-- " a throat very much inflamed , with a great deal of heat about her , a quick , low pulse , & c . and she was sorry to find from Mrs . Goddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore - throats , and had often alarmed her with them ."
Mr . Elton then turned back to accompany them .
" His father ' s marriage ," he said , " had been the wisest measure , every friend must rejoice in it ; and the family from whom he had received such a blessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation on him ."
You are not just to Harriet ' s claims .
cried Mr . John Knightley , hearing his own name .
Mr . Elton made his appearance .
" Ah !
She continued to look back , but in vain ; and soon , with what appeared unusual speed , they were half way down the hill , and every thing left far behind .
He had been at the pains of consulting Mr . Perry , the apothecary , on the subject .
I have another person ' s interest at present so much at heart , that I cannot think any longer about Frank Churchill .
Emma restrained her indignation , and only turned from her in silence .
I believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing - room that we are expecting Frank .
You know nothing of drawing .
you forget yourself -- you take me for my friend -- any message to Miss Smith I shall be happy to deliver ; but no more of this to _me_ , if you please ."
But she is really quite the gentlewoman ."
" That may be done without horses .
A week to - morrow !-- And I have hardly begun to enjoy myself .
Mrs . Dixon , I understand , has no remarkable degree of personal beauty ; is not , by any means , to be compared with Miss Fairfax ."
are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr .
She was sitting by Mr . Knightley , and turned to him for help .
" Me !"
Those who can barely live , and who live perforce in a very small , and generally very inferior , society , may well be illiberal and cross .
As to men and women , our opinions are sometimes very different ; but with regard to these children , I observe we never disagree ."
That is too young to settle .
They arrived , the carriage turned , the step was let down , and Mr . Elton , spruce , black , and smiling , was with them instantly .
Mr . Knightley , why do not you stay at home like poor Mr .
She must see more of him to understand his ways ; at present she only felt they were agreeable .
" What do you say to Mrs .
Lord of the earth and sea , he bends a slave , And woman , lovely woman , reigns alone .
She is pretty , and she is good tempered , and that is all .
Mrs . Bates and Mrs . Elton were together .
The rich brother - in - law near Bristol was the pride of the alliance , and his place and his carriages were the pride of him .
He asked me if he could do any thing .
" Exactly so -- The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth -- I have not a doubt of your success .
I shall , therefore , set off to - morrow .'
She was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms , at the poor attempt at rout - cakes , and there being no ice in the Highbury card - parties .
We really must wish you good night ."
Elton ?"
She was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement .
yes , I observed it , I assure you .
Emma was silenced .
CHAPTER III
And so then , in my nonsense , I could not help making a treasure of it -- so I put it by never to be used , and looked at it now and then as a great treat ."
The house belonged to people in business .
Emma laughed and disclaimed .
She seemed to propose shewing no agitation , or disappointment , or peculiar concern in the discovery .
" Is not she ?
