This is three times as large .-- And you have never any odd humours , my dear ."
They had stopped at Mrs . Bates ' s door to offer the use of their carriage , but the aunt and niece were to be brought by the Eltons .
" As to that -- I do not --"
It would amuse away the difficulties of her part , and lessen the irksomeness of Miss Smith ' s ."
-- but with many , many thanks --` there was no occasion to trouble us , for Mr . Knightley ' s carriage had brought , and was to take them home again .'
He was not an ill - tempered man , not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a reproach ; but his temper was not his great perfection ; and , indeed , with such a worshipping wife , it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not be increased .
No , he could not believe it a bad house ; not such a house as a man was to be pitied for having .
" Indeed I will .
Lively as he was , it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself ; but what decided her belief on the subject , was his staying only a quarter of an hour , and hurrying away to make other calls in Highbury .
I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly what every man delights in -- what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment .
Now , my dear madam , I will release you ; but I could not conclude before .
Many a time has Selina said , when she has been going to Bristol , ` I really cannot get this girl to move from the house .
A degree or two lower , and a creditable appearance might interest me ; I might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other .
" You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs . and Miss Bates ," said Emma , " I have not heard one inquiry after them ."
Oh !
She allowed him to talk , and arranged the glasses , and wrapped herself up , without opening her lips .
Woman ' s usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they are now ; or with no important variation .
There was a bustle on her approach ; a good deal of moving and talking .
It is a pity that they were ever got over ."
" Such sweet lines !"
It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball , which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy .-- She was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the Eltons , and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike ; and his praise of Harriet , his concession in her favour , was peculiarly gratifying .
.
Now I am secure of you for ever ."
" Oh !
-- Here was a sly glance at Emma .
The chances are that she must be a gainer ."
Emma ' s courage returned , and she walked on .
The Coxes were wondering last night whether she would get into any great family .
only think .
" Emma ," said Mr . Knightley presently , " I have a piece of news for you .
Had he said any thing to bear a different construction , I should not have believed him ."
She might assist his resolution , or reconcile him to it ; she might give just praise to Harriet , or , by representing to him his own independence , relieve him from that state of indecision , which must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his .-- They had reached the house .
oh !
From that moment , Emma could have taken her oath that Mr . Knightley had had no concern in giving the instrument .
she cried , looking aghast .
" When I have seen Mr . Elton ," replied Jane , " I dare say I shall be interested -- but I believe it requires _that_ with me .
Where is your merit ?
Emma was gratified , to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character , and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance .
-- and as clearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth .
On their first coming into the country , they had lived in proportion to their income , quietly , keeping little company , and that little unexpensively ; but the last year or two had brought them a considerable increase of means -- the house in town had yielded greater profits , and fortune in general had smiled on them .
" I do not often walk this way _now_ ," said Emma , as they proceeded , " but _then_ there will be an inducement , and I shall gradually get intimately acquainted with all the hedges , gates , pools and pollards of this part of Highbury ."
Emma will be happy to entertain you .
" Is not she ?
She merely said , in the course of some trivial chat , " Well , Harriet , whenever you marry I would advise you to do so and so "-- and thought no more of it , till after a minute ' s silence she heard Harriet say in a very serious tone , " I shall never marry ."
" To fall in with each other on such an errand as this ," thought Emma ; " to meet in a charitable scheme ; this will bring a great increase of love on each side .
She introduced him to her friend , Miss Smith , and , at convenient moments afterwards , heard what each thought of the other .
But I am not afraid of your seeing what he writes ."
I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town .
The possibility of the young man ' s coming to Mrs . Goddard ' s that morning , and meeting with Harriet and pleading his own cause , gave alarming ideas .
" Emma , I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do : a privilege rather endured than allowed , perhaps , but I must still use it .
They will be so very happy to see you ."
" You , who have been the best friend I ever had in my life -- Want gratitude to you !-- Nobody is equal to you !-- I care for nobody as I do for you !-- Oh !
Wickedness is always wickedness , but folly is not always folly .-- It depends upon the character of those who handle it .
James could take the note .
Her spirits seemed overcome .
there I am -- thinking of him directly .
And if poor little Anna Weston is to be spoiled , it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her as you have done for me , except falling in love with her when she is thirteen ."
" Ah !
" She must be very lively , and have hazle eyes .
Emma could not have a better companion than Harriet ."
" But , in spite of all her friends ' urgency , and her own wish of seeing Ireland , Miss Fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and Mrs .
He had left them completely frightened ; and Harriet eagerly clinging to him , and hardly able to speak , had just strength enough to reach Hartfield , before her spirits were quite overcome .
My greatest danger , perhaps , in housekeeping , may be quite the other way , in doing too much , and being too careless of expense .
Harriet listened , and Emma drew in peace .
But you see , every thing turns out for the best .
They had not been long seated and composed when Mr . Woodhouse , with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh , called his daughter ' s attention to the sad change at Hartfield since she had been there last .
When the ladies returned to the drawing - room after dinner , Emma found it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties ;-- with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did Mrs . Elton engross Jane Fairfax and slight herself .
Mrs . Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal of agitation herself ; and in the first place had wished not to go at all at present , to be allowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead , and to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed , and Mr . Churchill could be reconciled to the engagement ' s becoming known ; as , considering every thing , she thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports :-- but Mr . Weston had thought differently ; he was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her family , and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it ; or if it were , that it would be of any consequence ; for " such things ," he observed , " always got about ."
It must be her ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed ; and she hoped , that when able to see them together again , she might at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were .-- She should see them henceforward with the closest observance ; and wretchedly as she had hitherto misunderstood even those she was watching , she did not know how to admit that she could be blinded here .-- He was expected back every day .
It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked after her to church .
As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return , that was a mere joke ; he was afraid they would find no difficulty .
Elton ?"
That she was really ill was very certain ; he had declared himself convinced of it , at Randalls .
It was also a very early speculation with Emma .
Poor little creatures , how unhappy she would have made them !"
Mr . Knightley loves to find fault with me , you know -- in a joke -- it is all a joke .
She must not make it a more decided subject of misery to him , by a melancholy tone herself .
" You think I ought to refuse him then ," said Harriet , looking down .
How inconsiderate , how indelicate , how irrational , how unfeeling had been her conduct !
CHAPTER XVIII
" And while Mrs . Weston pays her visit , I may be allowed , I hope ," said Frank Churchill , " to join your party and wait for her at Hartfield -- if you are going home ."
" I am sorry to find , my love , that my father does not think you looking well -- but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued .
He was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter ; to escape a little from the latter , he went to the pianoforte , and begged Miss Fairfax , who was still sitting at it , to play something more .
My greatest danger , perhaps , in housekeeping , may be quite the other way , in doing too much , and being too careless of expense .
" Quite out of the question , quite out of the question ," he replied ;-- " but you must often wish it , I am sure ."
" Something has happened to delay her ; some visitors perhaps ."
You and I , Emma , will venture to take the part of the poor husband .
If Mr . and Mrs . Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning , we may talk it over , and see what can be done ."
They burst on him , I do not know how , but by some letter or message -- and it was the discovery of what she was doing , of this very project of hers , which determined him to come forward at once , own it all to his uncle , throw himself on his kindness , and , in short , put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been carrying on so long ."
" No -- I shall not stir .
Do not be impatient , Emma ; it will all come out too soon ."
Mr . Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile ; and succeeded without difficulty , upon Mrs . Elton ' s beginning to talk to him .
" I am afraid we must be running away ," said Emma , glancing at Harriet , and beginning to rise --" My father will be expecting us .
Another room of much better size might be secured for the purpose ; but it was at the other end of the house , and a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it .
She was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms , at the poor attempt at rout - cakes , and there being no ice in the Highbury card - parties .
" No -- he should not eat .
He is in Highbury every now and then , and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to Kingston .
Harriet could just answer , " Oh !
" So obliging of you !
Some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed , and others of the son and the uncle not letting him .
