" What two letters !-- express perfection !
A sudden freak seemed to have seized him at breakfast , and he had sent for a chaise and set off , intending to return to dinner , but with no more important view that appeared than having his hair cut .
" She will think Frank ought to ask her ."
I think , Emma , I shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us .
Jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour , and they had only accomplished some views of St . Mark ' s Place , Venice , when Frank Churchill entered the room .
They were laying themselves open to that very phrase -- and to having it sent off in a letter to Maple Grove by one lady , to Ireland by another .
There was no time for farther remark or explanation .
Emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love .
To youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma ' s , though under temporary gloom at night , the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of spirits .
you are too obliging !
She must not appear to think it a misfortune .-- With all the spirits she could command , she prepared him first for something strange , and then , in a few words , said , that if his consent and approbation could be obtained -- which , she trusted , would be attended with no difficulty , since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all -- she and Mr . Knightley meant to marry ; by which means Hartfield would receive the constant addition of that person ' s company whom she knew he loved , next to his daughters and Mrs . Weston , best in the world .
Emma could not forgive her ;-- but as neither provocation nor resentment were discerned by Mr . Knightley , who had been of the party , and had seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side , he was expressing the next morning , being at Hartfield again on business with Mr . Woodhouse , his approbation of the whole ; not so openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room , but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to Emma .
" I should not wonder ," said Mrs . Weston , " if Miss Fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination , by her aunt ' s eagerness in accepting Mrs . Elton ' s civilities for her .
There was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner .
" My mother ' s deafness is very trifling you see -- just nothing at all .
She has been gone longer already than she intended ."
But , unfortunately -- in short , if your compassion does not stand my friend --"
Your marrying will be equal to the match at Randalls .
I hope he will be calling soon .
She must see more of him to understand his ways ; at present she only felt they were agreeable .
The subject followed ; it was in plain , unaffected , gentlemanlike English , such as Mr . Knightley used even to the woman he was in love with , how to be able to ask her to marry him , without attacking the happiness of her father .
It had just occurred to Mrs . Weston that Mrs . Elton must be asked to begin the ball ; that she would expect it ; which interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction .-- Emma heard the sad truth with fortitude .
" Very bad -- though it might have been worse .-- Playing a most dangerous game .
Ambition , as well as love , had probably been mortified .
but her lips were closed .
If they are not put off , he cannot stir .
" No ,"-- he calmly replied ,--" there is but one married woman in the world whom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to Donwell , and that one is --"
She admired him for contriving it , though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it was announced .
" And then their uncle comes in , and tosses them up to the ceiling in a very frightful way !"
What were nine miles to a young man ?-- An hour ' s ride .
I meant only myself .
How well you put it on !-- so gratified !
" Not a walk in the rain , I should imagine ."
I told you he was plain ."
This is a connexion which offers nothing but good .
No suspicious flourishes now of apology or concern ; it was the language of real feeling towards Mrs . Weston ; and the transition from Highbury to Enscombe , the contrast between the places in some of the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt , and how much more might have been said but for the restraints of propriety .-- The charm of her own name was not wanting .
Much , much beyond impropriety !-- It has sunk him , I cannot say how it has sunk him in my opinion .
" Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills , I fancy ," observed Mr . John Knightley coolly .
He was very much vexed .
With this inspiriting notion , her questions increased in number and meaning ; and she particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr . Martin , and there was evidently no dislike to it .
It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax , whose prospects were closing , while Harriet ' s opened , and whose engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury , who wished to shew her kindness -- and with Emma it was grown into a first wish .
Mr . Suckling , who has been eleven years a resident at Maple Grove , and whose father had it before him -- I believe , at least -- I am almost sure that old Mr . Suckling had completed the purchase before his death ."
" Me !"
I met him just now .
Let every body on the Hill hear me if they can .
The substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma , in a note from Mrs . Weston , instantly .
It must not be : and yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance !--
They , in their different homes , and their different ways , might be looking back on it with pleasure ; but in her view it was a morning more completely misspent , more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time , and more to be abhorred in recollection , than any she had ever passed .
He gave me a quiet hint ; I told him he was mistaken ; he asked my pardon and said no more .
I am sure you did not much expect to like us .
" No , no ," said she , " you are quite unreasonable .
This event had very lately taken place ; too lately for any thing to be yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path of duty ; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had fixed on for beginning .
-- Those were Miss Woodhouse ' s words , were they ?-- And a fine ending -- and there is the letter .
" I have known her from a child , undoubtedly ; we have been children and women together ; and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate ,-- that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited her friends .
The picture which she had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter , had proved erroneous ; no friends had deserted them , no pleasures had been lost .-- But her present forebodings she feared would experience no similar contradiction .
A very few days had passed after this adventure , when Harriet came one morning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand , and after sitting down and hesitating , thus began :
The muffin last night -- if it had been handed round once , I think it would have been enough ."
She wanted to be alone .
at present I ask no more ."
" That is very likely .
This must not be ."
Does not she , Jane ?-- Do not we often talk of Mr . Frank Churchill ?-- Ah !
no , I could not endure William Coxe -- a pert young lawyer ."
A few more to - morrows , and the party from London would be arriving .
A very friendly shake of the hand , a very earnest " Good - bye ," closed the speech , and the door had soon shut out Frank Churchill .
" I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax ," said Emma .
" It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected .
Very happy to hear it .
She need not trouble herself to pity him .
" And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain .
Depend upon it , a man of six or seven - and - twenty can take care of himself ."
Mr . Elton , in very good spirits , was one of the first to walk in .
Pass Mr . E ., Knightley , Jane , and myself .
The weather does not look well , and grandmama will be uneasy .
" I am glad you think so ; and the good hands , I hope , may not be wanting ."
" He had been so fortunate as to -- I forget the precise words -- one has no business to remember them .
A reasonable visit paid , Mr . Weston began to move .--" He must be going .
It was now about the time that she was likely to call .
His face lengthened immediately ; and his voice was the voice of sentiment as he answered .
He has been opening the doors very often this evening , and keeping them open very inconsiderately .
They never could have been all three together , without her having stabbed Jane Fairfax ' s peace in a thousand instances ; and on Box Hill , perhaps , it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no more .
Do not defer it .
" Yes , oh !
Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be expected ; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits , which appeared perfectly natural , as there was a dentist to be consulted ; but , since that business had been over , she did not appear to find Harriet different from what she had known her before .-- Isabella , to be sure , was no very quick observer ; yet if Harriet had not been equal to playing with the children , it would not have escaped her .
I am a great advocate for timidity -- and I am sure one does not often meet with it .-- But in those who are at all inferior , it is extremely prepossessing .
It was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous as herself to avoid a meeting .
It was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself , and without one real , rational difficulty to oppose or delay it .
There was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his side -- but no love .
All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject , but I believed none of it .
He was so busy the last time he was at Kingston that he quite forgot it , but he goes again to - morrow .
Had he said any thing to bear a different construction , I should not have believed him ."
Soft is the very word for her eye -- of all epithets , the justest that could be given .
They are not at all the less written you know , because you divide them .
He had only himself to please in his choice : his fortune was his own ; for as to Frank , it was more than being tacitly brought up as his uncle ' s heir , it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume the name of Churchill on coming of age .
I do not pretend to it .
That will obviate all difficulties you know ; and from _us_ I really think , my dear Jane , you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation ."
She was the first to announce it to Mr . Knightley ; and exclaimed quite as much as was necessary , ( or , being acting a part , perhaps rather more ,) at the conduct of the Churchills , in keeping him away .
I was late ; I met her walking home by herself , and wanted to walk with her , but she would not suffer it .
" How ?-- They were invited , were not they ?"
I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point .
