" And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me ," said Emma , " and a very considerable one -- that I made the match myself .
The Woodhouses were first in consequence there .
All the minor arrangements of table and chair , lights and music , tea and supper , made themselves ; or were left as mere trifles to be settled at any time between Mrs . Weston and Mrs .
A large party secures its own amusement .
" Ah !
" It will be natural for me ," he added shortly afterwards , " to speak my opinion aloud as I read .
What right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged , and with manners so _very_ disengaged ?
You are quite mistaken .
" Jane Fairfax !-- Good God !
" Harriet , I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning .
And now , Miss Woodhouse , I do not think I shall mind seeing them again .
He had no reason to wish his hair longer , to conceal any confusion of face ; no reason to wish the money unspent , to improve his spirits .
So afraid you might have a headache !-- seeing you pass by so often , and knowing how much trouble you must have .
Even pleasure , you know , is fatiguing -- and I cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it .
With all my heart .
" Yes , they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London .
A worthy employment for a young lady ' s mind !
Her observation had been pretty correct .
-- Yet he would be so anxious for her being perfectly warm , would be so interested about her father , and so delighted with Mrs . Weston ; and at last would begin admiring her drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would - be lover , and made it some effort with her to preserve her good manners .
` Do not imagine , madam ,' she continued , ` that I was taught wrong .
I used to be quite angry with Selina ; but really I begin now to comprehend that a married woman has many things to call her attention .
He had made his fortune , bought his house , and obtained his wife ; and was beginning a new period of existence , with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through .
Harriet was remembered only from being _her_ friend .
Elton ."
Well , Miss Woodhouse , is he like what you expected ?
Emma assisted with her invention , memory and taste ; and as Harriet wrote a very pretty hand , it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order , in form as well as quantity .
" Oh !
" I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject ," replied Emma , smiling ; " but you do not mean to deny that there was a time -- and not very distant either -- when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him ?"
I , being a husband , and you not being a wife , the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force .
Frank Churchill ' s little inclination to exclude himself increased so much , that his last words to Emma were ,
" That ' s quite unnecessary ; I see Jane every day :-- but as you like .
She calls you , Knightley -- what can she do for Mr . Cole ?
" That is to say , you chose to have your walk , for you were not six yards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you ; and Henry and John had seen more drops than they could count long before .
It crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend ' s leaving Highbury , for the sake of her being settled so well .
But poor Harriet could not follow .
Some laughed , and answered good - humouredly .
When once it had been read , there was no doing any thing , but lament and exclaim .
Elton ."
Had he begun as he ought , there would have been no difficulty now ."
" I know you , I know you ; you would take up with any thing ; but I shall be a little more nice , and I am sure the good Campbells will be quite on my side ; with your superior talents , you have a right to move in the first circle .
The contrast between Mrs . Churchill ' s importance in the world , and Jane Fairfax ' s , struck her ; one was every thing , the other nothing -- and she sat musing on the difference of woman ' s destiny , and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed , till roused by Miss Bates ' s saying ,
Mrs . Weston looked up , afraid to believe ; but Emma ' s countenance was as steady as her words .
" Oh !
But whether he were entirely free from peculiar attachment -- whether there were no actual preference -- remained a little longer doubtful .
" You were mentioning May .
" A new neighbour for us all , Miss Woodhouse !"
These kind of things are very well at Christmas , when one is sitting round the fire ; but quite out of place , in my opinion , when one is exploring about the country in summer .
There is great fear , great caution , great resolution somewhere .-- She is _not_ to be with the _Dixons_ .
Instances have been known of young people passing many , many months successively , without being at any ball of any description , and no material injury accrue either to body or mind ;-- but when a beginning is made -- when the felicities of rapid motion have once been , though slightly , felt -- it must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more .
Another song , however , was soon begged for .
The word _home_ made his father look on him with fresh complacency .
" Oh !
She was sure of Mrs . Weston ' s wishing it to be communicated ; especially to one , who , like Mr . Knightley , had seen so much to blame in his conduct .
I suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere .
Her sensibilities , I suspect , are strong -- and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance , patience , self - controul ; but it wants openness .
To take her -- be it only an hour or two -- from her aunt , to give her change of air and scene , and quiet rational conversation , even for an hour or two , might do her good ; and the following morning she wrote again to say , in the most feeling language she could command , that she would call for her in the carriage at any hour that Jane would name -- mentioning that she had Mr . Perry ' s decided opinion , in favour of such exercise for his patient .
" What !"
" I think , Harriet , since your acquaintance with us , you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen , that you must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr . Martin .
` Can I do any thing for you at Kingston ?'
His good - nature , his humanity , as I tell you , would be quite enough to account for the horses .
It would not have been the awkwardness of a moment , it would have been rather a pleasure , previous to the suspicions of this very day ; she could have talked to him of Harriet , and the three - quarters of a mile would have seemed but one .
" I do not think he is conceited either , in general ," said Harriet , her conscience opposing such censure ; " at least , he is very good natured , and I shall always feel much obliged to him , and have a great regard for -- but that is quite a different thing from -- and you know , though he may like me , it does not follow that I should -- and certainly I must confess that since my visiting here I have seen people -- and if one comes to compare them , person and manners , there is no comparison at all , _one_ is so very handsome and agreeable .
I was there -- one of the party ."
Remember ."
It was not unlikely , she thought , that she might see Mr . Knightley in her way ; or , perhaps , he might come in while she were paying her visit .
snows a little I see ."
But they live very comfortably .
They will read together .
Emma , on reaching home , called the housekeeper directly , to an examination of her stores ; and some arrowroot of very superior quality was speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note .
A variety of evils crossed his mind .
I am quite ready .
And as for James , you may be very sure he will always like going to Randalls , because of his daughter ' s being housemaid there .
" There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _that_ ,"-- said Mr . Knightley , feelingly ; and for a moment or two he had done .
On their first coming into the country , they had lived in proportion to their income , quietly , keeping little company , and that little unexpensively ; but the last year or two had brought them a considerable increase of means -- the house in town had yielded greater profits , and fortune in general had smiled on them .
-- If he would say so to her at once , in the tone of decision becoming a man , there would be no opposition made to his going ."
While waiting for the carriage , she found Mr . Knightley by her side .
" What an excellent device ," said he , " the use of a sheepskin for carriages .
" Perfectly , perfectly right , my dearest Harriet ; you are doing just what you ought .
" Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her , or that she admired him ?"
Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs . Elton , though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her .
Very thoughtful of Colonel Campbell , was not it ?-- He knew Miss Fairfax could have no music here .
I am sure , rather than run the risk of hurting Mr . and Mrs . Cole , you would stay a little longer than you might wish .
Knightley .'
He always moved with the alertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory , but now he seemed more sudden than usual in his disappearance .
But you were humble .
What was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body ; and he had , therefore , earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any wedding - cake at all , and when that proved vain , as earnestly tried to prevent any body ' s eating it .
And I am sure , by his manner , it was no compliment .
And secretly she added to herself , " Lord bless me !
I have heard him speak with great animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with , who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece ."
I certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than I do .
According to Miss Bates -- it all came from her -- Mrs . Dixon had written most pressingly .
" Yes --( rather hesitatingly )-- I believe I do ."
Cannot you imagine , Mr . Knightley , what a _sensation_ his coming will produce ?
She felt that she should like to have had the power of refusal ; and afterwards , as the idea of the party to be assembled there , consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her , occurred again and again , she did not know that she might not have been tempted to accept .
She thought well of Frank in almost every respect ; and , what was more , she loved him very much , and her defence was , therefore , earnest .
" Thank you .
I cannot doubt it .
You look as if you would not do such a thing again ."
I want you to call me something else , but I do not know what ."
Mrs . Weston ' s friends were all made happy by her safety ; and if the satisfaction of her well - doing could be increased to Emma , it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl .
