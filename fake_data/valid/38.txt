And she talked in this way so long and successfully that , when forced to give her attention again to her father and sister , she had nothing worse to hear than Isabella ' s kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax ; and Jane Fairfax , though no great favourite with her in general , she was at that moment very happy to assist in praising .
There she is -- no , that ' s somebody else .
" No -- I have never seen Mr . Elton ," she replied , starting on this appeal ; " is he -- is he a tall man ?"
Either bathing has been of the greatest service to her , or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of Mr . Wingfield ' s , which we have been applying at times ever since August ."
Are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr . Martin and Harriet now are ?"
We seemed to understand each other .
Come , he knows himself there .
" You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill , I presume ," he continued -- " and know him to be my son , though he does not bear my name ."
poor Harriet !"
Your description of Mrs . Churchill made me think of them directly .
He gave her to understand that Frank admired her extremely -- thought her very beautiful and very charming ; and with so much to be said for him altogether , she found she must not judge him harshly .
If he were deficient there , nothing should make amends for it .
The superior degree of confidence towards Harriet , which this one article marked , gave her severe pain .
However , I do really think Mr . Martin a very amiable young man , and have a great opinion of him ; and his being so much attached to me -- and his writing such a letter -- but as to leaving you , it is what I would not do upon any consideration ."
I do not know .
He may be very ` aimable ,' have very good manners , and be very agreeable ; but he can have no English delicacy towards the feelings of other people : nothing really amiable about him ."
But I live out of the world , and am often astonished at what I hear .
It has been so many years my province to give advice , that you cannot be surprized , Mr . Knightley , at this little remains of office ."
A child on the watch , came towards them to beg ; and Miss Bickerton , excessively frightened , gave a great scream , and calling on Harriet to follow her , ran up a steep bank , cleared a slight hedge at the top , and made the best of her way by a short cut back to Highbury .
Oh !
Thy ready wit the word will soon supply , May its approval beam in that soft eye !
" We had better move on , Mr . Weston ," said she , " we are detaining the girls ."
True affection only could have prompted it ."
We shall have no occasion to open the windows at all -- not once the whole evening ; and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows , letting in cold air upon heated bodies , which ( as you well know , sir ) does the mischief ."
And then , her reserve -- I never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved ."
He did not know what they had best do .
Emma doubted the truth of this sentiment .
One cannot have too large a party .
As to her illness , all nothing of course .
I do not mean to set you against him , but indeed he is not quite the thing !"
A very few days brought the party from London , and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with Harriet , than she became perfectly satisfied -- unaccountable as it was !-- that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr . Knightley , and was now forming all her views of happiness .
She will not even listen to your questions .
She must be collected and calm .
You were very bad with the measles ; that is , you would have been very bad , but for Perry ' s great attention .
I am sure he has not the least idea of it .
" I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you ," said Mr . Weston .
" Mr . Elton , this is the most extraordinary conduct !
" Mrs . Dixon !
She had fallen into good hands , known nothing but kindness from the Campbells , and been given an excellent education .
Ford .-- " Yes -- no -- yes , to Mrs . Goddard ' s .
While I , to blind the world to our engagement , was behaving one hour with objectionable particularity to another woman , was she to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made every previous caution useless ?-- Had we been met walking together between Donwell and Highbury , the truth must have been suspected .-- I was mad enough , however , to resent .-- I doubted her affection .
She heard of her walking with the Eltons , sitting with the Eltons , spending a day with the Eltons !
Harriet listened , and Emma drew in peace .
" Mr . Weston do not trifle with me .-- Consider how many of my dearest friends are now in Brunswick Square .
She was , in fact , beginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing at all ; and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very disagreeable feelings , that , except in a moral light , as a penance , a lesson , a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind , she would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again .
He began -- stopping , however , almost directly to say , " Had I been offered the sight of one of this gentleman ' s letters to his mother - in - law a few months ago , Emma , it would not have been taken with such indifference ."
She could see nothing but evil in it .
She thought it was time to make up .
And having gone through what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement , and his persisting to act in direct opposition to Jane Fairfax ' s sense of right , he made a fuller pause to say , " This is very bad .-- He had induced her to place herself , for his sake , in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness , and it should have been his first object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarily .-- She must have had much more to contend with , in carrying on the correspondence , than he could .
What a blessing , that she never had any children !
He stopt again , rose again , and seemed quite embarrassed .-- He was more in love with her than Emma had supposed ; and who can say how it might have ended , if his father had not made his appearance ?
He was afraid poor Isabella would not like it .
Mrs . Elton ' s invitations I should have imagined any thing but inviting ."
" And if I did , ( which , however , I am far from allowing ) I should not feel that I had done wrong .
She had a little beauty and a little accomplishment , but so little judgment that she thought herself coming with superior knowledge of the world , to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood ; and conceived Miss Hawkins to have held such a place in society as Mrs . Elton ' s consequence only could surpass .
no doubt she had been suffering a great deal : more than any body had ever supposed -- and continual pain would try the temper .
" I believe I have been very rude ; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair in so odd a way -- so very odd a way -- that I cannot keep my eyes from her .
.
" How often we shall be going to see them , and they coming to see us !-- We shall be always meeting !
Oh !
Thank you , my mother is remarkably well .
" Very much to the honour of both ," was the handsome reply .
A Miss Hawkins of Bath .
That is , I _presume_ it to be so on her side , and I can _answer_ for its being so on his .
" How you can bear such recollections , is astonishing to me !-- They _will_ sometimes obtrude -- but how you can court them !"
I have seen a great many lists of her drawing - up at various times of books that she meant to read regularly through -- and very good lists they were -- very well chosen , and very neatly arranged -- sometimes alphabetically , and sometimes by some other rule .
I would be understood to mean , that it can be only weak , irresolute characters , ( whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance ,) who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience , an oppression for ever ."
We were speaking of it only yesterday , and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma , that there should be such a girl in Highbury for her to associate with .
At another time Emma might have been amused , but she was too much astonished now at Mr . Elton ' s spirits for other feelings .
at present I ask no more ."
CHAPTER XII
You may have done wrong with regard to Mr . Dixon , but this is a punishment beyond what you can have merited !-- The kindness and protection of Mrs .
I was sitting near the door -- Elizabeth saw me directly ; but he did not ; he was busy with the umbrella .
It was before tea -- stay -- no , it could not be before tea , because we were just going to cards -- and yet it was before tea , because I remember thinking -- Oh !
It was rather too late in the day to set about being simple - minded and ignorant ; but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of being humble and discreet , and repressing imagination all the rest of her life .
Miss Harriet Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast , though she is a very pretty girl .
Is this fair , Mrs .
For a little while Emma persevered in her silence ; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that letter might be too powerful , she thought it best to say ,
And he wrote as if he really loved her very much -- but she did not know -- and so , she was come as fast as she could to ask Miss Woodhouse what she should do .--" Emma was half - ashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful .
Will that do ?
" That appears quite wonderful .
I am sure he was particularly silent when Mrs . Cole told us of it at dinner ."
It is a sort of prologue to the play , a motto to the chapter ; and will be soon followed by matter - of - fact prose ."
" A very pleasant evening ," he began , as soon as Mr . Woodhouse had been talked into what was necessary , told that he understood , and the papers swept away ;--" particularly pleasant .
" What an amiable creature I was !-- No wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance ."
If Mr . Elton , on his return , made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do , she could not imagine Harriet ' s persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him .
I can allow for the fears of the child , but not of the man .
Mrs . Churchill was unwell -- far too unwell to do without him ; she had been in a very suffering state ( so said her husband ) when writing to her nephew two days before , though from her usual unwillingness to give pain , and constant habit of never thinking of herself , she had not mentioned it ; but now she was too ill to trifle , and must entreat him to set off for Enscombe without delay .
If _we_ exert ourselves , I think we shall not be long in want of allies .
The boy had , with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his mother ' s , been the means of a sort of reconciliation ; and Mr . and Mrs . Churchill , having no children of their own , nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for , offered to take the whole charge of the little Frank soon after her decease .
They were stopping , however , in the first place at Mrs . Bates ' s ; whose house was a little nearer Randalls than Ford ' s ; and had all but knocked , when Emma caught their eye .-- Immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her ; and the agreeableness of yesterday ' s engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting .
Mr . Knightley , what a delightful party last night ; how extremely pleasant .-- Did you ever see such dancing ?-- Was not it delightful ?-- Miss Woodhouse and Mr . Frank Churchill ; I never saw any thing equal to it ."
Mrs . Weston , you would be quite laid up ; do not let them talk of such a wild thing .
It must be done directly ; it must be done in London ; the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste could be depended on ; and Isabella , the usual doer of all commissions , must not be applied to , because it was December , and Mr . Woodhouse could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs of December .
" Harriet !"
" And do you see her , sir , tolerably often ?"
" How delighted I am to see you again !
I am determined against all interference .
_I_ think seriously of Miss Smith !-- Miss Smith is a very good sort of girl ; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled .
It was natural for him to feel that he had _cause_ to sigh .
