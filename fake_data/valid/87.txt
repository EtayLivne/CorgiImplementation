" He has been used to her in these complaints , and I hope to - morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report .
His information and prospects as to Enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated ; Mrs . Churchill was recovering , and he dared not yet , even in his own imagination , fix a time for coming to Randalls again .
" You may _say_ what you chuse -- but your countenance testifies that your _thoughts_ on this subject are very much like mine ."
There was no getting at her real opinion .
He did not suppose they could be damp now , in the middle of the day .
He continued ,
convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about Hartfield .
" Oh no !
" I cannot think there is any danger of it ," was Emma ' s calm answer -- " and when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax ' s situation and understand what her home has been , with Colonel and Mrs . Campbell , I have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown ."
Weston ?-- Judge between us .
" I told you yesterday ," cried Mr . Weston with exultation , " I told you all that he would be here before the time named .
You are very kind .
I shall never forget his flying Henry ' s kite for him that very windy day last Easter -- and ever since his particular kindness last September twelvemonth in writing that note , at twelve o ' clock at night , on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham , I have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence .-- If any body can deserve him , it must be Miss Taylor ."
Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young , handsome , rich , nor married .
It was the end of an old pencil ,-- the part without any lead .
" Well , well , I have that note ; and can shew it after dinner to convince Mr .
Miss Bates said a great deal ; Mrs . Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse ' s presiding ; Mr . Knightley ' s answer was the most distinct .
Heavens !
" Perry !"
I made the match , you know , four years ago ; and to have it take place , and be proved in the right , when so many people said Mr . Weston would never marry again , may comfort me for any thing ."
" But your father is not going so far ; he is only going to the Crown , quite on the other side of the street , and there are a great many houses ; you might be very much at a loss , and it is a very dirty walk , unless you keep on the footpath ; but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street ."
The aunt was a capricious woman , and governed her husband entirely ; but it was not in Mr . Weston ' s nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear , and , as he believed , so deservedly dear .
" Yes , indeed , a very good letter ," replied Emma rather slowly --" so good a letter , Harriet , that every thing considered , I think one of his sisters must have helped him .
" Well , my dear ," he deliberately began , " considering we never saw her before , she seems a very pretty sort of young lady ; and I dare say she was very much pleased with you .
Nothing , but that the lessons of her past folly might teach her humility and circumspection in future .
" Ah !
Mrs . Elton then said , " Nobody can think less of dress in general than I do -- but upon such an occasion as this , when every body ' s eyes are so much upon me , and in compliment to the Westons -- who I have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour -- I would not wish to be inferior to others .
" I do not ask whether you are musical , Mrs . Elton .
That ' s right .
" By the bye -- I have not wished you joy .
I will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you ."
There was a bustle on her approach ; a good deal of moving and talking .
" How very pleasing and proper of him !"
Emma ' s going away directly after tea might be giving offence .
Harriet was remembered only from being _her_ friend .
After waiting a moment , as if to be sure she intended to say no more , he replied ,
But , on the other hand , she could not admit herself to be unhappy , nor , after the first morning , to be less disposed for employment than usual ; she was still busy and cheerful ; and , pleasing as he was , she could yet imagine him to have faults ; and farther , though thinking of him so much , and , as she sat drawing or working , forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment , fancying interesting dialogues , and inventing elegant letters ; the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she _refused_ _him_ .
I am afraid you must have had a shocking walk ."
She then began to speak of you , and of the great kindness you had shewn her during her illness ; and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected , desired me , whenever I had an opportunity , to thank you -- I could not thank you too much -- for every wish and every endeavour to do her good .
this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of their lives , as my father informs me .
He had been sitting with her , it appeared , most companionably at home , till her usual hour of exercise ; and on being desired to chuse their walk , immediately fixed on Highbury .--" He did not doubt there being very pleasant walks in every direction , but if left to him , he should always chuse the same .
A little upstart , vulgar being , with her Mr . E ., and her _caro_ _sposo_ , and her resources , and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery .
.
I must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me , as to that .
I almost long to attempt her likeness myself .
While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to myself , but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation in approving .
He stopped in his earnestness to look the question , and the expression of his eyes overpowered her .
Happily he was not farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing it .-- Though always objecting to every marriage that was arranged , he never suffered beforehand from the apprehension of any ; it seemed as if he could not think so ill of any two persons ' understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it were proved against them .
He has a wife and family to maintain , and is not to be giving away his time .
It will be bad enough for the horses ."
A walk before breakfast does me good ."
" Prejudiced !
a fine complimentary opening : But it is his way .
The list she drew up when only fourteen -- I remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit , that I preserved it some time ; and I dare say she may have made out a very good list now .
The possibility of the young man ' s coming to Mrs . Goddard ' s that morning , and meeting with Harriet and pleading his own cause , gave alarming ideas .
Upon the whole , Emma left her with such softened , charitable feelings , as made her look around in walking home , and lament that Highbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence ; nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her .
It was accepted ; and from that period Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell ' s family , and had lived with them entirely , only visiting her grandmother from time to time .
" I am to hear from him soon ," continued Mrs . Weston .
She went on herself , to give that portion of time to an old servant who was married , and settled in Donwell .
" I met William Larkins ," continued Mr . Elton , " as I got near the house , and he told me I should not find his master at home , but I did not believe him .-- William seemed rather out of humour .
" I do not offer it for Miss Smith ' s collection ," said he .
" She loves him then excessively , I suppose .
And he is a very clever boy , indeed .
At another time Emma might have been amused , but she was too much astonished now at Mr . Elton ' s spirits for other feelings .
" I lay it down as a general rule , Harriet , that if a woman _doubts_ as to whether she should accept a man or not , she certainly ought to refuse him .
He only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself ; and if Miss Woodhouse of Hartfield , the heiress of thirty thousand pounds , were not quite so easily obtained as he had fancied , he would soon try for Miss Somebody else with twenty , or with ten .
They are some of my very old friends .
There are secrets in all families , you know )-- The case is , that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in January ; and that Frank ' s coming depends upon their being put off .
" Your parish there was small ," said Jane .
While he talked to Isabella , however , Emma found an opportunity of saying ,
By doing it , I shall feel that I am near you .
This was the fact .
I believe I did not play with the children quite so much as usual .
You may be very sure I shall always take care of _them_ ."
The ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant , " Men never know when things are dirty or not ;" and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to himself , " Women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares ."
How very odd !
" Her friends must all be sorry to lose her ; and will not Colonel and Mrs . Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their return ?"
It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned .
But the idea of any thing to be done in a _moment_ , was increasing , not lessening , Mr . Woodhouse ' s agitation .
A word was put in for a second young Cox ; and at last , Mr . Weston naming one family of cousins who must be included , and another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out , it became a certainty that the five couple would be at least ten , and a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they could be disposed of .
" I have the greatest pleasure , my dear Emma , in forwarding to you the enclosed .
" Well !
Mr . Cole said how much taste you had ; and Mr . Frank Churchill talked a great deal about your taste , and that he valued taste much more than execution ."
To Highbury in general it brought no material change .
And if he were to be lost to them for Harriet ' s sake ; if he were to be thought of hereafter , as finding in Harriet ' s society all that he wanted ; if Harriet were to be the chosen , the first , the dearest , the friend , the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence ; what could be increasing Emma ' s wretchedness but the reflection never far distant from her mind , that it had been all her own work ?
It could not be otherwise .
The preparing and the going abroad in such weather , with the sacrifice of his children after dinner , were evils , were disagreeables at least , which Mr . John Knightley did not by any means like ; he anticipated nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase ; and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his discontent .
Emma could hardly understand him ; he seemed in an odd humour .
He thought we walked towards Randalls most days .
" He has not been here yet ," replied Emma .
We had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all .
Harriet was to sit again the next day ; and Mr . Elton , just as he ought , entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again .
And there was time enough for Emma to form a reasonable judgment , as their visit included all the rest of the morning .
Now I cannot say , that I think you are any of you looking well at present ."
As a magistrate , he had generally some point of law to consult John about , or , at least , some curious anecdote to give ; and as a farmer , as keeping in hand the home - farm at Donwell , he had to tell what every field was to bear next year , and to give all such local information as could not fail of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his life , and whose attachments were strong .
Take your own ."
.
The appearance of the little sitting - room as they entered , was tranquillity itself ; Mrs . Bates , deprived of her usual employment , slumbering on one side of the fire , Frank Churchill , at a table near her , most deedily occupied about her spectacles , and Jane Fairfax , standing with her back to them , intent on her pianoforte .
" Have you indeed no idea ?"
" Very well ; I will not plague you any more .
