But I do not like the corner into Vicarage Lane ."
I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else .
She had talked her into love ; but , alas !
I doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it ."
Now , according to my idea of Mrs . Churchill , it would be most natural , that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband , to whom she owes every thing , while she exercises incessant caprice towards _him_ , she should frequently be governed by the nephew , to whom she owes nothing at all ."
Mrs . Weston -- it is too calm a censure .
She was quick in feeling the little injuries to Isabella , which Isabella never felt herself .
She would keep the peace if possible ; and there was something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits , the all - sufficiency of home to himself , whence resulted her brother ' s disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse , and those to whom it was important .-- It had a high claim to forbearance .
He gave her a letter , it was from Frank , and to herself ; he had met with it in his way , and had taken the liberty of opening it .
Don ' t let us be severe , don ' t let us be in a hurry to condemn him .
You are very fond of bending little minds ; but where little minds belong to rich people in authority , I think they have a knack of swelling out , till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones .
And there was time enough for Emma to form a reasonable judgment , as their visit included all the rest of the morning .
So much superadded decision of character !
And , besides , I must give you a hint , Frank ; any want of attention to her _here_ should be carefully avoided .
Mr . Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile ; and succeeded without difficulty , upon Mrs . Elton ' s beginning to talk to him .
" Ah !-- Indeed I am very sorry .-- Come , shake hands with me ."
My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the table spread in the dining - room .
On his side were the inquiries ,--" Was she a horsewoman ?-- Pleasant rides ?-- Pleasant walks ?-- Had they a large neighbourhood ?-- Highbury , perhaps , afforded society enough ?-- There were several very pretty houses in and about it .-- Balls -- had they balls ?-- Was it a musical society ?"
This little explanation with Mr . Knightley gave Emma considerable pleasure .
I went for only one night , and could not get away till that very day se ' nnight ."
I would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible ."
Mr . Knightley , in fact , was one of the few people who could see faults in Emma Woodhouse , and the only one who ever told her of them : and though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself , she knew it would be so much less so to her father , that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body .
" They would have solicited the honour earlier , but had been waiting the arrival of a folding - screen from London , which they hoped might keep Mr . Woodhouse from any draught of air , and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour of his company ."
He has a great regard for the Bateses , you know , independent of Jane Fairfax -- and is always glad to shew them attention .
You will not like the noise ."
But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge !
_What_ she was , must be uncertain ; but _who_ she was , might be found out ; and setting aside the 10 , 000 l ., it did not appear that she was at all Harriet ' s superior .
I have no pleasure in seeing my friends , unless I can believe myself fit to be seen ."
And in this style he talked on for some time very properly , not much attending to any answer , but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat ; and Emma was quite in charity with him .
" Oh !
cried he .
We had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all .
" I like your plan ," cried Mr . Weston .
To restrain him as much as might be , by her own manners , she was immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the weather and the night ; but scarcely had she begun , scarcely had they passed the sweep - gate and joined the other carriage , than she found her subject cut up -- her hand seized -- her attention demanded , and Mr . Elton actually making violent love to her : availing himself of the precious opportunity , declaring sentiments which must be already well known , hoping -- fearing -- adoring -- ready to die if she refused him ; but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect , and in short , very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible .
Yet he would speak .
" Quite seasonable ; and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin yesterday , and prevent this day ' s party , which it might very possibly have done , for Mr . Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been much snow on the ground ; but now it is of no consequence .
Emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from their knowing each other , which had taken strong possession of her mind , had ever crossed his ; and whether his compliments were to be considered as marks of acquiescence , or proofs of defiance .
My charge would be much more concise than her ' s , and probably not much in the same spirit ; all that I have to recommend being comprised in , do not spoil them , and do not physic them ."
Mr . and Mrs . John Knightley were to come down in August , and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back .
Mr . Weston , do not mistake me .
This proves that he can leave the Churchills ."
The sitting was altogether very satisfactory ; she was quite enough pleased with the first day ' s sketch to wish to go on .
Knightley ."
Now , it would be really having Frank in their neighbourhood .
It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball , which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy .-- She was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the Eltons , and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike ; and his praise of Harriet , his concession in her favour , was peculiarly gratifying .
Just like her !
Do not defer it .
But you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield .
" It is very natural .
Your resolution , or rather your expectation of never marrying , results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer , would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you .
" I have not even made any inquiry ; I do not wish to make any yet ."
That was what happened before tea .
" To be sure ," said Harriet , in a mortified voice , " he is not so genteel as real gentlemen ."
Never had she felt so agitated , mortified , grieved , at any circumstance in her life .
And here I can admit , that my manners to Miss W ., in being unpleasant to Miss F ., were highly blameable .
I think Miss Fairfax dances very well ; and Mrs . Weston is the very best country - dance player , without exception , in England .
After being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from Mr . and Mrs . Suckling , the Highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn .
yes -- she will have her own room , of course ; the room she always has ;-- and there is the nursery for the children ,-- just as usual , you know .
I shall have many fellow - mourners for the ball , if not for Frank Churchill ; but Mr . Knightley will be happy .
The looking over his letter again , in replying to it , had such a softening tendency , that it was particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions ; and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy , and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say , and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful , that Emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment , he would have been accepted after all .
" I dare say ," returned Harriet , sighing again , " I dare say she was very much attached to him ."
He was not in his best spirits , but seemed trying to improve them ; and , at last , made himself talk nonsense very agreeably .
Under a bright mid - day sun , at almost Midsummer , Mr . Woodhouse was safely conveyed in his carriage , with one window down , to partake of this al - fresco party ; and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the Abbey , especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning , he was happily placed , quite at his ease , ready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved , and advise every body to come and sit down , and not to heat themselves .-- Mrs . Weston , who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired , and sit all the time with him , remained , when all the others were invited or persuaded out , his patient listener and sympathiser .
" Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ ," said Frank Churchill , with a smile at Emma , " the person has not chosen ill .
And Jane Fairfax , too , of all women !"
" If we were in the other room ," said Emma , " if I had my writing - desk , I am sure I could produce a specimen .
" Harriet , poor Harriet !"
I give you notice -- You will find me a formidable antagonist on that point .
For his own sake , I would not have him do so mad a thing ."
But you are too good for that , I am sure ."
She had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself .
_Now_ I shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you ."
The delightful family party which Emma was securing for herself , poor Harriet must , in mere charitable caution , be kept at a distance from .
" Mr . Knightley ' s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare Mr . Martin with _him_ .
" Indifferent !
" Very bad -- though it might have been worse .-- Playing a most dangerous game .
The dread of being awakened from the happiest dream , was perhaps the most prominent feeling .
But just got acquainted with Mrs . Weston , and others !-- I hate the recollection ."
" I am ready ," said Emma , " whenever I am wanted ."
She would not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match for her , hereafter , with either of Isabella ' s sons ; but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best .
She had been thinking of him the moment before , as unquestionably sixteen miles distant .-- There was time only for the quickest arrangement of mind .
At last Jane began , and though the first bars were feebly given , the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to .
You quite shock me ; if you mean a fling at the slave - trade , I assure you Mr . Suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition ."
The name makes me think of poor Isabella ; for she was very near being christened Catherine after her grandmama .
It is not likely you should ever have observed him ; but he knows you very well indeed -- I mean by sight ."
Mr . Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile ; and succeeded without difficulty , upon Mrs . Elton ' s beginning to talk to him .
You should have consulted Perry ."
Her father was growing nervous , and could not understand _her_ .
You , ( to Emma ), I am certain , will never guess .-- I will tell you .-- M .
" Ah !
You do us a great deal of honour to - day , I am sure .
" Miss Woodhouse has given her friend the only beauty she wanted ,"-- observed Mrs . Weston to him -- not in the least suspecting that she was addressing a lover .--" The expression of the eye is most correct , but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes .
` Oh !'
A Miss Hawkins of Bath .
How do you do , Mr .
Besides , she is out of health now ; but _that_ indeed , by her own account , she has always been .
An express arrived at Randalls to announce the death of Mrs . Churchill !
Perhaps he wanted to speak to her , of his attachment to Harriet ; he might be watching for encouragement to begin .-- She did not , could not , feel equal to lead the way to any such subject .
" I am very glad , indeed , my dear , to hear she is to be so comfortably settled .
papa , we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married .
