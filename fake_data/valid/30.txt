Mrs . Elton , very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her by such a hope , smiled most graciously .
Her cheeks flushed at the name , and she felt afraid of something , though she knew not what .
A single woman , with a very narrow income , must be a ridiculous , disagreeable old maid !
" So obliging of you !
Harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion , with great self - command .
This must not be ."
He looked around , as if to see that no one were near , and then said ,
I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith .
" I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father -- or even may be some encumbrance to you , if your visiting engagements continue to increase as much as they have done lately ."
The delightful assurance of her total indifference towards Frank Churchill , of her having a heart completely disengaged from him , had given birth to the hope , that , in time , he might gain her affection himself ;-- but it had been no present hope -- he had only , in the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment , aspired to be told that she did not forbid his attempt to attach her .-- The superior hopes which gradually opened were so much the more enchanting .-- The affection , which he had been asking to be allowed to create , if he could , was already his !-- Within half an hour , he had passed from a thoroughly distressed state of mind , to something so like perfect happiness , that it could bear no other name .
" She thinks herself wrong , then , for having consented to a private engagement ?"
" Yes , yes -- but I am amused that he should have seen so far into my feelings .
Here , she must be leading a life of privation and penance ; there it would have been all enjoyment .
Don ' t pretend to be in raptures about mine .
Emma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party , and grew uncomfortable .
They were going to take the two eldest boys to Astley ' s .
Emma divined what every body present must be thinking .
No , if he had believed me at all to share his feelings , he would not have been so wretched .
" You are not quite so miserable , though , as when you first came .
said she , as they proceeded -- speaking more to assist Mr . Weston in keeping his secret , than with any other view .
Did not keep the horses a moment .
The hasty engagement she had entered into with that woman -- Here , my dear madam , I was obliged to leave off abruptly , to recollect and compose myself .-- I have been walking over the country , and am now , I hope , rational enough to make the rest of my letter what it ought to be .-- It is , in fact , a most mortifying retrospect for me .
" And then , he saved her life .
He could be no judge , however , of the evil he was holding cheap .
She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith ' s conversation , but she found her altogether very engaging -- not inconveniently shy , not unwilling to talk -- and yet so far from pushing , shewing so proper and becoming a deference , seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to Hartfield , and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to , that she must have good sense , and deserve encouragement .
I have some notion of putting such a trimming as this to my white and silver poplin .
He sat a little while in doubt .
To you , he will talk of farming ; to me , of drawing or music ; and so on to every body , having that general information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead , or take the lead , just as propriety may require , and to speak extremely well on each ; that is my idea of him ."
She was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other .
I am not in the least ashamed of my meaning ."
Mrs . Perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage , and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed .
It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were at Hartfield , which made their presence so acceptable ; for though her first remark , on reading it , was that " of course it must be declined ," she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do , that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful .
" I am very much obliged to you ," said Emma , laughing again .
Do not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration .
what would Frank Churchill say to her , if he were here ?
Half a dozen natural children , perhaps -- and poor Frank cut off !-- This , though very undesirable , would be no matter of agony to her .
The pain of his continued residence in Highbury , however , must certainly be lessened by his marriage .
and to see you in such excellent looks !-- I would not have missed this meeting for the world .
" Oh !
" Aye -- like Maple Grove , I dare say .
" Yes -- entirely her own doing , entirely her own choice ; and Colonel and Mrs . Campbell think she does quite right , just what they should recommend ; and indeed they particularly _wish_ her to try her native air , as she has not been quite so well as usual lately ."
They , in their different homes , and their different ways , might be looking back on it with pleasure ; but in her view it was a morning more completely misspent , more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time , and more to be abhorred in recollection , than any she had ever passed .
Emma restrained her indignation , and only turned from her in silence .
A letter arrived from Mr . Churchill to urge his nephew ' s instant return .
" Yes ," said his brother hesitatingly , " there is a likeness .
As he became rational , he ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in their authority .
There must be three months , at least , of deep mourning ; but when they are over , I imagine there will be nothing more to wait for ."
" Ungrateful !-- What do you mean ?"
-- Which you know shewed him to be so very .
The error has been all my own ; and I do assure you that , with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give , I shall yet dread making the story known to Colonel Campbell .'"
I have no pleasure in seeing my friends , unless I can believe myself fit to be seen ."
And soon afterwards , " Jane Fairfax is a very charming young woman -- but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect .
she cried with a most open eagerness --" Never , for the twentieth part of a moment , did such an idea occur to me .
Only my pattern gown is at Hartfield .
I was convinced there were two , and there is but one .
She hoped they might now become friends again .
She was received with a cordial respect which could not but please , and given all the consequence she could wish for .
She knew that at times she must be missed ; and could not think , without pain , of Emma ' s losing a single pleasure , or suffering an hour ' s ennui , from the want of her companionableness : but dear Emma was of no feeble character ; she was more equal to her situation than most girls would have been , and had sense , and energy , and spirits that might be hoped would bear her well and happily through its little difficulties and privations .
" I thought he meant to try his skill , by his manner of declining it yesterday ."
She might assist his resolution , or reconcile him to it ; she might give just praise to Harriet , or , by representing to him his own independence , relieve him from that state of indecision , which must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his .-- They had reached the house .
said she ; ` well , that is quite unexpected .
You will not see him .
for shame !"
He had time only to say ,
You would not have been so long in coming , if you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury ."
I was very much pleased with all that he said .
Mr . Elton is good - humoured , cheerful , obliging , and gentle .
Much better employed talking to the young ladies .
She said no more , other subjects took their turn ; and the rest of the dinner passed away ; the dessert succeeded , the children came in , and were talked to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation ; a few clever things said , a few downright silly , but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the other -- nothing worse than everyday remarks , dull repetitions , old news , and heavy jokes .
" For shame , Emma !
The naivete of Miss Smith ' s manners -- and altogether -- Oh , it is most admirable !
Frank ' s was the first idea ; and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it ; for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties , and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance .
And that you should have been so mistaken , is amazing !-- I am sure , but for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment , I should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost , to dare to think of him .
She continued to look back , but in vain ; and soon , with what appeared unusual speed , they were half way down the hill , and every thing left far behind .
she was as grateful as possible , you may be sure .
You like Mr . Elton , papa ,-- I must look about for a wife for him .
It opens his designs to his family , it introduces you among them , it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature , eager curiosity and warm prepossession .
You are not serious ?
I will do my best .
He had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted , and her tongue motionless .
" As to the circumstances of her birth , though in a legal sense she may be called Nobody , it will not hold in common sense .
Can the old lady ?"
He praised her for being without art or affectation , for having simple , honest , generous , feelings .-- She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet ; he had dwelt on them to her more than once .-- Much that lived in Harriet ' s memory , many little particulars of the notice she had received from him , a look , a speech , a removal from one chair to another , a compliment implied , a preference inferred , had been unnoticed , because unsuspected , by Emma .
Well , Mr . Knightley , and so you actually saw the letter ; well --"
So Emma thought , at least .
It was settled that they should go to Box Hill .
Dixon is very musical , is he ?
" Prejudiced !
She felt that , in quitting Donwell , he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits ; that in living constantly with her father , and in no house of his own , there would be much , very much , to be borne with .
From that evening , or at least from the time of Miss Woodhouse ' s encouraging her to think of him , Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he had been used to do , and of his having indeed quite a different manner towards her ; a manner of kindness and sweetness !-- Latterly she had been more and more aware of it .
" Worse than I had supposed .
" To fall in with each other on such an errand as this ," thought Emma ; " to meet in a charitable scheme ; this will bring a great increase of love on each side .
" Emma never thinks of herself , if she can do good to others ," rejoined Mr . Woodhouse , understanding but in part .
" Ah !
There , it is done .
Her youth had passed without distinction , and her middle of life was devoted to the care of a failing mother , and the endeavour to make a small income go as far as possible .
If not wise or refined herself , she would have connected him with those who were ; but Miss Hawkins , it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit , had been the best of her own set .
Her eyes , a deep grey , with dark eye - lashes and eyebrows , had never been denied their praise ; but the skin , which she had been used to cavil at , as wanting colour , had a clearness and delicacy which really needed no fuller bloom .
She was obliged to leave the door ajar as she found it ; but she fully intended that Mr . Elton should close it .
Don ' t disturb him .
