Her own father ' s perfect exemption from any thought of the kind , the entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion , was a most comfortable circumstance .
It was settled that they should go to Box Hill .
" My dear , you are too particular ," said her husband .
Do not tell his father , but that young man is not quite the thing .
Think , then , what I must have endured in hearing it bandied between the Eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition , and all the insolence of imaginary superiority .
" Yes , yes , pray pass _me_ ," added her husband , with a sort of sneering consciousness ; " _I_ have nothing to say that can entertain Miss Woodhouse , or any other young lady .
She was your governess , I think ?"
" It is so , indeed ," continued Mr . Knightley ; " I have it from Robert Martin himself .
" I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character , have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before ."
I shall see you at the Abbey to - morrow morning I hope , and then we will look them over , and you shall give me your opinion ."
They will have their barouche - landau , of course , which holds four perfectly ; and therefore , without saying any thing of _our_ carriage , we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well .
They met with the utmost friendliness .
" But there may be pretty good guessing .
-- But , in spite of these deficiencies , the wishes , the hopes , the confidence , the predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the ceremony , were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union .
With regard to her not accompanying them to Ireland , her account to her aunt contained nothing but truth , though there might be some truths not told .
I shall always have a great regard for the Miss Martins , especially Elizabeth , and should be very sorry to give them up , for they are quite as well educated as me .
It will be felt so great an attention !
" Don ' t say I was cross .
Either bathing has been of the greatest service to her , or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of Mr . Wingfield ' s , which we have been applying at times ever since August ."
A sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded by her general state , had carried her off after a short struggle .
I must love him ; and now that I am satisfied on one point , the one material point , I am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well , and ready to hope that it may .
So mild and ladylike -- and with such talents !-- I assure you I think she has very extraordinary talents .
I dared not address her openly ; my difficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well known to require definition ; and I was fortunate enough to prevail , before we parted at Weymouth , and to induce the most upright female mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement .-- Had she refused , I should have gone mad .-- But you will be ready to say , what was your hope in doing this ?-- What did you look forward to ?-- To any thing , every thing -- to time , chance , circumstance , slow effects , sudden bursts , perseverance and weariness , health and sickness .
It was a pity , perhaps , that he had not come last night ; for , though the child seemed well now , very well considering , it would probably have been better if Perry had seen it ."
It reminded her of their first forlorn tete - a - tete , on the evening of Mrs . Weston ' s wedding - day ; but Mr . Knightley had walked in then , soon after tea , and dissipated every melancholy fancy .
He does not read ?"
Mrs . Weston ' s friends were all made happy by her safety ; and if the satisfaction of her well - doing could be increased to Emma , it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl .
" If a woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself , it is in a situation like Jane Fairfax ' s .-- Of such , one may almost say , that ` the world is not their ' s , nor the world ' s law .'"
" I do not believe any such thing ," replied Emma .--" I am persuaded that you can be as insincere as your neighbours , when it is necessary ; but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent .
I never was more surprized -- but it does not make me unhappy , I assure you .-- How -- how has it been possible ?"
With some there was great joy at the sight of Frank Churchill ; others took it very composedly ; but there was a very general distress and disturbance on Miss Fairfax ' s disappearance being explained .
You blush , Harriet .-- Does any body else occur to you at this moment under such a definition ?
Mr . Elton knows you ."
Seldom , very seldom , does complete truth belong to any human disclosure ; seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised , or a little mistaken ; but where , as in this case , though the conduct is mistaken , the feelings are not , it may not be very material .-- Mr . Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than she possessed , or a heart more disposed to accept of his .
What is all this ?"
" I had only my own family to study from .
Mrs . Weston looked , and looked in vain .
I had quite determined to go away again ."
I could very ill be spared -- but such a point had been made of my coming !
" Miss Woodhouse , as you will not give me your opinion , I must do as well as I can by myself ; and I have now quite determined , and really almost made up my mind -- to refuse Mr . Martin .
Miss Fairfax , you must not run such risks .-- Liable as you have been to severe colds , indeed you ought to be particularly careful , especially at this time of year .
To guess what all this meant , was impossible even for Emma .
" It is too small -- wants strength .
I think he is just the person to do it , even without being in love ."
What ever she might feel of brighter hope , she betrayed nothing .
For some weeks past she had been spending more than half her time there , and gradually getting to have a bed - room appropriated to herself ; and Emma judged it best in every respect , safest and kindest , to keep her with them as much as possible just at present .
Her looks and words had nothing to restrain them .
You will be adored in Highbury .
" Oh !
He will connect himself well if he can ."
But now I seem to feel that I may deserve him ; and that if he does chuse me , it will not be any thing so very wonderful ."
Busy as he was , however , the young man was yet able to shew a most happy countenance on seeing Emma again .
You , who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on these subjects , who must have been so deep in the business on Miss Campbell ' s account -- we shall not excuse your being indifferent about Mr . Elton and Miss Hawkins ."
" Almost every moment .
" Such attentions as Mrs . Elton ' s , I should have imagined , would rather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax .
It was not the gipsies -- it was not Mr . Frank Churchill that I meant .
When the Campbells are returned , we shall meet them in London , and continue there , I trust , till we may carry her northward .-- But now , I am at such a distance from her -- is not it hard , Miss Woodhouse ?-- Till this morning , we have not once met since the day of reconciliation .
Look at my shoes .
That would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance !
" Yes ; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction .
" Well -- but if any difficulties should arise , my housekeeper is extremely clever ."
She was the first to announce it to Mr . Knightley ; and exclaimed quite as much as was necessary , ( or , being acting a part , perhaps rather more ,) at the conduct of the Churchills , in keeping him away .
How could you suppose me ignorant ?
" Oh !
Weston .-- " Very well , I thank you , ma ' am .
" Mr . Knightley and Jane Fairfax !"
" Mermaids and sharks !
Well , I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland ."
The service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart ."
This is what we all feel .
All looked up to them .
She is his principal correspondent , I assure you .
" I shall never let that book go out of my own hands ," said she .
" Her friends must all be sorry to lose her ; and will not Colonel and Mrs . Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their return ?"
I will do my best .
Emma sat with her as long as she could , to attend her in Mrs . Goddard ' s unavoidable absences , and raise her spirits by representing how much Mr . Elton ' s would be depressed when he knew her state ; and left her at last tolerably comfortable , in the sweet dependence of his having a most comfortless visit , and of their all missing her very much .
In this walk Emma and Mr . Weston found all the others assembled ; and towards this view she immediately perceived Mr . Knightley and Harriet distinct from the rest , quietly leading the way .
She cast her eye over it , pondered , caught the meaning , read it through again to be quite certain , and quite mistress of the lines , and then passing it to Harriet , sat happily smiling , and saying to herself , while Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope and dulness , " Very well , Mr . Elton , very well indeed .
Such might be his constitution ; and as she knew that eating and drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints , she recommended his taking some refreshment ; he would find abundance of every thing in the dining - room -- and she humanely pointed out the door .
It struck her with dreadful force , and she was ready to give it every bad name in the world .
Her tears fell abundantly -- but her grief was so truly artless , that no dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma ' s eyes -- and she listened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and understanding -- really for the time convinced that Harriet was the superior creature of the two -- and that to resemble her would be more for her own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could do .
no , I am sure you are a great deal too kind to -- but if you would just advise me what I had best do -- No , no , I do not mean that -- As you say , one ' s mind ought to be quite made up -- One should not be hesitating -- It is a very serious thing .-- It will be safer to say ` No ,' perhaps .-- Do you think I had better say ` No ?'"
Mr . Martin looked as if he did not know what manner was .
And , by the bye , can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion ?-- Pray be sincere , Knightley .
I treat you without ceremony , Mr . Knightley .
Harriet did not consider herself as having any thing to complain of .
Can I do any thing for you ?"
convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about Hartfield .
But I am quite in the minority , I believe ; few people seem to value simplicity of dress ,-- show and finery are every thing .
It must have been from attachment only , that she could be led to form the engagement .
" By all means .
Sixteen miles -- nay , eighteen -- it must be full eighteen to Manchester - street -- was a serious obstacle .
" Almost every moment .
" What is to be done , my dear Emma ?-- what is to be done ?"
" What did Mr . Weston tell you ?"
She was the instigator .
She might never have thought of him but for me ; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope , if I had not assured her of his attachment , for she is as modest and humble as I used to think him .
" I am sure you were of use to me ," cried Emma .
said he , offering his hand .
I wanted to know a little more , and this tells me quite enough .
