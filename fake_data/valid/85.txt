He did consent .
" Harriet , poor Harriet !"
Well , Frank , your dream certainly shews that Highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent .
One is sick of the very name of Jane Fairfax .
Mr . Knightley , why do not you stay at home like poor Mr .
she was going to exclaim ; but she presently found that it was a family of old friends , who were coming , like herself , by particular desire , to help Mr . Weston ' s judgment ; and they were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins , who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness , on the same errand , that it seemed as if half the company might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection .
Mrs . Elton was first seen at church : but though devotion might be interrupted , curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew , and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid , to settle whether she were very pretty indeed , or only rather pretty , or not pretty at all .
Plain dealing was always best .
It is just what I used to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship , when , because things did not go quite right , did not proceed with all the rapidity which suited his feelings , he was apt to be in despair , and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be _May_ before Hymen ' s saffron robe would be put on for us .
" Very well ; and if he had intended to give her one , he would have told her so ."
If they must dance , they had better dance at Randalls .
A crowd in a little room -- Miss Woodhouse , you have the art of giving pictures in a few words .
While he talked to Isabella , however , Emma found an opportunity of saying ,
A carriage was heard .
Let us wait , therefore , for this letter .
It was a clear thing he was less in love than he had been .
" You will soon be cooler , if you sit still ," said Emma .
Without scruple -- without apology -- without much apparent diffidence , Mr . Elton , the lover of Harriet , was professing himself _her_ lover .
What say you both to our collecting the same party , and exploring to Box Hill again , while the fine weather lasts ?-- It must be the same party , you know , quite the same party , not _one_ exception ."
" You do quite right ," said she ;--" we will make your apologies to Mr . and Mrs .
VOLUME III
You will laugh at my warmth -- but , upon my word , I talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax .-- And her situation is so calculated to affect one !-- Miss Woodhouse , we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her .
I know it has .
" On the misery of what she had suffered , during the concealment of so many months ," continued Mrs . Weston , " she was energetic .
Surry is the garden of England ."
The most satisfactory comparisons were rising in her mind .
" Impossible !-- I never can call you any thing but ` Mr .
And she , " Only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment , but she did think there were some looks a little like Mr .
But I do not understand how the room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father ' s house ."
These were claims which he did not learn to overlook , though some years passed away from the death of poor Fairfax , before his own return to England put any thing in his power .
You are the worst judge in the world , Mr . Knightley , of the difficulties of dependence .
Have you finished it ?
But on seeing them together , she became perfectly satisfied .
Pray do not let them talk of it .
It was by no means his daughter ' s wish that the intellects of Highbury in general should be put under requisition .
He was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal , and came back all the better -- grown quite cool -- and , with good manners , like himself -- able to draw a chair close to them , take an interest in their employment ; and regret , in a reasonable way , that he should be so late .
Emma pondered a moment , and then replied , " I will not pretend _not_ to understand you ; and to give you all the relief in my power , be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me , as you are apprehensive of ."
Their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening acquaintance .
I know you will soon call on her ; she is living in dread of the visit .
When we talked about him , it was as clear as possible ."
It was a great consolation that Mr . Elton should not be really in love with her , or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint him -- that Harriet ' s nature should not be of that superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive -- and that there could be no necessity for any body ' s knowing what had passed except the three principals , and especially for her father ' s being given a moment ' s uneasiness about it .
" I have no doubt of their being happy together ," said Emma ; " I believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached ."
She laughed because she was disappointed ; and though she liked him for his attentions , and thought them all , whether in friendship , admiration , or playfulness , extremely judicious , they were not winning back her heart .
" I am afraid ," said he , composing his features , " I am very much afraid , my dear Emma , that you will not smile when you hear it ."
" Pretty !
I have no reason to think ill of her -- not the least -- except that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner , such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body , is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal ."
Instances have been known of young people passing many , many months successively , without being at any ball of any description , and no material injury accrue either to body or mind ;-- but when a beginning is made -- when the felicities of rapid motion have once been , though slightly , felt -- it must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more .
Selina has entirely given up music -- never touches the instrument -- though she played sweetly .
" I agree with you exactly .
It is always the lady ' s right to decide on the degree of acquaintance .
It did not accord with the rationality of plan , the moderation in expense , or even the unselfish warmth of heart , which she had believed herself to discern in him yesterday .
Elton .-- She looked round for a moment ; he had joined Mr . Knightley at a little distance , and was arranging himself for settled conversation , while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife .
" Quite seasonable ; and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin yesterday , and prevent this day ' s party , which it might very possibly have done , for Mr . Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been much snow on the ground ; but now it is of no consequence .
It was hardly right ; but it had been so strong an idea , that it would escape her , and his submission to all that she told , was a compliment to her penetration , which made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue .
He shook his head with a smile , and looked as if he had very little doubt and very little mercy .
sir -- but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a window - curtain , and throw up a sash , without its being suspected .
It will be bad enough for the horses ."
" She always declares she will never marry , which , of course , means just nothing at all .
The young man ' s conduct , and his sister ' s , seemed the result of real feeling , and she could not but pity them .
He contrived that she should be seated by him ; and was sufficiently employed in looking out the best baked apple for her , and trying to make her help or advise him in his work , till Jane Fairfax was quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again .
The only way of proving it , however , will be to turn to our maps .
You see we have been wedging one leg with paper .
Mr . Knightley connected it with the dream ; but how it could all be , was beyond his comprehension .
She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt , very worthy people ; I have known them all my life .
That , from such a quarter , one might expect .
James could take the note .
The consciousness of having done amiss , had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes , and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been -- that had been -- hard for him to bear .
He was a nervous man , easily depressed ; fond of every body that he was used to , and hating to part with them ; hating change of every kind .
But I shall always think it a very abominable sort of proceeding .
And , my dear , whenever he comes , you had better let him look at little Bella ' s throat ."
You would not think it to look at him , but he is bilious -- Mr . Cole is very bilious .
A _Mrs . _ _Elton_ would be an excuse for any change of intercourse ; former intimacy might sink without remark .
cried he , looking eagerly at her , " are you , indeed ?"
And Mrs .
You will have my sketches , some time or other , to look at -- or my tour to read -- or my poem .
You would not wish to disappoint and mortify the Coles , I am sure , sir ; friendly , good sort of people as ever lived , and who have been your neighbours these _ten_ years ."
I must buy something at Ford ' s .
returned Mr . Knightley , with energy .
I am sorry for it .
She then began to speak of you , and of the great kindness you had shewn her during her illness ; and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected , desired me , whenever I had an opportunity , to thank you -- I could not thank you too much -- for every wish and every endeavour to do her good .
" I believe it is very true , my dear , indeed ," said Mr . Woodhouse , with a sigh .
It was his idea to bring her to Hartfield : he had thought of no other place .
continued Mrs . Elton ; " Knightley himself !-- Was not it lucky ?-- for , not being within when he called the other day , I had never seen him before ; and of course , as so particular a friend of Mr . E .' s , I had a great curiosity .
" I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple ."
Let them be sent to Donwell .
and she had difficulty in behaving with temper .
Does Mrs . Churchill do the same ?"
And he was really a very pleasing young man , a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like .
Harriet bore the intelligence very well -- blaming nobody -- and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion of herself , as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to her friend .
I assure you I have .
She had been thinking of him the moment before , as unquestionably sixteen miles distant .-- There was time only for the quickest arrangement of mind .
Mr . Weston ' s dining - room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably ; and for my part , I would rather , under such circumstances , fall short by two than exceed by two .
" I can answer for every thing of that nature , sir , because it will be under Mrs . Weston ' s care .
Her sensibilities , I suspect , are strong -- and her temper excellent in its power of forbearance , patience , self - controul ; but it wants openness .
I could not bear to have Henry supplanted .-- Mr . Knightley marry !-- No , I have never had such an idea , and I cannot adopt it now .
I cannot help suspecting him .
" Not Harriet ' s equal !"
She felt for Harriet , with pain and with contrition ; but no flight of generosity run mad , opposing all that could be probable or reasonable , entered her brain .
I think it would be much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer , and take their tea with us -- take us in their afternoon walk ; which they might do , as our hours are so reasonable , and yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening .
-- Highbury , with Mrs . Weston , stood for Hartfield ; and she trusted to its bearing the same construction with him .
