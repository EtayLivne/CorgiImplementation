I am sure , a month ago , I had no more idea myself !-- The strangest things do take place !"
Mrs . Perry was always particularly fond of my mother -- indeed I do not know who is not -- and she had mentioned it to her in confidence ; she had no objection to her telling us , of course , but it was not to go beyond : and , from that day to this , I never mentioned it to a soul that I know of .
A very few to - morrows stood between the young people of Highbury and happiness .
How else could they come ?"
Heavens !
How did you all behave ?
They shew her to the greatest advantage .
I will invite your guests ."
He knew of no one but Mrs . Goddard to whom he could apply for information of her relations or friends .
Had the same behaviour continued , Miss Smith might have been led into a misconception of your views ; not being aware , probably , any more than myself , of the very great inequality which you are so sensible of .
The happiness of Miss Smith was quite equal to her intentions .
Very sincerely did Emma wish to do so ; but it was not immediately in her power .
said she : " did you ever sit for your picture ?"
It would be a _secret_ satisfaction ; but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she should attend to any thing Jane might communicate .
" And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her !
Her father ' s business was to announce James ' s being gone out to put the horses to , preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls ; and she had , therefore , an immediate excuse for disappearing .
Ah !
But she is really quite the gentlewoman ."
You forget how time passes ."
I hope , with all my heart , the young man may be a Weston in merit , and a Churchill in fortune .-- But Harriet Smith -- I have not half done about Harriet Smith .
I cannot let you continue in your error ; and yet , perhaps , since my manners gave such an impression , I have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have been at all attached to the person we are speaking of , as it might be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse .-- But I never have ."
She introduced him to her friend , Miss Smith , and , at convenient moments afterwards , heard what each thought of the other .
He knows I have a thorough regard for him and all his family , and , I believe , considers me as one of his best friends .
the proper sport of boys and girls , but a single woman , of good fortune , is always respectable , and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else .
At this moment , an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma ' s brain with regard to Jane Fairfax , this charming Mr . Dixon , and the not going to Ireland , she said , with the insidious design of farther discovery ,
Henceforward I know nothing of the matter .
impossible !"
Very pleasant party .
I could not help being provoked ; for after all my pains , and when I had really made a very good likeness of it --( Mrs . Weston and I were quite agreed in thinking it _very_ like )-- only too handsome -- too flattering -- but that was a fault on the right side -- after all this , came poor dear Isabella ' s cold approbation of --" Yes , it was a little like -- but to be sure it did not do him justice ."
There are secrets in all families , you know )-- The case is , that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in January ; and that Frank ' s coming depends upon their being put off .
Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech , and saw no alarming symptoms of love .
But colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn .
Her spirits seemed overcome .
Dixon ?"
" No , my dear ," said her father instantly ; " _that_ I am sure you are not .
She still intended him for her friend .
can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his affections from Harriet to me ?-- Absurd and insufferable !"
" It was an awkward business , my dear , your spending the autumn at South End instead of coming here .
" I do not know , my dear .
Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business to be going forward just at this time ?-- Do you imagine it to be the consequence of an immediate commission from him , or that he may have sent only a general direction , an order indefinite as to time , to depend upon contingencies and conveniences ?"
I do not wonder at you .
" I do not know which it ought to be called ."
returned Mr . Knightley , with energy .
Mr . Woodhouse at last was off ; but Mr . Knightley , instead of being immediately off likewise , sat down again , seemingly inclined for more chat .
.
" The shame ," he answered , " is all mine , or ought to be .
For half an hour Mr . Weston was surprized and sorry ; but then he began to perceive that Frank ' s coming two or three months later would be a much better plan ; better time of year ; better weather ; and that he would be able , without any doubt , to stay considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner .
The horror of being blocked up at Randalls , while her children were at Hartfield , was full in her imagination ; and fancying the road to be now just passable for adventurous people , but in a state that admitted no delay , she was eager to have it settled , that her father and Emma should remain at Randalls , while she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them .
" Oh !
After Emma had talked about it for ten minutes , Mr . Woodhouse felt no unwillingness , and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself , with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him .
" I promise you to make none for myself , papa ; but I must , indeed , for other people .
" Oh !
Not to wait upon a bride is very remiss .
Do not you remember what Mr . Perry said , so many years ago , when I had the measles ?
" You are sick of prosperity and indulgence .
He is just as superior as ever ;-- but being married , you know , it is quite a different thing .
I am quite ready .
I do not want the match -- I do not want to injure dear little Henry -- but the idea has been given me by circumstances ; and if Mr . Knightley really wished to marry , you would not have him refrain on Henry ' s account , a boy of six years old , who knows nothing of the matter ?"
Late hours do not agree with us .
The charming Augusta Hawkins , in addition to all the usual advantages of perfect beauty and merit , was in possession of an independent fortune , of so many thousands as would always be called ten ; a point of some dignity , as well as some convenience : the story told well ; he had not thrown himself away -- he had gained a woman of 10 , 000 l . or thereabouts ; and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity -- the first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by distinguishing notice ; the history which he had to give Mrs . Cole of the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious -- the steps so quick , from the accidental rencontre , to the dinner at Mr . Green ' s , and the party at Mrs . Brown ' s -- smiles and blushes rising in importance -- with consciousness and agitation richly scattered -- the lady had been so easily impressed -- so sweetly disposed -- had in short , to use a most intelligible phrase , been so very ready to have him , that vanity and prudence were equally contented .
She was warmly gratified -- and in another moment still more so , by a little movement of more than common friendliness on his part .-- He took her hand ;-- whether she had not herself made the first motion , she could not say -- she might , perhaps , have rather offered it -- but he took her hand , pressed it , and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips -- when , from some fancy or other , he suddenly let it go .-- Why he should feel such a scruple , why he should change his mind when it was all but done , she could not perceive .-- He would have judged better , she thought , if he had not stopped .-- The intention , however , was indubitable ; and whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry , or however else it happened , but she thought nothing became him more .-- It was with him , of so simple , yet so dignified a nature .-- She could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction .
" No , my dear ," said her father instantly ; " _that_ I am sure you are not .
She had hoped for an answer here -- for a few words to say that her conduct was at least intelligible ; but he was silent ; and , as far as she could judge , deep in thought .
I hope , with all my heart , the young man may be a Weston in merit , and a Churchill in fortune .-- But Harriet Smith -- I have not half done about Harriet Smith .
He had walked up one day after dinner , as he very often did , to spend his evening at Hartfield .
After a mutual silence of some minutes , Harriet thus began again --
In this age of literature , such collections on a very grand scale are not uncommon .
Mr . Elton ' s superiority had very ample acknowledgment .
" There is my news :-- I thought it would interest you ," said Mr . Knightley , with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of what had passed between them .
Miss Woodhouse , what can we do about that ?"
She was a plain , motherly kind of woman , who had worked hard in her youth , and now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a tea - visit ; and having formerly owed much to Mr . Woodhouse ' s kindness , felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat parlour , hung round with fancy - work , whenever she could , and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside .
Richard ?-- Oh !
I can see nothing at all extraordinary in him now .-- I do not care whether I meet him or not -- except that of the two I had rather not see him -- and indeed I would go any distance round to avoid him -- but I do not envy his wife in the least ; I neither admire her nor envy her , as I have done : she is very charming , I dare say , and all that , but I think her very ill - tempered and disagreeable -- I shall never forget her look the other night !-- However , I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , I wish her no evil .-- No , let them be ever so happy together , it will not give me another moment ' s pang : and to convince you that I have been speaking truth , I am now going to destroy -- what I ought to have destroyed long ago -- what I ought never to have kept -- I know that very well ( blushing as she spoke ).-- However , now I will destroy it all -- and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence , that you may see how rational I am grown .
there is one difficulty unprovided for ," cried Emma .
It was very wrong of me , you know , to keep any remembrances , after he was married .
He agreed to it , but with so quiet a " Yes ," as inclined her almost to doubt his real concurrence ; and yet there must be a very distinct sort of elegance for the fashionable world , if Jane Fairfax could be thought only ordinarily gifted with it .
I say , sir ," turning to Mr . Woodhouse , " I think there are few places with such society as Highbury .
The Churchills might not have a word to say in return ; but then , you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through .
" Depend upon it , Emma , a sensible man would find no difficulty in it .
Mr . Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea , and was repeating , " No husbands and wives in the case at present indeed , as you observe .
such delicacy !-- and yet without being actually fair .-- One cannot call her fair .
" He is very young to settle ," was Mr . Woodhouse ' s observation .
What am I to do ?"
Here , she must be leading a life of privation and penance ; there it would have been all enjoyment .
She had no doubt as to his being less in love -- but neither his agitated spirits , nor his hurrying away , seemed like a perfect cure ; and she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her returning power , and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself with her long .
Emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important service which his better sense would have rendered her , to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly follies -- her wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith ; but it was too tender a subject .-- She could not enter on it .-- Harriet was very seldom mentioned between them .
continued Harriet --" these two last !-- But how shall I ever be able to return the paper , or say I have found it out ?-- Oh !
" Very pretty , sir , upon my word ; to send me on here , to be an encumbrance to my friends , so long before you vouchsafe to come !-- But you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with .
Instead of drawing his brother off to a window while they waited for dinner , he was talking to Miss Fairfax .
" Depend upon me -- but ask no more questions .
I will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs . Elton , by calling you Mr . K .-- But I will promise ," she added presently , laughing and blushing --" I will promise to call you once by your Christian name .
" There is so pointed , and so particular a meaning in this compliment ," said she , " that I cannot have a doubt as to Mr . Elton ' s intentions .
Her situation should secure your compassion .
I thought him very plain at first , but I do not think him so plain now .
They will be extremely glad to see you , I am sure ; and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way ."
It will be felt so great an attention !
What is right to be done cannot be done too soon .
" There is so pointed , and so particular a meaning in this compliment ," said she , " that I cannot have a doubt as to Mr . Elton ' s intentions .
CHAPTER XVIII
" I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs . Weston .
