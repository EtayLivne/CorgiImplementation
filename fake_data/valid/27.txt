You may be very sure I shall always take care of _them_ ."
you are too scrupulous , indeed you are ," cried Emma warmly , and taking her hand .
poor Harriet !"
Kitty , a fair but frozen maid , Kindled a flame I yet deplore , The hood - wink ' d boy I called to aid , Though of his near approach afraid , So fatal to my suit before .
We were very wrong before ; we will be cautious now .-- He is your superior , no doubt , and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature ; but yet , Harriet , more wonderful things have taken place , there have been matches of greater disparity .
Frank Churchill ' s little inclination to exclude himself increased so much , that his last words to Emma were ,
Jane speaks so distinct !
Excepting inequality of fortune , and perhaps a little disparity of age , I can see nothing unsuitable ."
Trust to me ."
" Something has happened to delay her ; some visitors perhaps ."
There was no want of likeness , she had been fortunate in the attitude , and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure , to give a little more height , and considerably more elegance , she had great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last , and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both -- a standing memorial of the beauty of one , the skill of the other , and the friendship of both ; with as many other agreeable associations as Mr . Elton ' s very promising attachment was likely to add .
Dixon ?"
Delighted to hear it indeed .
This was very proper ; the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable ; but it should have lasted longer .
Jane will be only four miles from Maple Grove ."
It is fit that the fortune should be on his side , for I think the merit will be all on hers ."
" I had a few lines on parish business from Mr . Weston this morning , and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened ."
Its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each other !
" Will you be so kind ," said she , " when I am missed , as to say that I am gone home ?-- I am going this moment .-- My aunt is not aware how late it is , nor how long we have been absent -- but I am sure we shall be wanted , and I am determined to go directly .-- I have said nothing about it to any body .
The only thing I do not thoroughly like is , that she seems to be sitting out of doors , with only a little shawl over her shoulders -- and it makes one think she must catch cold ."
One perplexity , however , arose , which the gentlemen did not disdain .
Why should there be any change ?"
it gives one exactly the idea of such a height as Miss Smith ' s .
The hair was curled , and the maid sent away , and Emma sat down to think and be miserable .-- It was a wretched business indeed !-- Such an overthrow of every thing she had been wishing for !-- Such a development of every thing most unwelcome !-- Such a blow for Harriet !-- that was the worst of all .
You and I , Emma , will venture to take the part of the poor husband .
yes , quite indispensable ."
CHAPTER IV
" I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy ," said Mr . Knightley presently , " though I have kept my thoughts to myself ; but I now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet .
" Oh !
( with some elevation ) I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance -- of Mr . Knightley ' s coming and asking me to dance , when Mr . Elton would not stand up with me ; and when there was no other partner in the room .
Her way was clear , though not quite smooth .-- She spoke then , on being so entreated .-- What did she say ?-- Just what she ought , of course .
Knightley .--" Emma , that I fear is a word -- No , I have no wish -- Stay , yes , why should I hesitate ?-- I have gone too far already for concealment .-- Emma , I accept your offer -- Extraordinary as it may seem , I accept it , and refer myself to you as a friend .-- Tell me , then , have I no chance of ever succeeding ?"
She was as happy as possible with the Martins in the summer .
I think it admirable ; and , as far as I can answer for myself , shall be most happy -- It seems the only improvement that could be .
He stays till to - morrow , and Miss Fairfax has been persuaded to spend the day with us .-- They are coming in , I hope ."
dear , yes ," before the gentleman joined them .
But " she could never get acquainted with her : she did not know how it was , but there was such coldness and reserve -- such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not -- and then , her aunt was such an eternal talker !-- and she was made such a fuss with by every body !-- and it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate -- because their ages were the same , every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other ."
" Knightley !"
It is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally beloved -- which gives Isabella all her popularity .-- I have it not -- but I know how to prize and respect it .-- Harriet is my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives .
A few minutes more , and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own house , to get sober and cool , and the other recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over .
Emma would not agree to this , and began a warm defence of Miss Fairfax ' s complexion .
" The carriage !
said Emma .
Here ,-- probably this basket with pink ribbon .
" Proof indeed !"
By a most fortunate chance his leaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance at this critical moment .
She was quite one of her worthies -- the most amiable , affable , delightful woman -- just as accomplished and condescending as Mrs . Elton meant to be considered .
But how shall I do ?
A great deal of very reasonable , very just displeasure I had to persuade away .
cried Mr . Knightley .
While they are with us , we shall explore a great deal , I dare say .
And how tired you must be after your journey !
-- ` I can see nobody ,' said she ; and up she got , and would go away ; and that was what made us keep you waiting -- and extremely sorry and ashamed we were .
" Yes --( rather hesitatingly )-- I believe I do ."
.
And then whispering -- " Our companions are excessively stupid .
Actually to discover that Mr . Knightley is a gentleman !
-- which my mother , being on the watch , heard distinctly , and was sadly alarmed at .
And there would be poor Emma in the carriage behind .
A Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on that passage ."
She is known only as parlour - boarder at a common school .
Mrs . Weston undertakes to direct the whole ."
He had gone away rejected and mortified -- disappointed in a very sanguine hope , after a series of what appeared to him strong encouragement ; and not only losing the right lady , but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one .
You may be very sure I shall always take care of _them_ ."
I never heard any county but Surry called so ."
Mr . Knightley grew angry .
If one thinks of all that it has to do , and all that it does so well , it is really astonishing !"
He is half way to Windsor by this time ."
It has hurt his father equally .
" You surprize me !
He saw his son every year in London , and was proud of him ; and his fond report of him as a very fine young man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too .
I will answer for it _she_ never betrayed the least thing in the world .
I come in for a pretty good share as a second .
Another view of man , my second brings ; Behold him there , the monarch of the seas !
CHAPTER VI
It was some days before she saw Jane Fairfax , to judge of her honest regret in this woeful change ; but when they did meet , her composure was odious .
We are so very airy !
They called for him in their way ; were all extremely amused ; and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day -- which he did -- and in the course of that visit ( as I understand ) he found an opportunity of speaking to Harriet ; and certainly did not speak in vain .-- She made him , by her acceptance , as happy even as he is deserving .
Harriet was remembered only from being _her_ friend .
" I was only going to observe , that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women , I cannot imagine them to be very frequent .
I never heard of such a thing .
I thought you had lost half your property , at least .
" Happy couple !"
According to Miss Bates -- it all came from her -- Mrs . Dixon had written most pressingly .
" I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome ."
It would be a great disappointment to Mr . John Knightley ; consequently to Isabella .
" Ah !
At last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown ; and being now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged , Emma recollected his intended visit the day before , and asked him if he had paid it .
Yes , Friday or Saturday ; she cannot say which , because Colonel Campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days .
" But still , you will be an old maid !
Sometimes Mr . Elton predominated , sometimes the Martins ; and each was occasionally useful as a check to the other .
William Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year .
It is my party .
We copied it from the Elegant Extracts .
" Oh !
He could not understand it ; but there were symptoms of intelligence between them -- he thought so at least -- symptoms of admiration on his side , which , having once observed , he could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning , however he might wish to escape any of Emma ' s errors of imagination .
" While her dear father lived , any change of condition must be impossible for her .
my dear , but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any good ; and as to myself , I have been long perfectly convinced , though perhaps I never told you so before , that the sea is very rarely of use to any body .
A very gracious invitation was returned , and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion .
WINDSOR - JULY .
