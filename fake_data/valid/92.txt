" Aye , very true .
Miss Nash had told her all this , and had talked a great deal more about Mr . Elton ; and said , looking so very significantly at her , " that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be , but she only knew that any woman whom Mr . Elton could prefer , she should think the luckiest woman in the world ; for , beyond a doubt , Mr . Elton had not his equal for beauty or agreeableness ."
I can imagine , that if you , as you are , Mr . Knightley , were to be transported and placed all at once in Mr . Frank Churchill ' s situation , you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him ; and it might have a very good effect .
it shews what a sad invalid I am !
To be constantly living with an ill - tempered person , must be dreadful .
How do you do , Miss Smith ?-- Very well I thank you .-- And I begged Mrs . Weston to come with me , that I might be sure of succeeding ."
Yes , I immediately perceive that it must be the joint present of Mr . and Mrs . Dixon .
" The old lady !
Mrs . Dixon , I understand , has no remarkable degree of personal beauty ; is not , by any means , to be compared with Miss Fairfax ."
" That you do not give another half - second to the subject .
said she .--" To chuse to remain here month after month , under privations of every sort !
my dear , as Perry says , where health is at stake , nothing else should be considered ; and if one is to travel , there is not much to chuse between forty miles and an hundred .-- Better not move at all , better stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get into a worse air .
There must be ample room in it for every real comfort .
If I could but have kept longer away !"
It is impossible to refuse what you ask in such a way .
Mrs . Elton ' s resources were inadequate to such an attack .
Emma understood him ; and as soon as she could recover from the flutter of pleasure , excited by such tender consideration , replied ,
I must get rid of every thing .-- There it goes , and there is an end , thank Heaven !
A lady always does .-- She said enough to shew there need not be despair -- and to invite him to say more himself .
said Mrs . John Knightley .-- " It is so long since I have seen her , except now and then for a moment accidentally in town !
I think their father is too rough with them very often ."
Mrs . Weston informed her that she was going to call on the Bateses , in order to hear the new instrument .
cried he .
Oh !
" And now that I understand your question , I must pronounce it to be a very unfair one .
Emma ' s sense of right however had decided it ; and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother , she had particular pleasure , from the circumstance of the late disagreement between Mr . Knightley and herself , in procuring him the proper invitation .
But the question is not , whether it would be a bad connexion for him , but whether he wishes it ; and I think he does .
" She meant to be impertinently curious , just as such an Anne Cox should be ."
Within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge - ware box , which Harriet opened : it was well lined with the softest cotton ; but , excepting the cotton , Emma saw only a small piece of court - plaister .
I must confess it is a recommendation to me .
Something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way through a storm of snow ."
Will not the old prejudice be too strong ?"
However , _I_ shall always think it a very pleasant party , and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it ."
` My dear ,' said I , ` I shall say you are laid down upon the bed :' but , however , she is not ; she is walking about the room .
" I think her beautiful , quite beautiful ."
_There_ , indeed , lay real pleasure , for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty - four to his comfort ; and feeling that , unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and confiding esteem , she could not , in her general conduct , be open to any severe reproach .
" We want only two more to be just the right number .
He had never been an unhappy man ; his own temper had secured him from that , even in his first marriage ; but his second must shew him how delightful a well - judging and truly amiable woman could be , and must give him the pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen , to excite gratitude than to feel it .
It ought to have been a habit with him by this time , of following his duty , instead of consulting expediency .
I hoped I was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description .
And Mr . Dixon seems a very charming young man , quite worthy of him .
The kind - hearted , polite old man might then sit down and feel that he had done his duty , and made every fair lady welcome and easy .
" He came to their father upon some business , and he asked him to stay to dinner ."
She had never rejoiced at the sound before , nor ever before entered the passage , nor walked up the stairs , with any wish of giving pleasure , but in conferring obligation , or of deriving it , except in subsequent ridicule .
Emma was in no danger of forgetting .
Short letters from Frank were received at Randalls , communicating all that was immediately important of their state and plans .
She was in dancing , singing , exclaiming spirits ; and till she had moved about , and talked to herself , and laughed and reflected , she could be fit for nothing rational .
And , my dear , whenever he comes , you had better let him look at little Bella ' s throat ."
Dear Mrs . Weston !
Jane she had a distinct glimpse of , looking extremely ill ; and , before the door had shut them out , she heard Miss Bates saying , " Well , my dear , I shall _say_ you are laid down upon the bed , and I am sure you are ill enough ."
very well ," exclaimed Miss Bates , " then I need not be uneasy .
Emma was extremely glad to see him -- but there was a degree of confusion -- a number of embarrassing recollections on each side .
" Happy couple !"
She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate , indulgent father ; and had , in consequence of her sister ' s marriage , been mistress of his house from a very early period .
yes , quite indispensable ."
You must have done well .
And as it is some months since Miss Campbell married , the impression may be a little worn off ."
Her own conduct , as well as her own heart , was before her in the same few minutes .
" I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him ."
In short , I can feel no dependence on his coming , and I wish Mr . Weston were less sanguine ."
Don ' t scruple .
It was not lost on me .
She was so eager to have them drawn that I could not refuse ; but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know ; nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them , beyond the air and complexion , unless they are coarser featured than any of mama ' s children ever were .
He went to town on business three days ago , and I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting to send to John .-- He delivered these papers to John , at his chambers , and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley ' s .
What has it been but a system of hypocrisy and deceit ,-- espionage , and treachery ?-- To come among us with professions of openness and simplicity ; and such a league in secret to judge us all !-- Here have we been , the whole winter and spring , completely duped , fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and honour , with two people in the midst of us who may have been carrying round , comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both to hear .-- They must take the consequence , if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable !"
I wonder who the friend was -- and who could be the young lady .
When she took in her history , indeed , her situation , as well as her beauty ; when she considered what all this elegance was destined to , what she was going to sink from , how she was going to live , it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect ; especially , if to every well - known particular entitling her to interest , were added the highly probable circumstance of an attachment to Mr . Dixon , which she had so naturally started to herself .
no -- I am grieved to find -- I was on the point of telling you that when I called at Mrs . Goddard ' s door , which I did the very last thing before I returned to dress , I was told that Miss Smith was not better , by no means better , rather worse .
Weston .]
The misfortune of Harriet ' s cold had been pretty well gone through before her arrival .
Mr . Cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago ."
He has a wife and family to maintain , and is not to be giving away his time .
Now Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte ; and the remembrance of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing , that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough ; and , with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to say of the good wishes which she really felt , took leave .
Let every body on the Hill hear me if they can .
He has no occasion to marry , either to fill up his time or his heart ."
Any other situation would have been much less in character .
It depends entirely upon his aunt ' s spirits and pleasure ; in short , upon her temper .
While he spoke , Emma ' s mind was most busy , and , with all the wonderful velocity of thought , had been able -- and yet without losing a word -- to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole ; to see that Harriet ' s hopes had been entirely groundless , a mistake , a delusion , as complete a delusion as any of her own -- that Harriet was nothing ; that she was every thing herself ; that what she had been saying relative to Harriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings ; and that her agitation , her doubts , her reluctance , her discouragement , had been all received as discouragement from herself .-- And not only was there time for these convictions , with all their glow of attendant happiness ; there was time also to rejoice that Harriet ' s secret had not escaped her , and to resolve that it need not , and should not .-- It was all the service she could now render her poor friend ; for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection from herself to Harriet , as infinitely the most worthy of the two -- or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever , without vouchsafing any motive , because he could not marry them both , Emma had it not .
Or , perhaps she may not have resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life .
Had he said any thing to bear a different construction , I should not have believed him ."
Tell your aunt , little Emma , that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old grievances , and that if she were not wrong before , she is now ."
said Mr . Woodhouse , always the last to make his way in conversation ; " then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady .
The danger would have been of my wearying you .
Frank ' s was the first idea ; and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it ; for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties , and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance .
Mr . Knightley promises to give up his claim this Christmas -- though you know it is longer since they were with him , than with us ."
Emma recollected , blushed , was sorry , but tried to laugh it off .
Some portion of respect for herself , however , in spite of all these demerits -- some concern for her own appearance , and a strong sense of justice by Harriet --( there would be no need of _compassion_ to the girl who believed herself loved by Mr . Knightley -- but justice required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now ,) gave Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness , with even apparent kindness .-- For her own advantage indeed , it was fit that the utmost extent of Harriet ' s hopes should be enquired into ; and Harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained -- or to deserve to be slighted by the person , whose counsels had never led her right .-- Rousing from reflection , therefore , and subduing her emotion , she turned to Harriet again , and , in a more inviting accent , renewed the conversation ; for as to the subject which had first introduced it , the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax , that was quite sunk and lost .-- Neither of them thought but of Mr . Knightley and themselves .
Mrs . Hodges may well be angry .
But take it away , and all _appropriation_ ceases , and a very pretty gallant charade remains , fit for any collection .
It would be the greatest pleasure to them , if you could allow me to attend you there .
The want of proper families in the place , and the conviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted to attend , were mentioned ; but he was not satisfied .
Only three of us .-- besides dear Jane at present -- and she really eats nothing -- makes such a shocking breakfast , you would be quite frightened if you saw it .
she was going to exclaim ; but she presently found that it was a family of old friends , who were coming , like herself , by particular desire , to help Mr . Weston ' s judgment ; and they were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins , who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness , on the same errand , that it seemed as if half the company might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection .
Come , sir , pray let me hear it ."
" Dear me !-- How should I ever have borne it !
no , now I recollect , now I have it ; something happened before tea , but not that .
She says she is afraid there will be draughts in the passage , though every thing has been done -- One door nailed up -- Quantities of matting -- My dear Jane , indeed you must .
In a moment he went on --
It was to be a whole - length in water - colours , like Mr . John Knightley ' s , and was destined , if she could please herself , to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece .
