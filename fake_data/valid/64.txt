It was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage .
We will go to Hartfield afterwards .
Emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone to bed , more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her , and to depend on getting tolerably out of it .
My dear Mrs . Weston , do not take to match - making .
Thy ready wit the word will soon supply , May its approval beam in that soft eye !
" Charming Miss Woodhouse !
Alas !
Miss Smith , pray take care .
And as to conceit , he is the farthest from it of any man I know .
" But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so soon , though he does .
" I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature , in suspecting that he may have learnt to be above his connexions , and to care very little for any thing but his own pleasure , from living with those who have always set him the example of it .
From perfect misery to perfect happiness !"
but I never have been in love ; it is not my way , or my nature ; and I do not think I ever shall .
He came to the part of the room where the sitters - by were collected , spoke to some , and walked about in front of them , as if to shew his liberty , and his resolution of maintaining it .
It is Mrs . Dixon , I dare say .
But how sad it is that he should not live at home with his father !
She then took a longer time for consideration .
Mr . Churchill had made a point of it , as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost ; and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum ."
Emma felt they were friends again ; and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction , and then a little sauciness , she could not help saying , as he was admiring the baby ,
" What is it my dear friend ?
said she .-- " The regularity and despatch of it !
But after all the punishment that misconduct can bring , it is still not less misconduct .
' Tis a sad business ."
cried Emma , turning her glowing cheeks towards him ; for , while she spoke , it occurred to her that he might have called at Mrs . Goddard ' s in his way .
Human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting situations , that a young person , who either marries or dies , is sure of being kindly spoken of .
Better be without sense , than misapply it as you do ."
But soon it came to be on one side ,
It is only by seeing women in their own homes , among their own set , just as they always are , that you can form any just judgment .
Wax - candles in the schoolroom !
thought Emma .
Good Heavens !-- What can be to be _broke_ to me , that does not relate to one of that family ?"
In the meanwhile , she resolved against seeing Harriet .-- It would do neither of them good , it would do the subject no good , to be talking of it farther .-- She was resolved not to be convinced , as long as she could doubt , and yet had no authority for opposing Harriet ' s confidence .
Her mutterings were chiefly to her husband ; and he murmured , in reply ,
While they are with us , we shall explore a great deal , I dare say .
" Just as they always do -- very vulgar ."
" Yes : but a young lady -- a bride -- I ought to have paid my respects to her if possible .
It might be safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity and beauty , its rich pastures , spreading flocks , orchard in blossom , and light column of smoke ascending .-- She joined them at the wall , and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around .
Mrs . Elton , very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her by such a hope , smiled most graciously .
CHAPTER VII
Churchill ?"
" Then , my dear Isabella , it is the most extraordinary sort of thing in the world , for in general every thing does give you cold .
Well , I shall bring Jane with me -- Jane and her aunt .-- The rest I leave to you .
I do not know who would ever look at him in the company of the other .
At first it was downright dulness to Emma .
As to her illness , all nothing of course .
Exactly so .
" I do not say it is so ; but you will do well to consider whether it is so or not , and to regulate your behaviour accordingly .
He cannot want money -- he cannot want leisure .
Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business to be going forward just at this time ?-- Do you imagine it to be the consequence of an immediate commission from him , or that he may have sent only a general direction , an order indefinite as to time , to depend upon contingencies and conveniences ?"
.
A gentleman ' s family is all that I should condition for ."
" But , my dear sir , the difference of the journey ;-- only consider how great it would have been .-- An hundred miles , perhaps , instead of forty ."
" And then , he saved her life .
" I never had the smallest , I assure you ."
She heard Miss Bates ' s voice , something was to be done in a hurry ; the maid looked frightened and awkward ; hoped she would be pleased to wait a moment , and then ushered her in too soon .
" Pretty well , my dear -- I hope -- pretty well .-- I do not know but that the place agrees with her tolerably ."
" Oh !
His face lengthened immediately ; and his voice was the voice of sentiment as he answered .
He will think all the happiness , all the advantage , on your side of the question ; all the merit on mine .
His good sense and good principles would delight you .-- As far as the man is concerned , you could not wish your friend in better hands .
Jane Fairfax ' s perception seemed to accompany his ; her comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning , the superior intelligence , of those five letters so arranged .
I admired your spirit ; and I dare say we shall get home very well .
So I said I would go down and see , and Jane said , ` Shall I go down instead ?
" Thank you , dear Miss Woodhouse , you are all kindness .-- It is impossible to say -- Yes , indeed , I quite understand -- dearest Jane ' s prospects -- that is , I do not mean .-- But she is charmingly recovered .-- How is Mr .
Mr . Knightley was fortunate in every body ' s most ready concurrence .
I always make a point of reading Jane ' s letters through to myself first , before I read them aloud to my mother , you know , for fear of there being any thing in them to distress her .
Now , an attachment to Harriet Smith would have nothing to encounter .
( in a tone of wonder and pity ,) I had no idea that the law had been so great a slavery .
He might have doubled his presumption to me -- but poor Harriet !"
Mr . Martin is a very respectable young man , but I cannot admit him to be Harriet ' s equal ; and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her .
I rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness than I deserve .
` If _Miss_ _Taylor_ undertakes to wrap Miss Emma up , you need not have any fears , sir .'
I think you will agree with me , ( turning with a soft air to Emma ,) I think I shall certainly have your approbation , though Mr . Knightley perhaps , from being used to the large parties of London , may not quite enter into our feelings ."
It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were at Hartfield , which made their presence so acceptable ; for though her first remark , on reading it , was that " of course it must be declined ," she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do , that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful .
" And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess ?-- I pity you .-- I thought you cleverer -- for , depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck .
" But I am afraid , Mr . Elton , Harriet will not like to sit .
He began to suspect him of some double dealing in his pursuit of Emma .
Nobody else would come so early .'
very delightful indeed ; I can say nothing less , for I suppose Miss Woodhouse and Mr . Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that passes .
" Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon ?"
` My friend Knightley ' had been so often mentioned , that I was really impatient to see him ; and I must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend .
he told me all about it ; that Jane Fairfax and Mr . Frank Churchill are to be married , and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while .
But , on the other hand , she could not admit herself to be unhappy , nor , after the first morning , to be less disposed for employment than usual ; she was still busy and cheerful ; and , pleasing as he was , she could yet imagine him to have faults ; and farther , though thinking of him so much , and , as she sat drawing or working , forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment , fancying interesting dialogues , and inventing elegant letters ; the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his side was that she _refused_ _him_ .
I hope she is well ?"
He will be able to tell her how we all are ."
" You do quite right ," said she ;--" we will make your apologies to Mr . and Mrs .
It was a concern which brought just employment enough .
" But you need not imagine Mr . Weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up Henry or John .
It was hot ; and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered , dispersed way , scarcely any three together , they insensibly followed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of limes , which stretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the river , seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds .-- It led to nothing ; nothing but a view at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars , which seemed intended , in their erection , to give the appearance of an approach to the house , which never had been there .
At this moment Mr . Weston appeared at a little distance from the window , evidently on the watch .
The truth of this representation there was no denying .
Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs . Elton , though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her .
Will not the old prejudice be too strong ?"
Early , I know , you had none ."
Campbell ."
I really am a most troublesome companion to you both , but I hope I am not often so ill - equipped .
and I am sure our thanks are due to you , Mrs . Weston , on that score .
One good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal ,-- the ball at the Crown .
It would have killed me never to come to Hartfield any more !"
Had the same behaviour continued , Miss Smith might have been led into a misconception of your views ; not being aware , probably , any more than myself , of the very great inequality which you are so sensible of .
