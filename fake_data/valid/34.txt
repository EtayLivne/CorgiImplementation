I think , Emma , I shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us .
" What an amiable creature I was !-- No wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance ."
" Very bad -- though it might have been worse .-- Playing a most dangerous game .
The acquaintance at present had no charm for her .
I am very little able -- Have you a chair , ma ' am ?
" I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill .-- I can suppose , however , that I may have underrated him .
" I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character , have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before ."
" Highbury gossips !-- Tiresome wretches !"
Emma then looked up , and immediately saw how it was ; and after a moment ' s debate , as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not , replied ,
They would hardly come in their chaise , I think , at that season of the year .
Perry ' s setting up his carriage !
" This was really his ," said Harriet .--" Do not you remember one morning ?-- no , I dare say you do not .
Harriet was not insensible of manner ; she had voluntarily noticed her father ' s gentleness with admiration as well as wonder .
Her second duty now , inferior only to her father ' s claims , was to promote Harriet ' s comfort , and endeavour to prove her own affection in some better method than by match - making .
Consider , she is sitting down -- which naturally presents a different -- which in short gives exactly the idea -- and the proportions must be preserved , you know .
But this good old Mr . Woodhouse , I wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner .
The like reserve prevailed on other topics .
" Do not you think , Miss Woodhouse , our saucy little friend here is charmingly recovered ?-- Do not you think her cure does Perry the highest credit ?--( here was a side - glance of great meaning at Jane .)
But she had believed them to be well - meaning , worthy people before ; and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion ?
If Colonel Campbell is not the person , who can be ?"
But this does not acquit _him_ , Mrs . Weston ; and I must say , that I think him greatly to blame .
You will allow me to bring Jane Fairfax ?"
I could not excuse a man ' s having more music than love -- more ear than eye -- a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings .
There is to be no form or parade -- a sort of gipsy party .
Here is the rivet of your mistress ' s spectacles out .
cried Emma , after a moment ' s pause --" What do you mean ?-- Good Heaven !
that is quite -- I suppose there never was a piece of news more generally interesting .
Do you think I am right ?"
I cannot doubt it .
They had music ; Emma was obliged to play ; and the thanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour , an air of greatness , meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very superior performance .
" A man cannot be more so ," was his short , full answer .
Now I cannot say , that I think you are any of you looking well at present ."
--" The best of all .
In general , it was a very well approved match .
The intermediate month was the one fixed on , as far as they dared , by Emma and Mr .
The spring I always think requires more than common care .
The wedding over , and the bride - people gone , her father and herself were left to dine together , with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening .
This is precisely what I wanted .
When the time proposed drew near , Mrs . Weston ' s fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse .
She considered -- resolved -- and , trying to smile , began --
William Larkins mentioned it here .
She was , besides , which was the worst of all , so cold , so cautious !
" Oh no , no !
What do you imagine his age to be ?"
Though she did not feel the first intelligence as she might have done the day before , or an hour before , its interest soon increased ; and before their first conversation was over , she had talked herself into all the sensations of curiosity , wonder and regret , pain and pleasure , as to this fortunate Miss Hawkins , which could conduce to place the Martins under proper subordination in her fancy .
This discovery laid many smaller matters open .
I am making a conundrum .
Emma saw how Mr . Weston understood these joyous prospects .
But I do not understand how the room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father ' s house ."
" You have , I believe , and know the whole ."
It was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he paid his duty ; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his whole manner to her -- nothing could more agreeably denote his wish of considering her as a friend and securing her affection .
" And when ," thought Emma , " will there be a beginning of Mr .
He did not believe it to proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove , or at least that she might not have many years of existence before her ; but he could not be prevailed on , by all his father ' s doubts , to say that her complaints were merely imaginary , or that she was as strong as ever .
" I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother ," cried Emma , " about your friend Mr . Graham ' s intending to have a bailiff from Scotland , to look after his new estate .
Poor Mr . Elton !
She was deeply ashamed , and a little afraid of his next look .
` It is only Mrs . Cole ,' said I , ` depend upon it .
She is known only as parlour - boarder at a common school .
He is a most charming young man .
So very obliging of Mr . Frank Churchill !
" I am ready ," said Emma , " whenever I am wanted ."
cried Emma , putting her hand before her face , and jumping up , " you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear .
Emma knew this was too true for contradiction , and therefore said nothing .
" Your gallantry is really unanswerable .
They should take care of their health and their complexion .
He came to the Abbey two evenings ago , on purpose to consult me about it .
.
And Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would hear her in any thing else .
I can easily believe that letters are very little to you , much less than to me , but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the difference , it is not age , but situation .
Jane often says , when she is here , ` I am sure , grandmama , you must have had very strong eyes to see as you do -- and so much fine work as you have done too !-- I only wish my eyes may last me as well .'"
then , said I , I must run across , I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in ; my mother will be so very happy to see her -- and now we are such a nice party , she cannot refuse .--` Aye , pray do ,' said Mr . Frank Churchill , ` Miss Woodhouse ' s opinion of the instrument will be worth having .'
But she had believed them to be well - meaning , worthy people before ; and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion ?
" So they will , my dear .
He thought much of the evils of the journey for her , and not a little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some of the party the last half of the way ; but his alarms were needless ; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished , and Mr . and Mrs . John Knightley , their five children , and a competent number of nursery - maids , all reaching Hartfield in safety .
Such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs . Weston .
It was before tea -- stay -- no , it could not be before tea , because we were just going to cards -- and yet it was before tea , because I remember thinking -- Oh !
I can see nothing at all extraordinary in him now .-- I do not care whether I meet him or not -- except that of the two I had rather not see him -- and indeed I would go any distance round to avoid him -- but I do not envy his wife in the least ; I neither admire her nor envy her , as I have done : she is very charming , I dare say , and all that , but I think her very ill - tempered and disagreeable -- I shall never forget her look the other night !-- However , I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , I wish her no evil .-- No , let them be ever so happy together , it will not give me another moment ' s pang : and to convince you that I have been speaking truth , I am now going to destroy -- what I ought to have destroyed long ago -- what I ought never to have kept -- I know that very well ( blushing as she spoke ).-- However , now I will destroy it all -- and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence , that you may see how rational I am grown .
Come , sir , pray let me hear it ."
" Oh !
Now , my dear madam , I will release you ; but I could not conclude before .
She spoke with great agitation ; and Emma very feelingly replied , " That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now .
Frank Churchill comes as regularly into my mind !"
" Or that he did not give her the use of their own instrument -- which must now be shut up in London , untouched by any body ."
And as for James , you may be very sure he will always like going to Randalls , because of his daughter ' s being housemaid there .
" Oh !
" Certainly .
" Impropriety !
Mrs . Smallridge , a most delightful woman !-- A style of living almost equal to Maple Grove -- and as to the children , except the little Sucklings and little Bragges , there are not such elegant sweet children anywhere .
" Something that would do !"
It will be the only difference ."
William Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year .
He might be superseded by another ; he certainly would indeed ; nothing could be clearer ; even a Robert Martin would have been sufficient ; but nothing else , she feared , would cure her .
Her friends evidently thought this good enough for her ; and it _was_ good enough .
" But you will come again ," said Emma .
She heard enough to know that Mr . Weston was giving some information about his son ; she heard the words " my son ," and " Frank ," and " my son ," repeated several times over ; and , from a few other half - syllables very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son ; but before she could quiet Mr . Elton , the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her would have been awkward .
Such talent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknown .-- I dare say you have heard those charming lines of the poet ,
And now she was very conscious that she ought to have prevented them .-- She felt that she had been risking her friend ' s happiness on most insufficient grounds .
This little explanation with Mr . Knightley gave Emma considerable pleasure .
" They would have solicited the honour earlier , but had been waiting the arrival of a folding - screen from London , which they hoped might keep Mr . Woodhouse from any draught of air , and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour of his company ."
Miss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour ; and she had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself , or frighten those who might hate her into outward respect .
