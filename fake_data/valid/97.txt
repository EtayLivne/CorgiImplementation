" Me !
" One can suppose nothing else ," added Mrs . Cole , " and I was only surprized that there could ever have been a doubt .
Donwell and Randalls had received their invitation , and none had come for her father and herself ; and Mrs . Weston ' s accounting for it with " I suppose they will not take the liberty with you ; they know you do not dine out ," was not quite sufficient .
you were perfectly right !
Emma is spoiled by being the cleverest of her family .
He had caught both substance and shadow -- both fortune and affection , and was just the happy man he ought to be ; talking only of himself and his own concerns -- expecting to be congratulated -- ready to be laughed at -- and , with cordial , fearless smiles , now addressing all the young ladies of the place , to whom , a few weeks ago , he would have been more cautiously gallant .
" That you do not give another half - second to the subject .
Selina says it is quite horror to her -- and I believe I have caught a little of her nicety .
They came from Birmingham , which is not a place to promise much , you know , Mr . Weston .
" Here is April come !"
John Knightley ' s being a lawyer is very inconvenient .-- Poor Isabella !-- she is sadly taken away from us all !-- and how sorry she will be when she comes , not to see Miss Taylor here !"
cried Harriet , warmly .
She heard him sigh .
" Me !"
She will not even listen to your questions .
After this , he made some progress without any pause .
" Oh yes !-- that is , no -- I do not know -- but I believe he has read a good deal -- but not what you would think any thing of .
" I do not admire it ," said Mr . Knightley .
Miss Woodhouse , how you do forget !"
" Great has been the pleasure , I am sure .
She opened the packet ; it was too surely so ;-- a note from Mrs . Weston to herself , ushered in the letter from Frank to Mrs . Weston .
Miss Bates was out , which accounted for the previous tranquillity .
He is just as superior as ever ;-- but being married , you know , it is quite a different thing .
" Harriet !"
A cold stormy rain set in , and nothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs , which the wind was despoiling , and the length of the day , which only made such cruel sights the longer visible .
He re - urged -- she re - declined ; and he seemed then about to make his bow , when taking the paper from the table , she returned it --
" Encouragement !-- I give you encouragement !-- Sir , you have been entirely mistaken in supposing it .
and Mrs . Weston is so anxious to be acquainted with him , that she must be almost as happy as yourself ."
" Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills , I fancy ," observed Mr . John Knightley coolly .
After this , he made some progress without any pause .
Mr . Elton was speaking with animation , Harriet listening with a very pleased attention ; and Emma , having sent the child on , was beginning to think how she might draw back a little more , when they both looked around , and she was obliged to join them .
Compare their manner of carrying themselves ; of walking ; of speaking ; of being silent .
One cannot wonder , one cannot wonder .
" She should always send for Perry , if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered , were it only for a moment .
She had been particularly unwell , however , suffering from headache to a degree , which made her aunt declare , that had the ball taken place , she did not think Jane could have attended it ; and it was charity to impute some of her unbecoming indifference to the languor of ill - health .
He was a married man , with only one living child , a girl , about Jane ' s age : and Jane became their guest , paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all ; and before she was nine years old , his daughter ' s great fondness for her , and his own wish of being a real friend , united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her education .
Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent , which no doubt he was in the habit of receiving , to emulate the " Very true , my love ," which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion ; but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer at all .
" You know Miss Fairfax ' s situation in life , I conclude ; what she is destined to be ?"
Mr . Knightley had been telling him something about brewing spruce - beer , and he wanted to put it down ; but when he took out his pencil , there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away , and it would not do , so you lent him another , and this was left upon the table as good for nothing .
Being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling , I have been in no hurry with my congratulations ; but I hope it all went off tolerably well .
The couplet does not cease to be , nor does its meaning change .
" They aimed at wounding more than Harriet ," said he .
" When I got to Donwell ," said he , " Knightley could not be found .
" My being charming , Harriet , is not quite enough to induce me to marry ; I must find other people charming -- one other person at least .
had it , by any blessed felicity , occurred to her , to institute the comparison .-- She saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider Mr . Knightley as infinitely the superior , or when his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear .
After a little more discourse in praise of gruel , with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every body , he proceeded to say , with an air of grave reflection ,
She could never quit him ."
" I would rather be talking to you ," he replied ; " but as it seems a matter of justice , it shall be done ."
He is generally thought a fine young man , but do not expect a prodigy .
Upon my word , Jane on one arm , and me on the other !-- Stop , stop , let us stand a little back , Mrs . Elton is going ; dear Mrs . Elton , how elegant she looks !-- Beautiful lace !-- Now we all follow in her train .
He may be very ` aimable ,' have very good manners , and be very agreeable ; but he can have no English delicacy towards the feelings of other people : nothing really amiable about him ."
In this state Frank Churchill had found her , she trembling and conditioning , they loud and insolent .
Upon the whole , Emma left her with such softened , charitable feelings , as made her look around in walking home , and lament that Highbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence ; nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her .
When the gloves were bought , and they had quitted the shop again , " Did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of , play ?"
I only name possibilities .
" And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking ?"
To be sure , the charade , with its " ready wit "-- but then the " soft eyes "-- in fact it suited neither ; it was a jumble without taste or truth .
Do not let mine continue longer .
" What is the matter now ?"
Some are gone to the ponds , and some to the lime walk .
This is the simple truth ."
Mr . Woodhouse told me of it .
She wished him to speak , but he would not .
for myself , I protest I must be excused ," said Mrs . Elton ; " _I_ really cannot attempt -- I am not at all fond of the sort of thing .
She had been a friend and companion such as few possessed : intelligent , well - informed , useful , gentle , knowing all the ways of the family , interested in all its concerns , and peculiarly interested in herself , in every pleasure , every scheme of hers -- one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose , and who had such an affection for her as could never find fault .
Knightley .--" Emma , that I fear is a word -- No , I have no wish -- Stay , yes , why should I hesitate ?-- I have gone too far already for concealment .-- Emma , I accept your offer -- Extraordinary as it may seem , I accept it , and refer myself to you as a friend .-- Tell me , then , have I no chance of ever succeeding ?"
-- If he would say so to her at once , in the tone of decision becoming a man , there would be no opposition made to his going ."
He had business at the Crown about his hay , and a great many errands for Mrs . Weston at Ford ' s , but he need not hurry any body else ."
In the course of the spring she must return their civilities by one very superior party -- in which her card - tables should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs in the true style -- and more waiters engaged for the evening than their own establishment could furnish , to carry round the refreshments at exactly the proper hour , and in the proper order .
How do you do ?-- Very well , I thank you .
I shall hear of every thing that is going on among you .
But she was always right .
I hope you turned directly ."
They were soon joined by some of the gentlemen ; and the very first of the early was Frank Churchill .
Her pardon was duly begged at the close of the song , and every thing usual followed .
In no other light could you have been more to me than a common acquaintance .
Though now the middle of December , there had yet been no weather to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise ; and on the morrow , Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family , who lived a little way out of Highbury .
You were very popular before you came , because you were Mr . Weston ' s son -- but lay out half a guinea at Ford ' s , and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues ."
I do not wonder at you .
" Thank you , but I would rather you did not mention the subject to her ; till the time draws nearer , I do not wish to be giving any body trouble ."
" Dear Mrs . Weston , how could you think of such a thing ?-- Mr .
" There it is .
This was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by , and Mr . Weston , with a very good grace , immediately exclaimed ,
High in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities , was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from Mr . Knightley would soon be over .
There will be enough for every hope and every fear ; and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent , it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder .
It was a sad event -- a great shock -- with all her faults , what would Mr . Churchill do without her ?
I think you will agree with me , ( turning with a soft air to Emma ,) I think I shall certainly have your approbation , though Mr . Knightley perhaps , from being used to the large parties of London , may not quite enter into our feelings ."
This was all very promising ; and , but for such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut , there was nothing to denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him ; the honour , if not of being really in love with her , of being at least very near it , and saved only by her own indifference -- ( for still her resolution held of never marrying )-- the honour , in short , of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance .
Very sincerely did Emma wish to do so ; but it was not immediately in her power .
" Oh !
They all united ; and , on reaching Hartfield gates , Emma , who knew it was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her father , pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him .
Jane speaks so distinct !
" You mean to return a favourable answer , I collect ."
-- If he would say so to her at once , in the tone of decision becoming a man , there would be no opposition made to his going ."
She knows I would not offend for the world .
He was on the move immediately ; but coming back , said ,
They sat down to tea -- the same party round the same table -- how often it had been collected !-- and how often had her eyes fallen on the same shrubs in the lawn , and observed the same beautiful effect of the western sun !-- But never in such a state of spirits , never in any thing like it ; and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house , or even the attentive daughter .
Sixteen miles -- nay , eighteen -- it must be full eighteen to Manchester - street -- was a serious obstacle .
Tell me how Miss Fairfax is ."
Her mind returned to Mrs . Elton ' s offences , and long , very long , did they occupy her .
