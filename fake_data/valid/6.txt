He did not know what was come to his master lately , he said , but he could hardly ever get the speech of him .
Oh !
Emma did not want to be classed with the Mrs . Eltons , the Mrs . Perrys , and the Mrs . Coles , who would force themselves anywhere ; neither could she feel any right of preference herself -- she submitted , therefore , and only questioned Miss Bates farther as to her niece ' s appetite and diet , which she longed to be able to assist .
no ," said he ; " it would be the extreme of imprudence .
yes "-- he replied ; " I was just going to mention it .
" Oh !"
I must confess it is a recommendation to me .
" Me !"
" But where could _you_ hear it ?"
They walked off , followed in half a minute by Mr . Knightley .
We must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax ."
But neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once , and Emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time .
I am very little able -- Have you a chair , ma ' am ?
And ever since she was twelve , Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all .
The name makes me think of poor Isabella ; for she was very near being christened Catherine after her grandmama .
Better pass it off as a joke .
" Ah !
" Oh !"
He must know that the Woodhouses had been settled for several generations at Hartfield , the younger branch of a very ancient family -- and that the Eltons were nobody .
Harriet said , " very true ," and she " would not think about it ;" but still she talked of it -- still she could talk of nothing else ; and Emma , at last , in order to put the Martins out of her head , was obliged to hurry on the news , which she had meant to give with so much tender caution ; hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry , ashamed or only amused , at such a state of mind in poor Harriet -- such a conclusion of Mr . Elton ' s importance with her !
I must get on to Kingston as fast as I can ."
Heavens !
" Depend upon it , Elton will not do .
--" She believed he was reckoned a very fine young man ."
Ah !
These were very cheering thoughts ; and the sight of a great deal of snow on the ground did her further service , for any thing was welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder at present .
He might be able to join them in the evening , but certainly not to dinner .
He had long made up his mind to Jane Fairfax ' s going out as governess , and could talk of it cheerfully , but Mr . Knightley ' s going to London had been an unexpected blow .
" That sweet , amiable Jane Fairfax !"
" And so you actually put this piece of court - plaister by for his sake !"
Oh !
Jane Fairfax ' s perception seemed to accompany his ; her comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning , the superior intelligence , of those five letters so arranged .
" But why should you be sorry , sir ?-- I assure you , it did the children a great deal of good ."
You have drawn two pretty pictures ; but I think there may be a third -- a something between the do - nothing and the do - all .
Her cheeks flushed at the name , and she felt afraid of something , though she knew not what .
Perry ?-- Has he been here this morning ?-- And how does he travel now ?-- Has he set up his carriage ?"
They could go there again with them in the autumn .
At last Emma attacked her on another ground .
Such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs . Weston .
She was ready to tell every thing in her power , but on this subject questions were vain .
You , Miss Woodhouse , I well know , play delightfully .
" Oh !
Cole was saying the other day she wanted something from Kingston ."
The naivete of Miss Smith ' s manners -- and altogether -- Oh , it is most admirable !
Mrs . Cole was telling that she had been calling on Miss Bates , and as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight of a pianoforte -- a very elegant looking instrument -- not a grand , but a large - sized square pianoforte ; and the substance of the story , the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize , and inquiry , and congratulations on her side , and explanations on Miss Bates ' s , was , that this pianoforte had arrived from Broadwood ' s the day before , to the great astonishment of both aunt and niece -- entirely unexpected ; that at first , by Miss Bates ' s account , Jane herself was quite at a loss , quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it -- but now , they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only one quarter ;-- of course it must be from Colonel Campbell .
and to see you in such excellent looks !-- I would not have missed this meeting for the world .
Nobody else would come so early .'
Certainly , delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions , Mrs . Elton .
She had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from her heart , for he stopped to hand her out .
He and Mrs . Weston were both dreadfully desponding .
They are good - natured people , and think little of their own claims ; but still they must feel that any body ' s hurrying away is no great compliment ; and Miss Woodhouse ' s doing it would be more thought of than any other person ' s in the room .
CHAPTER XVIII
He _had_ despaired at one period ; he had received such an injunction to caution and silence , as for the time crushed every hope ;-- she had begun by refusing to hear him .-- The change had perhaps been somewhat sudden ;-- her proposal of taking another turn , her renewing the conversation which she had just put an end to , might be a little extraordinary !-- She felt its inconsistency ; but Mr . Knightley was so obliging as to put up with it , and seek no farther explanation .
Miss Bates ' s powerful , argumentative mind might have strengthened yours ."
Emma shall be an angel , and I will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John and Isabella .
I do not know who would ever look at him in the company of the other .
" I am ,"-- she answered --" I am fatigued ; but it is not the sort of fatigue -- quick walking will refresh me .-- Miss Woodhouse , we all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits .
That she was not immediately ready , Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves ; she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion ; she must reason herself into the power of performance ; and Emma could not but pity such feelings , whatever their origin , and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again .
" I have not a fault to find with her person ," he replied .
Oh no !
" Well , I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does , or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out .
-- Bad enough as it is , for I absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree .-- I believe I have not played a bar this fortnight .-- However , he is coming , I assure you : yes , indeed , on purpose to wait on you all ."
Every body who sees it is struck by its beauty ; but to me , it has been quite a home .
Charming people , Mr . and Mrs . Weston ;-- Mrs . Weston indeed is much beyond praise , and he is exactly what one values , so hospitable , and so fond of society ;-- it will be a small party , but where small parties are select , they are perhaps the most agreeable of any .
.
" Emma ," said she , " this paper is worse than I expected .
You must take care of yourself , Mrs .
Only half an hour before her friend called for her at Mrs . Goddard ' s , her evil stars had led her to the very spot where , at that moment , a trunk , directed to _The_ _Rev . _ _Philip_ _Elton_ , _White - Hart_ , _Bath_ , was to be seen under the operation of being lifted into the butcher ' s cart , which was to convey it to where the coaches past ; and every thing in this world , excepting that trunk and the direction , was consequently a blank .
It was a pity , perhaps , that he had not come last night ; for , though the child seemed well now , very well considering , it would probably have been better if Perry had seen it ."
You are too obliging , my dear Miss Woodhouse ; but we really must take leave .
We must allow for the effect of shade , you know ."
Name your day , and I will come .
" Certainly -- very strong it was ; to own the truth , a great deal stronger than , if _I_ had been Miss Campbell , would have been at all agreeable to me .
Emma ' s politeness was at hand directly , to say , with smiling interest --
They met readily and smiling , but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said ; and having all sat down again , there was for some time such a blank in the circle , that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged , which she had long felt , of seeing Frank Churchill once more , and of seeing him with Jane , would yield its proportion of pleasure .
Mr . Martin is now awkward and abrupt ; what will he be at Mr . Weston ' s time of life ?"
It was dreadfully mortifying ; but Mr . Elton was proving himself , in many respects , the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him ; proud , assuming , conceited ; very full of his own claims , and little concerned about the feelings of others .
" Ah !"
" I have no hesitation in saying ," replied Mr . Elton , though hesitating a good deal while he spoke ; " I have no hesitation in saying -- at least if my friend feels at all as _I_ do -- I have not the smallest doubt that , could he see his little effusion honoured as _I_ see it , ( looking at the book again , and replacing it on the table ), he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life ."
And I hope she will be better off in one respect , and not be induced to go away after it has been her home so long ."
There was no bearing such an " always ;" and to break through her dreadful gratitude , Emma made the direct inquiry of --
it shews what a sad invalid I am !
Ten couple may stand here very well ."
She looked on with some amusement .-- Miss Bates ' s gratitude for Mrs . Elton ' s attentions to Jane was in the first style of guileless simplicity and warmth .
They have more gentleness .
For a little while Emma persevered in her silence ; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that letter might be too powerful , she thought it best to say ,
I think , Miss Woodhouse , you and I must establish a musical club , and have regular weekly meetings at your house , or ours .
The real evils , indeed , of Emma ' s situation were the power of having rather too much her own way , and a disposition to think a little too well of herself ; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments .
No , I would not be the means of giving them any pain .
Mrs . Elton ' s invitations I should have imagined any thing but inviting ."
It is such a blessing !
" Yes ," said Harriet earnestly , " and well she might , nobody could ever have a better .
perfectly .
He was on foot , and after looking very respectfully at her , looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion .
` Oh !'
The circumstance was told him at Hartfield ; for the moment , he was silent ; but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself , over a newspaper he held in his hand , " Hum !
good Mr . Perry -- how is he , sir ?"
But why must she consent to be with the Eltons ?-- Here is quite a separate puzzle ."
" Poor Mr . and Miss Woodhouse , if you please ; but I cannot possibly say ` poor Miss Taylor .'
My courage rises while I write .
