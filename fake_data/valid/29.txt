This proves that he can leave the Churchills ."
As long as Mr . Knightley remained with them , Emma ' s fever continued ; but when he was gone , she began to be a little tranquillised and subdued -- and in the course of the sleepless night , which was the tax for such an evening , she found one or two such very serious points to consider , as made her feel , that even her happiness must have some alloy .
And when he was gone , she almost quarrelled with me -- No , I should not say quarrelled , for we never had a quarrel in our lives ; but she was quite distressed that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone ; she wished I had made him believe we had a great many left .
my dear sir , how are you this morning ?
The compliment was just returned , coldly and proudly ; and , under indescribable irritation of spirits , she was then conveyed to Hartfield .
I am sure I had much rather hear you .
But just got acquainted with Mrs . Weston , and others !-- I hate the recollection ."
I was not aware of it myself .
Of course I have not transcribed beyond the first eight lines ."
" Excuse me ," said Jane earnestly , " I cannot by any means consent to such an arrangement , so needlessly troublesome to your servant .
But , Mr . Knightley , how could you possibly have heard it ?
The Eltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings , and of the use to be made of their barouche - landau ; and Jane Fairfax was still at her grandmother ' s ; and as the return of the Campbells from Ireland was again delayed , and August , instead of Midsummer , fixed for it , she was likely to remain there full two months longer , provided at least she were able to defeat Mrs . Elton ' s activity in her service , and save herself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her will .
" Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ ," said Frank Churchill , with a smile at Emma , " the person has not chosen ill .
I have been making discoveries and forming plans , just like yourself , and I must tell them while the idea is fresh .
" I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between them -- certain expressive looks , which I did not believe meant to be public ."
replied he .
" Yes ; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction .
-- with many other relative questions , all answered with patient politeness .
" Good God !"
" I shall never be easy till I have seen some of these places .
" Nay , how could I help saying what I did ?-- Nobody could have helped it .
How could you be so insolent in your wit to a woman of her character , age , and situation ?-- Emma , I had not thought it possible ."
Does Mrs . Churchill do the same ?"
And putting up her hand to screen her words from Emma --" A congratulatory visit , you know .-- Oh !
" Was he handsome ?"
And I know he has read the Vicar of Wakefield .
" My dear sir , do not make a stranger of me ."
" Ah !--( shaking his head )-- the uncertainty of when I may be able to return !-- I shall try for it with a zeal !-- It will be the object of all my thoughts and cares !-- and if my uncle and aunt go to town this spring -- but I am afraid -- they did not stir last spring -- I am afraid it is a custom gone for ever ."
.
Mr . Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick leather gaiters , and either the exertion of getting them together , or some other cause , brought the colour into his face , as he answered ,
He had come , in his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill ' s engagement , with no selfish view , no view at all , but of endeavouring , if she allowed him an opening , to soothe or to counsel her .-- The rest had been the work of the moment , the immediate effect of what he heard , on his feelings .
She still intended him for her friend .
Miss Nash had been telling her something , which she repeated immediately with great delight .
" Elegant , agreeable manners , I was prepared for ," said he ; " but I confess that , considering every thing , I had not expected more than a very tolerably well - looking woman of a certain age ; I did not know that I was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs .
Acquit me here , and procure for me , when it is allowable , the acquittal and good wishes of that said Emma Woodhouse , whom I regard with so much brotherly affection , as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself .-- Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight , you have now a key to .
I should be sorry to be more ."
" _You_ probably have been less surprized than any of us , for you have had your suspicions .-- I have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution .-- I wish I had attended to it -- but --( with a sinking voice and a heavy sigh ) I seem to have been doomed to blindness ."
" Yes -- entirely her own doing , entirely her own choice ; and Colonel and Mrs . Campbell think she does quite right , just what they should recommend ; and indeed they particularly _wish_ her to try her native air , as she has not been quite so well as usual lately ."
Jane will be only four miles from Maple Grove ."
That was the kind action ; that was the noble benevolence and generosity ; that was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he was to every other being upon earth ."
Harriet was silent .
" That may be , and I may have seen him fifty times , but without having any idea of his name .
Now , according to my idea of Mrs . Churchill , it would be most natural , that while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband , to whom she owes every thing , while she exercises incessant caprice towards _him_ , she should frequently be governed by the nephew , to whom she owes nothing at all ."
His admiration was certainly very warm ; yet she thought , but for Mrs . Weston , it would not have struck her .
And how tired you must be after your journey !
Pray , dear Miss Woodhouse , tell me what I ought to do ."
She allowed him to talk , and arranged the glasses , and wrapped herself up , without opening her lips .
Very pleasant party .
But ( with a reproachful smile at Emma ) she receives attentions from Mrs . Elton , which nobody else pays her ."
" But every thing of that kind ," said Emma , " will soon be in so regular a train --"
" Me !"
Mrs . Bates and Mrs . Elton were together .
His evils seemed to lessen , her own advantages to increase , their mutual good to outweigh every drawback .
Time , however , she thought , would tell him that they ought to be friends again .
I had no hesitation in advising him to marry .
Still , however , though every thing had not been accomplished by her ingenious device , she could not but flatter herself that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both , and must be leading them forward to the great event .
They were permitted to go alone ; and with a cordial nod from one , and a graceful bow from the other , the two gentlemen took leave .
Emma returned her friend ' s pressure with interest ; and was pleased enough to exclaim ,
I will tell you exactly what I think ."
Mr . Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick leather gaiters , and either the exertion of getting them together , or some other cause , brought the colour into his face , as he answered ,
It is his own idea .
He saw a short word prepared for Emma , and given to her with a look sly and demure .
He could be no judge , however , of the evil he was holding cheap .
A great deal of very reasonable , very just displeasure I had to persuade away .
It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were at Hartfield , which made their presence so acceptable ; for though her first remark , on reading it , was that " of course it must be declined ," she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do , that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful .
She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from Mr . Elton , and now did full justice to ; and Harriet blushed and smiled , and said she had always thought Mr . Elton very agreeable .
Mr . Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade .
She absolutely refused to allow me , which I then thought most unreasonable .
It will do you good to speak of your distress , whatever it may be ."
Emma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr . Knightley till after supper ; but , when they were all in the ballroom again , her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked .
exclaimed Mr . Knightley loudly and warmly ; and with calmer asperity , added , a few moments afterwards , " No , he is not her equal indeed , for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation .
They had been meeting almost every day since his arrival .
Had it taken place only once a year , it would have been a grievance .
Emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey ; and walking a few yards forward , while they talked together , soon made her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with Mr . Robert Martin .
" I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her .
Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet ' s fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose , for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr . Elton ' s being a remarkably handsome man , with most agreeable manners ; and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints , she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on Harriet ' s side , as there could be any occasion for .
Emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from their knowing each other , which had taken strong possession of her mind , had ever crossed his ; and whether his compliments were to be considered as marks of acquiescence , or proofs of defiance .
I think , Miss Woodhouse , you and I must establish a musical club , and have regular weekly meetings at your house , or ours .
He remained at Hartfield after all the rest , his thoughts full of what he had seen ; so full , that when the candles came to assist his observations , he must -- yes , he certainly must , as a friend -- an anxious friend -- give Emma some hint , ask her some question .
There were wishes at Randalls respecting Emma ' s destiny , but it was not desirable to have them suspected ; and the quiet transition which Mr . Knightley soon afterwards made to " What does Weston think of the weather ; shall we have rain ?"
" No , not at Randalls ; I have not been near Randalls ," when the door was thrown open , and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room .
" I have not even made any inquiry ; I do not wish to make any yet ."
Mr . Frank Churchill still declined it , looking as serious as he could , and his father gave his hearty support by calling out , " My good friend , this is quite unnecessary ; Frank knows a puddle of water when he sees it , and as to Mrs . Bates ' s , he may get there from the Crown in a hop , step , and jump ."
" It is a sort of thing ," cried Mrs . Elton emphatically , " which _I_ should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into .
Either bathing has been of the greatest service to her , or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of Mr . Wingfield ' s , which we have been applying at times ever since August ."
Though I think he had better not have married .
And as I looked at her , though I never saw her appear to more advantage , it struck me that she was heated , and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold .
It was a very extraordinary thing !
said she , beginning again when they were all in the street .
You quite shock me ; if you mean a fling at the slave - trade , I assure you Mr . Suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition ."
She asked no more questions therefore , merely employed her own fancy , and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money concern -- something just come to light , of a disagreeable nature in the circumstances of the family ,-- something which the late event at Richmond had brought forward .
She believed every body found his manners pleasing ."
Mr . Elton , who might marry any body !
I feel that all the apologies should be on my side .
He was a married man , with only one living child , a girl , about Jane ' s age : and Jane became their guest , paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all ; and before she was nine years old , his daughter ' s great fondness for her , and his own wish of being a real friend , united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her education .
" Oh !
" Oh !
The invitation was refused , and by a verbal message .
Proportions , fore - shortening .-- Oh no !
Mr . Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young farmer out of Harriet ' s head .
