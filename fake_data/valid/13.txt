She checked herself , however , and submitted quietly to a little more praise than she deserved .
If any thing , you are too attentive .
" I dare say they are , sir .
I am sure she will be an excellent servant ; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see .
And though the consequent shock and alarm was very great and much more durable -- indeed I believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again -- yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable .
It seemed too precious an offering for any degree of publicity .
" You are expecting her again , you say , this morning ?"
Mr . Knightley could not be there too often ; he should be glad to see him every day ;-- but they did see him every day as it was .-- Why could not they go on as they had done ?
Emma ' s project of forgetting Mr . Elton for a while made her rather sorry to find , when they had all taken their places , that he was close to her .
" Yes , certainly it does .
Read it in comfort to yourself .
But here there was nothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future .
She felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant , as she viewed the respectable size and style of the building , its suitable , becoming , characteristic situation , low and sheltered -- its ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream , of which the Abbey , with all the old neglect of prospect , had scarcely a sight -- and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues , which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up .-- The house was larger than Hartfield , and totally unlike it , covering a good deal of ground , rambling and irregular , with many comfortable , and one or two handsome rooms .-- It was just what it ought to be , and it looked what it was -- and Emma felt an increasing respect for it , as the residence of a family of such true gentility , untainted in blood and understanding .-- Some faults of temper John Knightley had ; but Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably .
Her person was rather good ; her face not unpretty ; but neither feature , nor air , nor voice , nor manner , were elegant .
If I could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired -- but is Mrs . Stokes to be trusted ?
" Mrs . Cole has servants to send .
Jane did not look round .
He praised her for being without art or affectation , for having simple , honest , generous , feelings .-- She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet ; he had dwelt on them to her more than once .-- Much that lived in Harriet ' s memory , many little particulars of the notice she had received from him , a look , a speech , a removal from one chair to another , a compliment implied , a preference inferred , had been unnoticed , because unsuspected , by Emma .
Poor little dears , how glad they will be to come .
" Ah !
There go you and your riddle - book one of these days ."
A sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded by her general state , had carried her off after a short struggle .
" To be sure -- our discordancies must always arise from my being in the wrong ."
and Mrs . Weston is so anxious to be acquainted with him , that she must be almost as happy as yourself ."
-- which my mother , being on the watch , heard distinctly , and was sadly alarmed at .
But why must she consent to be with the Eltons ?-- Here is quite a separate puzzle ."
And so she began inquiring after her directly , saying , ` I know you cannot have heard from Jane lately , because it is not her time for writing ;' and when I immediately said , ` But indeed we have , we had a letter this very morning ,' I do not know that I ever saw any body more surprized .
" Well !
Not more than five couple could be mustered ; but the rarity and the suddenness of it made it very delightful , and she found herself well matched in a partner .
" Never , madam ," cried he , affronted in his turn : " never , I assure you .
The scene enlarged ; two persons appeared ; Mrs . Weston and her son - in - law ; they were walking into Highbury ;-- to Hartfield of course .
Walk home !-- you are prettily shod for walking home , I dare say .
We talked it all over with Mr . Weston last night .
" Yes -- entirely her own doing , entirely her own choice ; and Colonel and Mrs . Campbell think she does quite right , just what they should recommend ; and indeed they particularly _wish_ her to try her native air , as she has not been quite so well as usual lately ."
Harriet was to be there in the evening , and the Bateses .
That ' s very like .
Let me not suppose that she dares go about , Emma Woodhouse - ing me !-- But upon my honour , there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman ' s tongue !"
" True , true ," he answered , warmly .
Mrs . Cole seemed to be relating something of her that was expected to be very interesting .
Can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations ?
It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin .
I have spent so many happy months there !
We all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou , the plainest spoken amongst us ; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other -- a something more early implanted .
" But , my dear sir , the difference of the journey ;-- only consider how great it would have been .-- An hundred miles , perhaps , instead of forty ."
We never were so long without seeing her before , and as I was telling Mrs . Cole , we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now ."
At this moment whom are you thinking of ?"
" They talked a great deal about him , especially Anne Cox .
" I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind ; but excuse me , Mr . Knightley , if I take the liberty ( I consider myself , you know , as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma ' s mother might have had ) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith ' s intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you .
Both felt rather anxious to hear him speak again ; and after a few minutes silence , he said ,
These were very cheering thoughts ; and the sight of a great deal of snow on the ground did her further service , for any thing was welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder at present .
And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts her civilities and consents to be with her .
Every body who saw it was pleased , but Mr . Elton was in continual raptures , and defended it through every criticism .
Of course I have not transcribed beyond the first eight lines ."
I may not have convinced you perhaps , but I am perfectly convinced myself that Mr . Dixon is a principal in the business ."
I knew he would !"
It is very good advice , and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often found ; for it shall be attended to ."
He was soon pretty well resigned .
I like them all ."
Mr . John Knightley smiled , and replied ,
" Well , well , I am ready ;"-- and turning again to Emma , " but you must not be expecting such a _very_ fine young man ; you have only had _my_ account you know ; I dare say he is really nothing extraordinary :"-- though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very different conviction .
Harriet was silent .
It was too old a story .-- Robert Martin had probably ceased to think of Harriet .-- They took a few turns together along the walk .-- The shade was most refreshing , and Emma found it the pleasantest part of the day .
But now she made the sudden resolution of not passing their door without going in -- observing , as she proposed it to Harriet , that , as well as she could calculate , they were just now quite safe from any letter from Jane Fairfax .
Had you not been surrounded by other friends , I might have been tempted to introduce a subject , to ask questions , to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct .-- I feel that I should certainly have been impertinent ."
She was evidently displeased ; looked up , and seeing herself watched , blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her , and saying only , " I did not know that proper names were allowed ," pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit , and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered .
You have shewn that you can dance , and you know we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper ."
It then occurred to her to employ him in reading .
You , ( to Emma ), I am certain , will never guess .-- I will tell you .-- M .
you are not serious now .
It would only be giving trouble and distress .
He was dining with the Randalls family , and Jane , at the Eltons '; and he had seen a look , more than a single look , at Miss Fairfax , which , from the admirer of Miss Woodhouse , seemed somewhat out of place .
The carriage -- we had disappointments about the carriage ;-- one morning , I remember , he came to me quite in despair ."
Mr . Frank Churchill still declined it , looking as serious as he could , and his father gave his hearty support by calling out , " My good friend , this is quite unnecessary ; Frank knows a puddle of water when he sees it , and as to Mrs . Bates ' s , he may get there from the Crown in a hop , step , and jump ."
Mrs . Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note , or we should have been .-- But two such offers in one day !-- Never were such neighbours .
It was settled that they should go to Box Hill .
Emma was ready for her visitor some time before he appeared ; but if this reflected at all upon his impatience , his sorrowful look and total want of spirits when he did come might redeem him .
The weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move ; and Mr . Woodhouse having , as usual , tried to persuade his daughter to stay behind with all her children , was obliged to see the whole party set off , and return to his lamentations over the destiny of poor Isabella ;-- which poor Isabella , passing her life with those she doated on , full of their merits , blind to their faults , and always innocently busy , might have been a model of right feminine happiness .
It crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend ' s leaving Highbury , for the sake of her being settled so well .
They met readily and smiling , but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said ; and having all sat down again , there was for some time such a blank in the circle , that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged , which she had long felt , of seeing Frank Churchill once more , and of seeing him with Jane , would yield its proportion of pleasure .
" She could not compose herself -- Mr . Woodhouse would be alarmed -- she had better go ;"-- with most ready encouragement from her friend , therefore , she passed off through another door -- and the moment she was gone , this was the spontaneous burst of Emma ' s feelings : " Oh God !
She did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife , though growing very like her ;-- _she_ spoke some of her feelings , by observing audibly to her partner ,
His mother and sisters were very fond of him .
Knightley must not marry !-- You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell ?-- Oh !
madam ," cried Emma , " if other children are at all like what I remember to have been myself , I should think five times the amount of what I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions , dearly earned ."
" Very well .
Her father ' s comfort was amply secured , Mrs . Bates as well as Mrs . Goddard being able to come ; and her last pleasing duty , before she left the house , was to pay her respects to them as they sat together after dinner ; and while her father was fondly noticing the beauty of her dress , to make the two ladies all the amends in her power , by helping them to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine , for whatever unwilling self - denial his care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise during the meal .-- She had provided a plentiful dinner for them ; she wished she could know that they had been allowed to eat it .
Here am I come down for only one day , and you are engaged with a dinner - party !-- When did it happen before , or any thing like it ?
Better than nearer !
Acquit me here , and procure for me , when it is allowable , the acquittal and good wishes of that said Emma Woodhouse , whom I regard with so much brotherly affection , as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself .-- Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight , you have now a key to .
He had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her some walnuts , because she had said how fond she was of them , and in every thing else he was so very obliging .
" If I know myself , Harriet , mine is an active , busy mind , with a great many independent resources ; and I do not perceive why I should be more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one - and - twenty .
He began speaking of Harriet , and speaking of her with more voluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before .
I have a very sincere interest in Emma .
She meant to take her in the carriage , leave her at the Abbey Mill , while she drove a little farther , and call for her again so soon , as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous recurrences to the past , and give the most decided proof of what degree of intimacy was chosen for the future .
Do not run away with such an idea ."
" What a comfort it is , that we think alike about our nephews and nieces .
Gilbert would have danced the other evening , if she had been asked .
You like Mr . Elton , papa ,-- I must look about for a wife for him .
In short , I have made a match between Mr . Knightley and Jane Fairfax .
he is off .
