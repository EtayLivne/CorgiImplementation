While they are with us , we shall explore a great deal , I dare say .
And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my three turns -- my winter walk ."
" Oh !
The listeners were amused ; and Mrs . Weston gave Emma a look of particular meaning .
It was quite a different sort of thing , a sentiment distinct and independent .
Their propriety , simplicity , and elegance , would make them the safest model for any young woman ."
What !-- engaged to her all the winter -- before either of them came to Highbury ?"
I do not know what she meant , but she asked me if I thought I should go and stay there again next summer ."
Harriet had not surmised her own danger , but the idea of it struck her forcibly .
Mr . Knightley loves to find fault with me , you know -- in a joke -- it is all a joke .
Well , time does fly indeed !-- and my memory is very bad .
She was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms , at the poor attempt at rout - cakes , and there being no ice in the Highbury card - parties .
I assure you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in private life ."
impossible !"
but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand .
Emma watched and decided , that with such feelings as were now shewn , it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting himself ; that he had not been acting a part , or making a parade of insincere professions ; and that Mr . Knightley certainly had not done him justice .
I was sure it could not be far off ; but I had put my huswife upon it , you see , without being aware , and so it was quite hid , but I had it in my hand so very lately that I was almost sure it must be on the table .
" Exactly so -- The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth -- I have not a doubt of your success .
" I wish you may not get into a scrape , Harriet , whenever he does marry ;-- I mean , as to being acquainted with his wife -- for though his sisters , from a superior education , are not to be altogether objected to , it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice .
Such a beautiful hind - quarter of pork !
She was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy wife together , without feeling uncomfortable .
The style of the letter was much above her expectation .
Emma wondered on what , of all the medley , she would fix .
They were entering the hall .
I have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure .
" No , I thank you .
Miss Bates was very chatty and good - humoured , as she always is , though she speaks rather too quick .
Emma could not but feel all this ; and then , her face -- her features -- there was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered ; it was not regular , but it was very pleasing beauty .
They met Mr . Martin the very next day , as they were walking on the Donwell road .
" It was an awkward business , my dear , your spending the autumn at South End instead of coming here .
Such another scheme , composed of so many ill - assorted people , she hoped never to be betrayed into again .
" Ah !
Not that I imagine he can think I have been encouraging him hitherto .
The party was rather large , as it included one other family , a proper unobjectionable country family , whom the Coles had the advantage of naming among their acquaintance , and the male part of Mr . Cox ' s family , the lawyer of Highbury .
" Mr . Knightley and Jane Fairfax !"
She is reserved , more reserved , I think , than she used to be -- And I love an open temper .
Mr . Woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the utmost that his nerves could bear -- and here would be a ninth -- and Emma apprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even to Hartfield for forty - eight hours without falling in with a dinner - party .
But " she could never get acquainted with her : she did not know how it was , but there was such coldness and reserve -- such apparent indifference whether she pleased or not -- and then , her aunt was such an eternal talker !-- and she was made such a fuss with by every body !-- and it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate -- because their ages were the same , every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other ."
Mr . Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his friend Perry , to whom he had , in fact , though unconsciously , been attributing many of his own feelings and expressions ;-- but the soothing attentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil , and the immediate alertness of one brother , and better recollections of the other , prevented any renewal of it .
Some portion of respect for herself , however , in spite of all these demerits -- some concern for her own appearance , and a strong sense of justice by Harriet --( there would be no need of _compassion_ to the girl who believed herself loved by Mr . Knightley -- but justice required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now ,) gave Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness , with even apparent kindness .-- For her own advantage indeed , it was fit that the utmost extent of Harriet ' s hopes should be enquired into ; and Harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained -- or to deserve to be slighted by the person , whose counsels had never led her right .-- Rousing from reflection , therefore , and subduing her emotion , she turned to Harriet again , and , in a more inviting accent , renewed the conversation ; for as to the subject which had first introduced it , the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax , that was quite sunk and lost .-- Neither of them thought but of Mr . Knightley and themselves .
" I think she must be here soon ," said he .
The quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for Mr . Woodhouse , who had often been distressed by the more animated sort , which Mr . Weston had occasionally introduced , and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting , with tender melancholy , over the departure of the " poor little boys ," or in fondly pointing out , as he took up any stray letter near him , how beautifully Emma had written it .
He could now , without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise , without a glance forward at any possible treachery in his guest , give way to all his natural kind - hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after Mr . Frank Churchill ' s accommodation on his journey , through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road , and express very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he had certainly escaped catching cold -- which , however , he could not allow him to feel quite assured of himself till after another night .
It reminded her of their first forlorn tete - a - tete , on the evening of Mrs . Weston ' s wedding - day ; but Mr . Knightley had walked in then , soon after tea , and dissipated every melancholy fancy .
Perry tells me that Mr . Cole never touches malt liquor .
I do not care for myself .
Now I cannot say , that I think you are any of you looking well at present ."
She made her plan ; she would speak of something totally different -- the children in Brunswick Square ; and she only waited for breath to begin , when Mr . Knightley startled her , by saying ,
" But , Mr . Knightley , she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor , and I am sure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for ."
Miss Churchill , however , being of age , and with the full command of her fortune -- though her fortune bore no proportion to the family - estate -- was not to be dissuaded from the marriage , and it took place , to the infinite mortification of Mr . and Mrs . Churchill , who threw her off with due decorum .
" Say nothing , my dear Emma , while you oblige me to read -- not even of Mrs . Elton .
I knew you would wish it .
" You are better placed _here_ ; very fit for a wife , but not at all for a governess .
Those who are standing by are usually thinking of something very different ."
When he was speaking of it in that way , I honestly said that _the_ _world_ I could give up -- parties , balls , plays -- for I had no fear of retirement .
This was all sent with the instrument .
There was instant pleasure in the sight of them , and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound -- for Mr . Weston immediately accosted her with ,
Many a time has Selina said , when she has been going to Bristol , ` I really cannot get this girl to move from the house .
No doubt he is a sensible man , and I suppose may have a natural talent for -- thinks strongly and clearly -- and when he takes a pen in hand , his thoughts naturally find proper words .
And such a noble fire !-- I am quite roasted .
" How sorry I am !
You must grant me that ."
He may be very ` aimable ,' have very good manners , and be very agreeable ; but he can have no English delicacy towards the feelings of other people : nothing really amiable about him ."
that ' s all .
Emma could hardly understand him ; he seemed in an odd humour .
This was the knowledge of herself , on the first question of inquiry , which she reached ; and without being long in reaching it .-- She was most sorrowfully indignant ; ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed to her -- her affection for Mr .
-- and " Dear Miss Woodhouse ," was all that Harriet , with many tender embraces could articulate at first ; but when they did arrive at something more like conversation , it was sufficiently clear to her friend that she saw , felt , anticipated , and remembered just as she ought .
I am really tired of exploring so long on one spot .
She was good enough for Mr . Elton , no doubt ; accomplished enough for Highbury -- handsome enough -- to look plain , probably , by Harriet ' s side .
" These are the sights , Harriet , to do one good .
Dear Miss Woodhouse , do advise me ."
She was very feverish and had a bad sore throat : Mrs . Goddard was full of care and affection , Mr . Perry was talked of , and Harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement , though she could not speak of her loss without many tears .
" Only think of our happening to meet him !-- How very odd !
" These are the sights , Harriet , to do one good .
WINDSOR - JULY .
" I declare , I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction !-- It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax , who plays so delightfully , should not have an instrument .
To you , he will talk of farming ; to me , of drawing or music ; and so on to every body , having that general information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead , or take the lead , just as propriety may require , and to speak extremely well on each ; that is my idea of him ."
" Yes , indeed , a very good letter ," replied Emma rather slowly --" so good a letter , Harriet , that every thing considered , I think one of his sisters must have helped him .
There is no hurry at all .
He does not read ?"
Here am I come down for only one day , and you are engaged with a dinner - party !-- When did it happen before , or any thing like it ?
At present , there was nothing to be done for Harriet ; good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible on Emma ' s side .
They were rapidly forming words for each other , or for any body else who would be puzzled .
I am sure you did not much expect to like us .
" He ought to come ," said Emma .
Such events are very interesting , but the suspense of them cannot last long .
She had previously determined how far she would proceed , on any application of the sort ; and it would be safer for both , to have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed .-- She was decided , and thus spoke --
The extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or other ."
Her views of improving her little friend ' s mind , by a great deal of useful reading and conversation , had never yet led to more than a few first chapters , and the intention of going on to - morrow .
Wickedness is always wickedness , but folly is not always folly .-- It depends upon the character of those who handle it .
" And I assure you , Mr . Weston , I have very little doubt that my opinion will be decidedly in his favour .
Emma ' s attempts to stop her father had been vain ; and when he had reached such a point as this , she could not wonder at her brother - in - law ' s breaking out .
" My dear Isabella ,"-- exclaimed he hastily --" pray do not concern yourself about my looks .
" Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming , Miss Woodhouse .-- I quite rave about Jane Fairfax .-- A sweet , interesting creature .
Not that she _wanted_ him to marry .
She continued to look back , but in vain ; and soon , with what appeared unusual speed , they were half way down the hill , and every thing left far behind .
I know it has .
We shall soon overtake her .
Say ` No ,' if it is to be said ."
She was just as determined when the morrow came , and went early , that nothing might prevent her .
