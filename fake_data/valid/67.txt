Mr . Knightley , I wish you had the benefit of this ; I think this would convince you .
" Poor comfort !"
I am sure Miss Nash would -- for Miss Nash thinks her own sister very well married , and it is only a linen - draper ."
Such an end of the doleful disappointment of five weeks back !
She was not thoroughly comfortable herself .
" You are a very warm friend to Mr . Martin ; but , as I said before , are unjust to Harriet .
What will it answer ?
Tell me how Miss Fairfax is ."
And , my dear , whenever he comes , you had better let him look at little Bella ' s throat ."
What is the foolish girl about ?"
But now , she would rather it had not happened .
" No ," said Emma , laughing ; " but perhaps there might be some made to his coming back again .
" Such a home , indeed !
Mrs . Weston was disengaged and Emma began again --" Mr . Frank Churchill writes one of the best gentleman ' s hands I ever saw ."
The horror of being blocked up at Randalls , while her children were at Hartfield , was full in her imagination ; and fancying the road to be now just passable for adventurous people , but in a state that admitted no delay , she was eager to have it settled , that her father and Emma should remain at Randalls , while she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them .
When they had been all walking together , he had so often come and walked by her , and talked so very delightfully !-- He seemed to want to be acquainted with her .
She then broke the lace off short , and dexterously throwing it into a ditch , was presently obliged to entreat them to stop , and acknowledged her inability to put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort .
He ought to have opposed the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father .
Emma ' s attempts to stop her father had been vain ; and when he had reached such a point as this , she could not wonder at her brother - in - law ' s breaking out .
When she looked at the hedges , she thought the elder at least must soon be coming out ; and when she turned round to Harriet , she saw something like a look of spring , a tender smile even there .
Mrs . Weston , capital in her country - dances , was seated , and beginning an irresistible waltz ; and Frank Churchill , coming up with most becoming gallantry to Emma , had secured her hand , and led her up to the top .
" You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs . Weston for my feelings ," said Emma ; " were you to guess her to be _eighteen_ , I should listen with pleasure ; but _she_ would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words .
I am sure of having their opinions with me ."
She must be collected and calm .
Poor Miss Bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated , in spite of the very natural wish of a little change ."
She allowed him to talk , and arranged the glasses , and wrapped herself up , without opening her lips .
I will answer for it _she_ never betrayed the least thing in the world .
" I am not at all surprized at you , Harriet .
" Ah !
He did not believe it to proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove , or at least that she might not have many years of existence before her ; but he could not be prevailed on , by all his father ' s doubts , to say that her complaints were merely imaginary , or that she was as strong as ever .
Emma continued to entertain no doubt of her being in love .
In this walk Emma and Mr . Weston found all the others assembled ; and towards this view she immediately perceived Mr . Knightley and Harriet distinct from the rest , quietly leading the way .
Mr . Knightley grew angry .
I am sure they will bring him soon ."
There will be but one subject throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury ; but one interest -- one object of curiosity ; it will be all Mr . Frank Churchill ; we shall think and speak of nobody else ."
" Well done , Mrs .
Dear me , how clever !-- Could it really be meant for me ?"
He owed it to her , to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome interference , rather than her welfare ; to encounter any thing , rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause .
I think her the very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have .
They were all disengaged and all happy .-- The preparatory interest of this dinner , however , was not yet over .
Come on a donkey , however , if you prefer it .
They shew her to the greatest advantage .
She had been thinking of him the moment before , as unquestionably sixteen miles distant .-- There was time only for the quickest arrangement of mind .
Seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment , and every body had a burst of admiration on first arriving ; but in the general amount of the day there was deficiency .
" Thank you .
The happiness of this most happy day , received its completion , in the animated contemplation of his worth which this comparison produced .
Miss Fairfax , you must not run such risks .-- Liable as you have been to severe colds , indeed you ought to be particularly careful , especially at this time of year .
" I am glad you approve of what I have done ," said he very comfortably .
no -- there is nothing to surprize one at all .-- A pretty fortune ; and she came in his way ."
Mr . Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea ; and when he had drank his tea he was quite ready to go home ; and it was as much as his three companions could do , to entertain away his notice of the lateness of the hour , before the other gentlemen appeared .
Miss Woodhouse , how kind you are !-- I suppose you have heard -- and are come to give us joy .
" Oh , dear ," cried Harriet , " now I recollect what you mean ; but I was thinking of something very different at the time .
" You have , I believe , and know the whole ."
We have nothing clever to say -- not one of us .
To walk by the side of this child , and talk to and question her , was the most natural thing in the world , or would have been the most natural , had she been acting just then without design ; and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead , without any obligation of waiting for her .
We are both prejudiced ; you against , I for him ; and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here ."
And he , the very handsomest man that ever was , and a man that every body looks up to , quite like Mr . Knightley !
And , my dear , whenever he comes , you had better let him look at little Bella ' s throat ."
said she .
Used only to a large house himself , and without ever thinking how many advantages and accommodations were attached to its size , he could be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one .
I had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name , which I was not at all pleased with .
" No , to be sure you could not ; but I never thought of that before .
The next question was --
And poor John ' s son came to talk to Mr . Elton about relief from the parish ; he is very well to do himself , you know , being head man at the Crown , ostler , and every thing of that sort , but still he cannot keep his father without some help ; and so , when Mr . Elton came back , he told us what John ostler had been telling him , and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to Randalls to take Mr . Frank Churchill to Richmond .
Six years hence , if he could meet with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own , with a little money , it might be very desirable ."
My charge would be much more concise than her ' s , and probably not much in the same spirit ; all that I have to recommend being comprised in , do not spoil them , and do not physic them ."
One does not , you know , after a time .
" Well ," said he , in a deliberating manner , " for five minutes , perhaps ."
This was the occurrence :-- The Coles had been settled some years in Highbury , and were very good sort of people -- friendly , liberal , and unpretending ; but , on the other hand , they were of low origin , in trade , and only moderately genteel .
I thought it very well done of him indeed .
It is the very last thing I would stand the brunt of just now .
I am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head .
" Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced .
While he spoke , Emma ' s mind was most busy , and , with all the wonderful velocity of thought , had been able -- and yet without losing a word -- to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole ; to see that Harriet ' s hopes had been entirely groundless , a mistake , a delusion , as complete a delusion as any of her own -- that Harriet was nothing ; that she was every thing herself ; that what she had been saying relative to Harriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings ; and that her agitation , her doubts , her reluctance , her discouragement , had been all received as discouragement from herself .-- And not only was there time for these convictions , with all their glow of attendant happiness ; there was time also to rejoice that Harriet ' s secret had not escaped her , and to resolve that it need not , and should not .-- It was all the service she could now render her poor friend ; for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection from herself to Harriet , as infinitely the most worthy of the two -- or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever , without vouchsafing any motive , because he could not marry them both , Emma had it not .
" Ah !
And how could it be supposed that his uncle and aunt would spare him again ?'
I have not always known their writing apart ."
That young man ( speaking lower ) is very thoughtless .
" Mr . Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself ," said she .
my sins , my sins !-- And I had plenty all the while in my pocket !-- One of my senseless tricks !-- I deserve to be under a continual blush all the rest of my life .-- Well --( sitting down again )-- go on -- what else ?"
Till you chose to turn her into a friend , her mind had no distaste for her own set , nor any ambition beyond it .
_Miss_ _Woodhouse_ appeared more than once , and never without a something of pleasing connexion , either a compliment to her taste , or a remembrance of what she had said ; and in the very last time of its meeting her eye , unadorned as it was by any such broad wreath of gallantry , she yet could discern the effect of her influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all conveyed .
" Oh !
He came to the Abbey two evenings ago , on purpose to consult me about it .
She is always so attentive to them !"
" A very pretty trick you have been playing me , upon my word !
" Did you see her often at Weymouth ?
" But still , you will be an old maid !
I dare say , Miss Fairfax , that he either gave his friend very minute directions , or wrote to Broadwood himself .
" Especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful , troublesome creature !"
I cannot at all consent to Mr . Knightley ' s marrying ; and I am sure it is not at all likely .
She doubted whether she had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman , in betraying her suspicions of Jane Fairfax ' s feelings to Frank Churchill .
I do not believe I did you any good .
He began -- stopping , however , almost directly to say , " Had I been offered the sight of one of this gentleman ' s letters to his mother - in - law a few months ago , Emma , it would not have been taken with such indifference ."
How well you put it on !-- so gratified !
said I , ` it is Miss Woodhouse : I am sure you will like to see her .'
` Oh !'
It is impossible to express our surprize .
I think he is just the person to do it , even without being in love ."
The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose any body to .
