No -- till Cole alluded to my supposed attachment , it had never entered my head .
Emma knew this was too true for contradiction , and therefore said nothing .
" Your gallantry is really unanswerable .
and yet , she could not help rather anticipating something decisive .
She was the first to announce it to Mr . Knightley ; and exclaimed quite as much as was necessary , ( or , being acting a part , perhaps rather more ,) at the conduct of the Churchills , in keeping him away .
" I do not say it is so ; but you will do well to consider whether it is so or not , and to regulate your behaviour accordingly .
Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs . Elton , though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her .
I think you play quite as well as she does .
" I was not quite impartial in my judgment , Emma :-- but yet , I think -- had _you_ not been in the case -- I should still have distrusted him ."
Sometimes Mr . Elton predominated , sometimes the Martins ; and each was occasionally useful as a check to the other .
If you do not call early it will be a slight ."
I am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head .
Such a friend as Mrs . Weston was out of the question .
" Is not this most vexations , Knightley ?"
She thought it would be an excellent match ; and only too palpably desirable , natural , and probable , for her to have much merit in planning it .
" I cannot rate her beauty as you do ," said he ; " but she is a pretty little creature , and I am inclined to think very well of her disposition .
Then turning to Isabella , who had not been attending before --" You must know , my dear Mrs . Knightley , that we are by no means so sure of seeing Mr . Frank Churchill , in my opinion , as his father thinks .
Of all the sources of evil surrounding the former , since her coming to Highbury , she was persuaded that she must herself have been the worst .
" Oh !
And how tired you must be after your journey !
Nobody else would come so early .'
Being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling , I have been in no hurry with my congratulations ; but I hope it all went off tolerably well .
" Just as it should be ," said Mr . John Knightley , " and just as I hoped it was from your letters .
He had made his fortune , bought his house , and obtained his wife ; and was beginning a new period of existence , with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through .
But soon it came to be on one side ,
They had stopped at Mrs . Bates ' s door to offer the use of their carriage , but the aunt and niece were to be brought by the Eltons .
" And how could _she_ bear such behaviour !
Oh no !
" Very true ," he gravely replied ; " it was very bad ."
Martin !"
" Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother and sister are here .
the pains I have been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him cheerfuller views !
Mr . Knightley ' s excessive curiosity to know what this word might be , made him seize every possible moment for darting his eye towards it , and it was not long before he saw it to be _Dixon_ .
CHAPTER IV
I am not like Jane ; I wish I were .
I do suspect he would not have had a pair of horses for himself , and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them ."
Emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced Mr . Dixon ' s actions from his wife , or of any thing mischievous which her imagination had suggested at first .
yes , and I shall be very happy in his acquaintance .
I wanted them to put off the wedding ."
Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr . Elton ' s having dropt a hint .
" Most favourably for his nephew -- gave his consent with scarcely a difficulty .
Emma guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney , and too stupid to rise .
You will soon , I earnestly hope , know her thoroughly yourself .-- No description can describe her .
We had great amusement with those letters one morning .
Emma had not another word to oppose .
She believed he was very clever , and understood every thing .
Do you know any family of that name ?"
I am sure of your kind support and aid ."
Emma ' s going away directly after tea might be giving offence .
" Oh yes , sir ," cried she with ready sympathy , " how you must miss her !
Now , however , I see nothing in it but a very natural and consistent degree of discretion .
" He wrote a letter to poor Mrs . Weston , to congratulate her , and a very proper , handsome letter it was .
And then , her reserve -- I never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved ."
" What an amiable creature I was !-- No wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance ."
In this state Frank Churchill had found her , she trembling and conditioning , they loud and insolent .
I dare say she did not understand me ."
If this is living in the country , it is nothing very formidable .
Within a fortnight .
He may be sure of every woman ' s approbation while he writes with such gallantry ."
It did appear -- there was no concealing it -- exactly like the pretence of being in love with her , instead of Harriet ; an inconstancy , if real , the most contemptible and abominable !
Dixon in them ."
It was a long , well - written letter , giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings , expressing all the affection , gratitude , and respect which was natural and honourable , and describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed attractive , with spirit and precision .
" Oh !
" Aye , very true , my dear ," cried the latter , though Jane had not spoken a word --" I was just going to say the same thing .
" This was really his ," said Harriet .--" Do not you remember one morning ?-- no , I dare say you do not .
` My dear ,' said I , ` you will blind yourself '-- for tears were in her eyes perpetually .
Not to wait upon a bride is very remiss .
I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can , I must walk somewhere , and the post - office is an object ; and upon my word , I have scarcely ever had a bad morning before ."
Ambition , as well as love , had probably been mortified .
But you will do every thing right .
She was sensible of all the affection it evinced .
The very day of Mr . Elton ' s going to London produced a fresh occasion for Emma ' s services towards her friend .
She was pleased , on taking leave , to find Miss Fairfax determined to attend her out of the room , to go with her even downstairs ; it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of , to say ,
I do not care for myself .
After these came a second set ; among the most come - at - able of whom were Mrs . and Miss Bates , and Mrs . Goddard , three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield , and who were fetched and carried home so often , that Mr . Woodhouse thought it no hardship for either James or the horses .
And he smiled with such seeming pleasure at the conviction , that she must proceed another step .
I never could comprehend how Mr . Weston could part with him .
They might be more safely held up as a pattern .
said Emma , recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided between wonder and amusement .
I am afraid you must have had a shocking walk ."
said Mr . Woodhouse , shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her with tender concern .-- The ejaculation in Emma ' s ear expressed , " Ah !
" Yes -- I _have_ called there ; passing the door , I thought it better .
" Such an extraordinary dream of mine !"
She owned that , considering every thing , she was not absolutely without inclination for the party .
Surprizes are foolish things .
" Well , my dear Jane , I believe we must be running away .
I knew it was -- but had not resolution enough to part with them ."
The child of good fortune !
" Nor , if you were , could I ever bear to part with you , my Harriet .
Papa is only speaking his own regret ."
If _she_ had so misinterpreted his feelings , she had little right to wonder that _he_ , with self - interest to blind him , should have mistaken hers .
I understand it was a very handsome letter , indeed .
Harriet really wished , and had wished some time , to consult a dentist .
united , what reverse we have !
The cold , however , was severe ; and by the time the second carriage was in motion , a few flakes of snow were finding their way down , and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time .
Elton ?"
Emma had not another word to oppose .
" Ah !
Mr . Elton ' s engagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting Mr . Martin .
" No -- Mrs . Knightley ;-- and till she is in being , I will manage such matters myself ."
