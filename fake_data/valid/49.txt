Isabella and Emma , I think , do write very much alike .
His mother and sisters were very fond of him .
" Will you read the letter ?"
" Very likely .-- I think they are , without exception , the most vulgar girls in Highbury ."
" Have you any idea of Mr . Knightley ' s returning your affection ?"
if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax !"
She must be collected and calm .
Mrs . Elton eagerly interposed with ,
WINDSOR - JULY .
Miss Woodhouse , what a pity that I must not write this beautiful charade into my book !
Within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge - ware box , which Harriet opened : it was well lined with the softest cotton ; but , excepting the cotton , Emma saw only a small piece of court - plaister .
I should be surprized if , after seeing them , you could be in company with Mr . Martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior creature -- and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before .
I have heard so much in praise of Mr . Frank Churchill .-- At the same time it is fair to observe , that I am one of those who always judge for themselves , and are by no means implicitly guided by others .
It is to be a morning scheme , you know , Knightley ; quite a simple thing .
He had gone away rejected and mortified -- disappointed in a very sanguine hope , after a series of what appeared to him strong encouragement ; and not only losing the right lady , but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one .
How was she to bear the change ?-- It was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them ; but Emma was aware that great must be the difference between a Mrs . Weston , only half a mile from them , and a Miss Taylor in the house ; and with all her advantages , natural and domestic , she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude .
there is one difficulty unprovided for ," cried Emma .
Emma was not required , by any subsequent discovery , to retract her ill opinion of Mrs . Elton .
Yes , indeed , there is every thing in the world that can make her happy in it .
Mr . Woodhouse came in , and very soon led to the subject again , by the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of " Well , my dears , how does your book go on ?-- Have you got any thing fresh ?"
Emma said it would be awkward ; Mrs . Weston was in distress about the supper ; and Mr . Woodhouse opposed it earnestly , on the score of health .
I am exceedingly obliged to you , Mrs . Elton , I am obliged to any body who feels for me , but I am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer .
You and I need not be afraid .
Quite thick shoes .
You cannot mean that he has even proposed to her again -- yet .
Mrs . Elton had undoubtedly the advantage , at this time , in vanity completely gratified ; for though she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill , she could not lose by the change .
Something of that nature would be particularly desirable for _me_ , as an inducement to keep me in practice ; for married women , you know -- there is a sad story against them , in general .
She was now met by Mrs .
Her character depends upon those she is with ; but in good hands she will turn out a valuable woman ."
Man ' s boasted power and freedom , all are flown .
Will not the old prejudice be too strong ?"
" My dear papa , he is three - and - twenty .
But you will do every thing right .
You would have doated on her , had you gone .-- But not a word more .
I shall talk about it to him ; he will settle for me ; he will help me out of all my difficulties .'
Elton .-- She looked round for a moment ; he had joined Mr . Knightley at a little distance , and was arranging himself for settled conversation , while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife .
She had no objection .
With the view of passing off an awkward moment , Emma smilingly said ,
Emma ' s first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge of what had passed ,-- aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion : but she soon felt that concealment must be impossible .
She then took a longer time for consideration .
She suspected that it _had_ ; that it would not have been so resolutely encountered but in full expectation of hearing from some one very dear , and that it had not been in vain .
He gave her a letter , it was from Frank , and to herself ; he had met with it in his way , and had taken the liberty of opening it .
He began -- stopping , however , almost directly to say , " Had I been offered the sight of one of this gentleman ' s letters to his mother - in - law a few months ago , Emma , it would not have been taken with such indifference ."
" Well ," said she to herself , " this is most strange !-- After I had got him off so well , to chuse to go into company , and leave Harriet ill behind !-- Most strange indeed !-- But there is , I believe , in many men , especially single men , such an inclination -- such a passion for dining out -- a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures , their employments , their dignities , almost their duties , that any thing gives way to it -- and this must be the case with Mr . Elton ; a most valuable , amiable , pleasing young man undoubtedly , and very much in love with Harriet ; but still , he cannot refuse an invitation , he must dine out wherever he is asked .
She went -- she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door , but had not been into the house since the morning after Box Hill , when poor Jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion , though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected .-- The fear of being still unwelcome , determined her , though assured of their being at home , to wait in the passage , and send up her name .-- She heard Patty announcing it ; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had before made so happily intelligible .-- No ; she heard nothing but the instant reply of , " Beg her to walk up ;"-- and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself , coming eagerly forward , as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient .-- Emma had never seen her look so well , so lovely , so engaging .
Let me entreat you , Miss Woodhouse , to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend .
but why so ?-- I can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you , should not please and amuse me too ."
" I am disappointed ," was his only answer .
I was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying to Mrs . Elton , and when Mrs . Elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it !
But there was no doing any thing , with Mr . Elton fidgeting behind her and watching every touch .
That there was to be such a party had been long generally known : it had even given the idea of another .
Your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name your own terms , have as many rooms as you like , and mix in the family as much as you chose ;-- that is -- I do not know -- if you knew the harp , you might do all that , I am very sure ; but you sing as well as play ;-- yes , I really believe you might , even without the harp , stipulate for what you chose ;-- and you must and shall be delightfully , honourably and comfortably settled before the Campbells or I have any rest ."
And now , poor girl !
Mr . Churchill , independent of his wife , was feared by nobody ; an easy , guidable man , to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew .
or a shark ?
" I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly ; oftener than I should suppose such a circumstance would , in the common course of things , occur to him ."
She was a plain , motherly kind of woman , who had worked hard in her youth , and now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a tea - visit ; and having formerly owed much to Mr . Woodhouse ' s kindness , felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat parlour , hung round with fancy - work , whenever she could , and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside .
Do put up your horse at the Crown , and come in ."
Her affection must have overpowered her judgment ."
She was very fond of singing .
" My dear papa , I sent the whole hind - quarter .
and " John , how are you ?"
An injunction of secresy had been among Mr . Weston ' s parting words .
I went for only one night , and could not get away till that very day se ' nnight ."
the good Bateses -- I am quite ashamed of myself -- but you mention them in most of your letters .
At the same time , nobody could wonder if Mr . Elton should have aspired -- Miss Woodhouse lets me chatter on , so good - humouredly .
Forcing herself to speak , therefore , in the hope of putting it by , she calmly said ,
" My dear Harriet , you must not refine too much upon this charade .-- You will betray your feelings improperly , if you are too conscious and too quick , and appear to affix more meaning , or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it .
there he is .
Emma was most sincerely interested .
It makes me envious and miserable ;-- I who have never seen it !
Elton !-- The stain of illegitimacy , unbleached by nobility or wealth , would have been a stain indeed .
" There were misunderstandings between them , Emma ; he said so expressly .
" Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning ?-- Do , if it be possible .
" It will be natural for me ," he added shortly afterwards , " to speak my opinion aloud as I read .
I managed it extremely well ."
CHAPTER II
Mrs . Weston , your argument weighs most with me .
Poor man !-- it was at first a considerable shock to him , and he tried earnestly to dissuade her from it .
I am very sure you did me good .
You and Miss Fairfax gave us some very good music .
" Worse than I had supposed .
You have scolded me too much for match - making , for me to presume to take such a liberty with you .
Mrs . Smallridge , a most delightful woman !-- A style of living almost equal to Maple Grove -- and as to the children , except the little Sucklings and little Bragges , there are not such elegant sweet children anywhere .
One has not great hopes from Birmingham .
But I am quite in the minority , I believe ; few people seem to value simplicity of dress ,-- show and finery are every thing .
" So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax ?"
She had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from her heart , for he stopped to hand her out .
Mr . Knightley , who , for some reason best known to himself , had certainly taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill , was only growing to dislike him more .
This , you know , speaks a great degree of weakness -- but now she is so impatient to be in town , that she means to sleep only two nights on the road .-- So Frank writes word .
But for that reason , I should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females , for boys have very little teaching after an early age , and scramble into any hand they can get .
" I have escaped ; and that I should escape , may be a matter of grateful wonder to you and myself .
Mr . Knightley had been telling him something about brewing spruce - beer , and he wanted to put it down ; but when he took out his pencil , there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away , and it would not do , so you lent him another , and this was left upon the table as good for nothing .
" Upon my word , Emma , to hear you abusing the reason you have , is almost enough to make me think so too .
She inherits her mother ' s talents , and must have been under subjection to her ."
You have been no friend to Harriet Smith , Emma .
CHAPTER XVI
I see nobody else looking like her !-- I must go and ask her whether it is an Irish fashion .
I have a very sincere interest in Emma .
The stupidest fellow !
