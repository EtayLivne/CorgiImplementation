I shall be at home in twenty minutes ."
The result of this distress was , that , with a much more voluntary , cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the moment , she was able to fix her wedding - day -- and Mr . Elton was called on , within a month from the marriage of Mr . and Mrs . Robert Martin , to join the hands of Mr . Knightley and Miss Woodhouse .
We hear of him for ever at some watering - place or other .
" Ought to refuse him !
Something of that nature would be particularly desirable for _me_ , as an inducement to keep me in practice ; for married women , you know -- there is a sad story against them , in general .
One accompaniment to her song took her agreeably by surprize -- a second , slightly but correctly taken by Frank Churchill .
I am sorry for it .
How will a conundrum reckon ?"
I have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad .
There will be enough for every hope and every fear ; and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent , it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder .
With a faint blush , she presently replied ,
She must allow him to be still frequently coming to look ; any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover ; and he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil , to jump up and see the progress , and be charmed .-- There was no being displeased with such an encourager , for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost before it was possible .
MY DEAR MADAM ,
How can she find any appellation for them , deep enough in familiar vulgarity ?
Her curiosity was greatly excited .
He was a married man , with only one living child , a girl , about Jane ' s age : and Jane became their guest , paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all ; and before she was nine years old , his daughter ' s great fondness for her , and his own wish of being a real friend , united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her education .
" Oh !"
She had hoped for an answer here -- for a few words to say that her conduct was at least intelligible ; but he was silent ; and , as far as she could judge , deep in thought .
" But they like it , papa ; there is nothing they like so much .
One cannot love a reserved person ."
I think they judge wisely .
She felt immediately that she should like him ; and there was a well - bred ease of manner , and a readiness to talk , which convinced her that he came intending to be acquainted with her , and that acquainted they soon must be .
All that were good would be withdrawn ; and if to these losses , the loss of Donwell were to be added , what would remain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach ?
Emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about Mr . Frank Churchill ' s not coming , except as a disappointment at Randalls .
" Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning ?-- Do , if it be possible .
You will all be going soon I suppose ; the whole party breaking up .
Here ceased the concert part of the evening , for Miss Woodhouse and Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers ; but soon ( within five minutes ) the proposal of dancing -- originating nobody exactly knew where -- was so effectually promoted by Mr . and Mrs . Cole , that every thing was rapidly clearing away , to give proper space .
" My Emma !"
But at present there was nothing more to be said .
Thank ye , the gloves do very well -- only a little too large about the wrist ; but Jane is taking them in ."
Mr . and Mrs . John Knightley were to come down in August , and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back .
I am making a conundrum .
Knightley .--" Emma , that I fear is a word -- No , I have no wish -- Stay , yes , why should I hesitate ?-- I have gone too far already for concealment .-- Emma , I accept your offer -- Extraordinary as it may seem , I accept it , and refer myself to you as a friend .-- Tell me , then , have I no chance of ever succeeding ?"
But I must be more in want of a friend , or an agreeable companion , than I have yet been , to take the trouble of conquering any body ' s reserve to procure one .
" Yes ; if you and Mr . Woodhouse see no objection , and I trust you cannot , my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there .
returned Mr . Knightley , with energy .
Does not she , Jane ?-- Do not we often talk of Mr . Frank Churchill ?-- Ah !
I thought -- but I beg your pardon , perhaps I have been under a mistake .
I , being a husband , and you not being a wife , the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force .
Some of the objects of his curiosity spoke very amiable feelings .
You will be adored in Highbury .
Emma , in good spirits too , from the amusement afforded her mind by the expectation of Mr . Frank Churchill , was willing to forget his late improprieties , and be as well satisfied with him as before , and on his making Harriet his very first subject , was ready to listen with most friendly smiles .
She wished him to speak , but he would not .
Mrs . Weston added , " that he could only allow himself time to hurry to Highbury , after breakfast , and take leave of the few friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him ; and that he might be expected at Hartfield very soon ."
When the Westons arrived , the kindest looks of love , the strongest of admiration were for her , from both husband and wife ; the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object , and at dinner she found him seated by her -- and , as she firmly believed , not without some dexterity on his side .
And I think she feels it .
He could sing a little himself .
All the better .
" I had a few lines on parish business from Mr . Weston this morning , and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened ."
It is a mere nothing after all ; and not the least draught from the stairs ."
" If he could stay only a couple of days , he ought to come ; and one can hardly conceive a young man ' s not having it in his power to do as much as that .
cried Jane , with a blush and an hesitation which Emma thought infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual composure --" there would have been no danger .
" I merely asked , whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax and her party at Weymouth ."
And as for James , you may be very sure he will always like going to Randalls , because of his daughter ' s being housemaid there .
I can imagine , that before she had seen any body superior , she might tolerate him .
What am I to do ?"
A little upstart , vulgar being , with her Mr . E ., and her _caro_ _sposo_ , and her resources , and all her airs of pert pretension and underbred finery .
I speak as a friend , Emma .
" He chose to say he was employed "--
" The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me .
Smallridge , too !
His manners , however , must have been unmarked , wavering , dubious , or she could not have been so misled .
" What a precious deposit !"
" You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before ."
Only three of us .-- besides dear Jane at present -- and she really eats nothing -- makes such a shocking breakfast , you would be quite frightened if you saw it .
" No , indeed I do not ."
She will break it to you better than I can .
" I am disappointed ," was his only answer .
When you are tired of eating strawberries in the garden , there shall be cold meat in the house ."
Harriet had not surmised her own danger , but the idea of it struck her forcibly .
And I hate Italian singing .-- There is no understanding a word of it .
" I went only to the post - office ," said she , " and reached home before the rain was much .
That nature had given it in feature could not be unseen by the young woman , nor could her higher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents .
They might advance rapidly if they would , however ; they must advance somehow or other whether they would or no .
I shall speak to Mr . E . The man who fetches our letters every morning ( one of our men , I forget his name ) shall inquire for yours too and bring them to you .
if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax !"
I cannot keep my eyes from it .
" No ," cried Mr . Knightley , " that need not be the consequence .
" She thinks herself wrong , then , for having consented to a private engagement ?"
" Knightley !"
" Not at all ," cried he ; " I am much obliged to you for it .
Harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since those two decisive dances .-- Emma knew that he had , on that occasion , found her much superior to his expectation .
` My dear ,' said I , ` I shall say you are laid down upon the bed :' but , however , she is not ; she is walking about the room .
One is sick of the very name of Jane Fairfax .
He has those to please who must be pleased , and who ( between ourselves ) are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices .
One natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in ," she said , " was that of making her _unreasonable_ .
their luxury and ease .
" But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so soon , though he does .
Do you think it will look well ?"
She could only give him a look ; but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses , and then left the sofa , removing to a seat by her sister , and giving her all her attention .
" There might be scruples of delicacy , my dear Emma .
After a little more discourse in praise of gruel , with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every body , he proceeded to say , with an air of grave reflection ,
It must , if I were not here .
I never saw any thing equal to the comfort and style -- Candles everywhere .-- I was telling you of your grandmama , Jane ,-- There was a little disappointment .-- The baked apples and biscuits , excellent in their way , you know ; but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first , and good Mr . Woodhouse , not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough , sent it all out again .
Emma was obliged to fancy what she liked -- but she could never believe that in the same situation _she_ should not have discovered the truth .
Mr . Weston is rather an easy , cheerful - tempered man , than a man of strong feelings ; he takes things as he finds them , and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other , depending , I suspect , much more upon what is called society for his comforts , that is , upon the power of eating and drinking , and playing whist with his neighbours five times a week , than upon family affection , or any thing that home affords ."
" My dear Miss Woodhouse , a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act .
Observe her eyes , as she is looking up at my father .-- You will be glad to hear ( inclining his head , and whispering seriously ) that my uncle means to give her all my aunt ' s jewels .
A charming place , undoubtedly .
It would not have been the awkwardness of a moment , it would have been rather a pleasure , previous to the suspicions of this very day ; she could have talked to him of Harriet , and the three - quarters of a mile would have seemed but one .
