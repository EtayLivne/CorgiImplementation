" I wonder he did not remember the book "-- was all Harriet ' s answer , and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be safely left to itself .
Oh !
His air and voice recovered their usual briskness : he shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand , and entered on the subject in a manner to prove , that he now only wanted time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing .
They had sung together once or twice , it appeared , at Weymouth .
Dixon is very musical , is he ?
The manner , perhaps , may have as little to recommend them .
how so ?
I dare say he has ; and though it may cut him off from some advantages , it will secure him many others ."
The list she drew up when only fourteen -- I remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit , that I preserved it some time ; and I dare say she may have made out a very good list now .
Miss Bates , in her real anxiety for Jane , could hardly stay even to be grateful , before she stept forward and put an end to all farther singing .
They will be so near their own stable ."
This letter must make its way to Emma ' s feelings .
He might be superseded by another ; he certainly would indeed ; nothing could be clearer ; even a Robert Martin would have been sufficient ; but nothing else , she feared , would cure her .
I should like to see Emma in love , and in some doubt of a return ; it would do her good .
She wanted , rather , to be quiet , and out of temptation ; but still , as it was desirable that she should appear , in general , like her usual self , she took care to express as much interest in the circumstance , and enter as warmly into Mr . and Mrs . Weston ' s disappointment , as might naturally belong to their friendship .
Mrs . Weston was disengaged and Emma began again --" Mr . Frank Churchill writes one of the best gentleman ' s hands I ever saw ."
I am delighted to find that you can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander -- but it will not do -- very sorry to check you in your first essay -- but indeed it will not do .
A little curiosity Emma had ; and she made the most of it while her friend related .
A mind like hers , once opening to suspicion , made rapid progress .
There was instant pleasure in the sight of them , and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound -- for Mr . Weston immediately accosted her with ,
I can imagine , that before she had seen any body superior , she might tolerate him .
Jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour , and they had only accomplished some views of St . Mark ' s Place , Venice , when Frank Churchill entered the room .
Goldsmith tells us , that when lovely woman stoops to folly , she has nothing to do but to die ; and when she stoops to be disagreeable , it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill - fame .
He did not boast , but it naturally betrayed itself , that he had persuaded his aunt where his uncle could do nothing , and on her laughing and noticing it , he owned that he believed ( excepting one or two points ) he could _with_ _time_ persuade her to any thing .
It is such a happiness when good people get together -- and they always do .
" He had just looked into the dining - room , and as he was not wanted there , preferred being out of doors ."
Mr . Perry has been with her , as you probably heard ."
" There is so pointed , and so particular a meaning in this compliment ," said she , " that I cannot have a doubt as to Mr . Elton ' s intentions .
Emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech , from his wife .
where shall we sit ?
I leave you to your own reflections ."
It spoke such perfect amity .-- He left them immediately afterwards -- gone in a moment .
But first of all , there must be an answer written to Mrs .
Selina says it is quite horror to her -- and I believe I have caught a little of her nicety .
If Colonel Campbell is not the person , who can be ?"
Mrs . Goddard ' s school was in high repute -- and very deservedly ; for Highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot : she had an ample house and garden , gave the children plenty of wholesome food , let them run about a great deal in the summer , and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands .
Come , sir , pray let me hear it ."
She had frequently thought -- especially since his father ' s marriage with Miss Taylor -- that if she _were_ to marry , he was the very person to suit her in age , character and condition .
Bless me !
She was pleased , on taking leave , to find Miss Fairfax determined to attend her out of the room , to go with her even downstairs ; it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of , to say ,
You could make it into two parcels , Mrs . Ford , could not you ?"
But the sight of Mr . Knightley among the most attentive , soon drew away half Emma ' s mind ; and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of Mrs . Weston ' s suspicions , to which the sweet sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions .
" I often feel concern ," said she , " that I dare not make our carriage more useful on such occasions .
Their propriety , simplicity , and elegance , would make them the safest model for any young woman ."
" Very bad -- though it might have been worse .-- Playing a most dangerous game .
" I have to thank you , Miss Woodhouse , for a very kind forgiving message in one of Mrs . Weston ' s letters .
He praised her for being without art or affectation , for having simple , honest , generous , feelings .-- She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet ; he had dwelt on them to her more than once .-- Much that lived in Harriet ' s memory , many little particulars of the notice she had received from him , a look , a speech , a removal from one chair to another , a compliment implied , a preference inferred , had been unnoticed , because unsuspected , by Emma .
How they were all to be conveyed , he would have made a difficulty if he could , but as his son and daughter ' s carriage and horses were actually at Hartfield , he was not able to make more than a simple question on that head ; it hardly amounted to a doubt ; nor did it occupy Emma long to convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for Harriet also .
I hope you find a chair .
Most cordially , when Miss Bates arrived , did she agree that it must .
There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are .
It was settled that they should go to Box Hill .
He must have a pretty good opinion of himself ."
Much , much beyond impropriety !-- It has sunk him , I cannot say how it has sunk him in my opinion .
I am always watching her to admire ; and I do pity her from my heart ."
" Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon ?"
" This is coming as you should do ," said she ; " like a gentleman .-- I am quite glad to see you ."
CHAPTER XVI
You are so kind !"
Mr . Frank Churchill , I must tell you my mother ' s spectacles have never been in fault since ; the rivet never came out again .
I am a talker , you know ; I am rather a talker ; and now and then I have let a thing escape me which I should not .
With the view of passing off an awkward moment , Emma smilingly said ,
--" She believed he was reckoned a very fine young man ."
" I am afraid Jane is not very well ," said she , " but I do not know ; they _tell_ me she is well .
" You mistake me , you quite mistake me ," she replied , exerting herself .
And so excellent in the Church !
I leave you to your own reflections ."
It might be safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity and beauty , its rich pastures , spreading flocks , orchard in blossom , and light column of smoke ascending .-- She joined them at the wall , and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around .
" There , papa !-- Now you must be satisfied -- Our own dear Mrs . Weston , who is carefulness itself .
There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are .
" Then pray stay at Richmond ."
He was on foot , and after looking very respectfully at her , looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion .
But do come in .
you amuse me excessively .
Selina says it is quite horror to her -- and I believe I have caught a little of her nicety .
" My dear Jane , say no more about it .
Donwell and Randalls had received their invitation , and none had come for her father and herself ; and Mrs . Weston ' s accounting for it with " I suppose they will not take the liberty with you ; they know you do not dine out ," was not quite sufficient .
" I have not been working uninterruptedly ," he replied , " I have been assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily , it was not quite firm ; an unevenness in the floor , I believe .
CHAPTER I
Disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him at every turn .
Mr . Knightley was thoughtful again .
The happiness of Miss Smith was quite equal to her intentions .
Emma was not thinking of it at the moment , which made the information she received more valuable .
A fine place , but very retired ."
He is an excellent young man , both as son and brother .
I shall never forget his flying Henry ' s kite for him that very windy day last Easter -- and ever since his particular kindness last September twelvemonth in writing that note , at twelve o ' clock at night , on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham , I have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence .-- If any body can deserve him , it must be Miss Taylor ."
This discovery laid many smaller matters open .
You do us a great deal of honour to - day , I am sure .
replied the happily deceived aunt , while eagerly hunting for the letter .--" Oh !
Emma was gratified , to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character , and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance .
He has encouragement enough to proceed , without our sighing out our souls over this charade ."
If he were to be very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now , it might augur something .
How it might be considered by the rest of the party , she could not tell .
Serious she was , very serious in her thankfulness , and in her resolutions ; and yet there was no preventing a laugh , sometimes in the very midst of them .
I heard a good deal of Colonel Campbell ' s taste at Weymouth ; and the softness of the upper notes I am sure is exactly what he and _all_ _that_ _party_ would particularly prize .
It was not with Mrs . Suckling , it was not with Mrs . Bragge , but in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them : it was with a cousin of Mrs . Bragge , an acquaintance of Mrs . Suckling , a lady known at Maple Grove .
This made a difficulty .
I dare not let my mother know how little she eats -- so I say one thing and then I say another , and it passes off .
said Frank Churchill , as soon as they were out of hearing :--" How well they suit one another !-- Very lucky -- marrying as they did , upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place !-- They only knew each other , I think , a few weeks in Bath !
She was a plain , motherly kind of woman , who had worked hard in her youth , and now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a tea - visit ; and having formerly owed much to Mr . Woodhouse ' s kindness , felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat parlour , hung round with fancy - work , whenever she could , and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside .
