It is a most uncommon complexion , with her dark eye - lashes and hair -- a most distinguishing complexion !
You do nothing .
Dixon is very musical , is he ?
When he did return , he sought out the child and took notice of her .
I really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else ."
And I should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to such vanity - baits for poor young ladies ."
With a little reserve of manner , Emma continued :
Jane she had a distinct glimpse of , looking extremely ill ; and , before the door had shut them out , she heard Miss Bates saying , " Well , my dear , I shall _say_ you are laid down upon the bed , and I am sure you are ill enough ."
However , she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago ; which is saying a great deal at my mother ' s time of life -- and it really is full two years , you know , since she was here .
-- What does this mean ?
I told you he was plain ."
If she does wrong , she ought to feel it ."
What right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged , and with manners so _very_ disengaged ?
Do not let me lose it .
You might not give Emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to promise ; but you were receiving a very good education from _her_ , on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will , and doing as you were bid ; and if Weston had asked me to recommend him a wife , I should certainly have named Miss Taylor ."
" Aye , very true , my dear ," cried the latter , though Jane had not spoken a word --" I was just going to say the same thing .
When he was again in their company , he could not help remembering what he had seen ; nor could he avoid observations which , unless it were like Cowper and his fire at twilight ,
here ' s Miss Woodhouse .-- Dear Miss Woodhouse , how do you do ?-- Very well I thank you , quite well .
It was not in his calmness that she read his comparative difference .
Some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they walked into Mrs . Weston ' s drawing - room ;-- Mr . Elton must compose his joyous looks , and Mr . John Knightley disperse his ill - humour .
" That is ," replied Mr . Knightley , " she will indulge her even more than she did you , and believe that she does not indulge her at all .
" You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs . Weston for my feelings ," said Emma ; " were you to guess her to be _eighteen_ , I should listen with pleasure ; but _she_ would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words .
Frank Churchill ' s little inclination to exclude himself increased so much , that his last words to Emma were ,
I saw her as I came in ; she was standing in the entrance .
Elton !-- no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him ."
" She should always send for Perry , if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered , were it only for a moment .
And Elizabeth , too .
" And after all , five couple are not enough to make it worth while to stand up .
" I promise you to make none for myself , papa ; but I must , indeed , for other people .
We really seem quite the fashion .
If I come , I shall be cross ."
She promised him again and again to come -- much oftener than he doubted -- and was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy , such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it .
Harriet listened submissively , and said " it was very true -- it was just as Miss Woodhouse described -- it was not worth while to think about them -- and she would not think about them any longer " but no change of subject could avail , and the next half - hour saw her as anxious and restless about the Eltons as before .
Dixon ?"
If it be not inconvenient to you , pray let us go in , that I may prove myself to belong to the place , to be a true citizen of Highbury .
Mr . Weston would take no denial ; they must all dine at Randalls one day ;-- even Mr . Woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of the party .
She had never rejoiced at the sound before , nor ever before entered the passage , nor walked up the stairs , with any wish of giving pleasure , but in conferring obligation , or of deriving it , except in subsequent ridicule .
Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings , Mr . and Mrs . Weston ' s visit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune .
It ought to be no recommendation to _you_ .
.
I have no doubt of his having , at times , considerable influence ; but it may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand _when_ it will be ."
A thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have ever shewn me , and ten thousand for the attentions your heart will dictate towards her .-- If you think me in a way to be happier than I deserve , I am quite of your opinion .-- Miss W . calls me the child of good fortune .
" Well , Emma , I do not believe I have any thing more to say about the boys ; but you have your sister ' s letter , and every thing is down at full length there we may be sure .
The two other gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass .
With Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again , and for a longer time than hitherto ; of judging of his general manners , and by inference , of the meaning of his manners towards herself ; of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air ; and of fancying what the observations of all those might be , who were now seeing them together for the first time .
" She loves him then excessively , I suppose .
I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction , comfort , and delight to me , to hear what a musical society I am got into .
A bride , you know , my dear , is always the first in company , let the others be who they may ."
" But , unfortunately , sir , my time is so limited --"
I met the letters in my way this morning , and seeing my son ' s hand , presumed to open it -- though it was not directed to me -- it was to Mrs . Weston .
" I had a few lines on parish business from Mr . Weston this morning , and at the end of them he gave me a brief account of what had happened ."
If _she_ had so misinterpreted his feelings , she had little right to wonder that _he_ , with self - interest to blind him , should have mistaken hers .
Smallridge , too !
" Upon my word , Emma ."
` You and I must part .
I was glad you made her play so much , for having no instrument at her grandmother ' s , it must have been a real indulgence ."
Emma did not want to be classed with the Mrs . Eltons , the Mrs . Perrys , and the Mrs . Coles , who would force themselves anywhere ; neither could she feel any right of preference herself -- she submitted , therefore , and only questioned Miss Bates farther as to her niece ' s appetite and diet , which she longed to be able to assist .
Oh !
one can think of nothing else ."
I believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing - room that we are expecting Frank .
` Not that it was such a very old petticoat either -- for still it would last a great while -- and , indeed , she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong .'"
no , no , no -- how can you suspect me of such a thing ?
I certainly have been misunderstanding you , if you feel in doubt as to the _purport_ of your answer .
Mr . Weston directed the whole , officiating safely between Hartfield and the Vicarage , and every body was in good time .
" Are you well , my Emma ?"
" I am here on no business of my own ," said Emma ; " I am only waiting for my friend .
That is your date .
You must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other .
His company so sought after , that every body says he need not eat a single meal by himself if he does not chuse it ; that he has more invitations than there are days in the week .
" We are going to Box Hill to - morrow ;-- you will join us .
She was pondering , in the meanwhile , upon the possibility , without seeming very rude , of making her escape from Jane Fairfax ' s letter , and had almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse , when Miss Bates turned to her again and seized her attention .
But Miss Bates soon came --" Very happy and obliged "-- but Emma ' s conscience told her that there was not the same cheerful volubility as before -- less ease of look and manner .
" She has taken it into her head that Enscombe is too cold for her .
" With all my heart .
I should not have used the expression .
But hush , hush !"
This made a difficulty .
I know what your drawings are .
If she were to meet Miss Bates in her way !-- and upon its beginning to rain , Emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be detaining her at Mrs . Goddard ' s , and that the intelligence would undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation .
No suspicious flourishes now of apology or concern ; it was the language of real feeling towards Mrs . Weston ; and the transition from Highbury to Enscombe , the contrast between the places in some of the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt , and how much more might have been said but for the restraints of propriety .-- The charm of her own name was not wanting .
Harriet listened submissively , and said " it was very true -- it was just as Miss Woodhouse described -- it was not worth while to think about them -- and she would not think about them any longer " but no change of subject could avail , and the next half - hour saw her as anxious and restless about the Eltons as before .
Nothing should tempt _her_ to go , if they did ; and she regretted that her father ' s known habits would be giving her refusal less meaning than she could wish .
When they all sat down it was better ; to her taste a great deal better , for Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay , making her his first object .
The corner of the sofa is very good .
Knightley was at Hartfield yesterday , and spoke of it as for Saturday ."
I perfectly understand your situation , however , Miss Woodhouse -- ( looking towards Mr . Woodhouse ), Your father ' s state of health must be a great drawback .
" You do quite right ," said she ;--" we will make your apologies to Mr . and Mrs .
Oh !
Compliments , charades , and horrible blunders ; and it was not to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be recollecting too ; but she behaved very well , and was only rather pale and silent .
I was a kinder friend than you deserved .
Every thing so good !"
At another time Emma might have been amused , but she was too much astonished now at Mr . Elton ' s spirits for other feelings .
Her father was growing nervous , and could not understand _her_ .
The appearance of the little sitting - room as they entered , was tranquillity itself ; Mrs . Bates , deprived of her usual employment , slumbering on one side of the fire , Frank Churchill , at a table near her , most deedily occupied about her spectacles , and Jane Fairfax , standing with her back to them , intent on her pianoforte .
Richard ?-- Oh !
Of course I have not transcribed beyond the first eight lines ."
She did not always feel so absolutely satisfied with herself , so entirely convinced that her opinions were right and her adversary ' s wrong , as Mr . Knightley .
It was Garrick ' s , you know ."
You might not see one in a hundred with _gentleman_ so plainly written as in Mr . Knightley .
" Are you well , my Emma ?"
