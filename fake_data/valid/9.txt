" Mr . Elton ' s manners are not perfect ," replied Emma ; " but where there is a wish to please , one ought to overlook , and one does overlook a great deal .
Invite them both ."
It will do you good to speak of your distress , whatever it may be ."
By birth she belonged to Highbury : and when at three years old , on losing her mother , she became the property , the charge , the consolation , the fondling of her grandmother and aunt , there had seemed every probability of her being permanently fixed there ; of her being taught only what very limited means could command , and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement , to be engrafted on what nature had given her in a pleasing person , good understanding , and warm - hearted , well - meaning relations .
thought Emma , " he would have done as much for Harriet ."
You must grant me that ."
Do not distress her ."
Miss Taylor , if you had not married , you would have staid at home with me ."
" What is the matter ?"
That would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance !
He had found her agitated and low .-- Frank Churchill was a villain .-- He heard her declare that she had never loved him .
They must keep as much together as they could ;" and James was talked to , and given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage .
She touched -- she admitted -- she acknowledged the whole truth .
It was precisely what Emma would have wished , had she deemed it possible enough for wishing .
Till this year , every long vacation since their marriage had been divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey ; but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea - bathing for the children , and it was therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by their Surry connexions , or seen at all by Mr . Woodhouse , who could not be induced to get so far as London , even for poor Isabella ' s sake ; and who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit .
She promised him again and again to come -- much oftener than he doubted -- and was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy , such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it .
Oh !
But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge !
" There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all --" he began rather quickly , but checking himself , added , " however , it is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were -- how it might all be behind the scenes .
Had she been a person of consequence herself , he would have come I dare say ; and it would not have signified whether he did or no .
Ours are all apple - tarts .
.
A circumstance rather unlucky occurred .
They called for him in their way ; were all extremely amused ; and my brother asked him to dine with them the next day -- which he did -- and in the course of that visit ( as I understand ) he found an opportunity of speaking to Harriet ; and certainly did not speak in vain .-- She made him , by her acceptance , as happy even as he is deserving .
" Brother and sister !
He thought much of the evils of the journey for her , and not a little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some of the party the last half of the way ; but his alarms were needless ; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished , and Mr . and Mrs . John Knightley , their five children , and a competent number of nursery - maids , all reaching Hartfield in safety .
Elton , and Miss Hawkins !-- Good morning to you ."
" What is this ?-- What is this ?"
I am sure , rather than run the risk of hurting Mr . and Mrs . Cole , you would stay a little longer than you might wish .
While he was so dull , it was no wonder that Harriet should be dull likewise ; and they were both insufferable .
You and Miss Smith , and Miss Fairfax , will be three , and the two Miss Coxes five ; and for five couple there will be plenty of room ."
" And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess ?-- I pity you .-- I thought you cleverer -- for , depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck .
They are very important -- and sorry I am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them .
There , not to be vulgar , was distinction , and merit .
-- Those were the words ; in them lay the tormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of , and which constituted the real misery of the business to her .
I wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour .
I hope he may long continue to feel all the value of such a reconciliation .-- He is a very liberal thanker , with his thousands and tens of thousands .--` Happier than I deserve .'
Her eyes were towards Donwell as she walked , but she saw him not .
In half an hour the arrowroot was returned , with a thousand thanks from Miss Bates , but " dear Jane would not be satisfied without its being sent back ; it was a thing she could not take -- and , moreover , she insisted on her saying , that she was not at all in want of any thing ."
She would not stir a step , nor drop a hint .
Though her nephew had had no particular reason to hasten back on her account , she had not lived above six - and - thirty hours after his return .
I do not by any means engage for its being returned .
said she .-- " The regularity and despatch of it !
A young lady who faints , must be recovered ; questions must be answered , and surprizes be explained .
However , I think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again .
Mrs . Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal of agitation herself ; and in the first place had wished not to go at all at present , to be allowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead , and to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed , and Mr . Churchill could be reconciled to the engagement ' s becoming known ; as , considering every thing , she thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports :-- but Mr . Weston had thought differently ; he was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her family , and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it ; or if it were , that it would be of any consequence ; for " such things ," he observed , " always got about ."
Miss Woodhouse , I would rather done any thing than have it happen : and yet , you know , there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly .
" Oh !
Mr . Weston had accompanied her to Mrs . Bates ' s , and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely ; but she having then induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing , was now returned with much more to say , and much more to say with satisfaction , than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs . Bates ' s parlour , with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings , could have afforded .
We never heard of such things at Maple Grove ."
.
Such an adventure as this ,-- a fine young man and a lovely young woman thrown together in such a way , could hardly fail of suggesting certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain .
Bought at Weymouth , you know -- Mr . Dixon ' s choice .
--
It was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage .
Mr . Woodhouse ' s peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill - bestowed .
" Oh !"
" Oh !
dear , Kingston -- are you ?-- Mrs .
She had no sense of superiority then .
she is absolutely charming !
Are you speaking of -- Mr .
She would not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match for her , hereafter , with either of Isabella ' s sons ; but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best .
The last night ' s ball seemed lost in the gipsies .
They were just approaching the house where lived Mrs . and Miss Bates .
It is such enjoyment to them , that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of their taking turns , whichever began would never give way to the other ."
" Me !-- oh !
This is all that I can relate of the how , where , and when .
Her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses ; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess , who had fallen little short of a mother in affection .
Till you chose to turn her into a friend , her mind had no distaste for her own set , nor any ambition beyond it .
One perplexity , however , arose , which the gentlemen did not disdain .
I always regret excessively on dear Emma ' s account that she cannot be more at Highbury ; but now their daughter is married , I suppose Colonel and Mrs . Campbell will not be able to part with her at all .
And ever since she was twelve , Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all .
My greatest danger , perhaps , in housekeeping , may be quite the other way , in doing too much , and being too careless of expense .
There is no comparison between them .
One man ' s style must not be the rule of another ' s .
I was once very near -- and I wish I had -- it would have been better .
It can be allowable only as the thought of the moment ."
Where a man does his best with only moderate powers , he will have the advantage over negligent superiority .
They ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through the winter .
I think Harriet is doing extremely well .
I do not advise you to give way to it , Harriet .
The longer she considered it , the greater was her sense of its expediency .
Somebody said that _Miss_ Gilbert was expected at her brother ' s , and must be invited with the rest .
" And then their uncle comes in , and tosses them up to the ceiling in a very frightful way !"
There is my sister ; and really quite her own little elegant figure !-- and the face not unlike .
If I come , I shall be cross ."
She read , and was surprized .
You are the worst judge in the world , Mr . Knightley , of the difficulties of dependence .
" My Emma , he means no such thing .
Nothing , but to grow more worthy of him , whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her own .
she _shall_ _not_ do such a thing again ," eagerly rejoined Mrs . Elton .
She was to convey Harriet , and they drove to the Crown in good time , the Randalls party just sufficiently before them .
Had she been a person of consequence herself , he would have come I dare say ; and it would not have signified whether he did or no .
One can see that she feels the want of encouragement .
She would not look again .
That was your name for him , was it ?"
a word to the wise .-- I am in a fine flow of spirits , an ' t I ?

Miss Nash has put down all the texts he has ever preached from since he came to Highbury .
