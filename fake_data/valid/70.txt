It was a style of beauty , of which elegance was the reigning character , and as such , she must , in honour , by all her principles , admire it :-- elegance , which , whether of person or of mind , she saw so little in Highbury .
They must keep as much together as they could ;" and James was talked to , and given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage .
Miss Woodhouse , the comfort of being sometimes alone !"
" The carriage !
You must get his consent before you ask mine ."
" Ah !
" She must be under some sort of penance , inflicted either by the Campbells or herself .
snows a little I see ."
I had not thought of it before , but that is the best way .
" Very well -- and as Randalls , I suppose , is not likely to have less influence than heretofore , it strikes me as a possible thing , Emma , that Henry and John may be sometimes in the way .
When this was over , Mr . Woodhouse gratefully observed , " It is very kind of you , Mr . Knightley , to come out at this late hour to call upon us .
" You may well be amazed ," returned Mrs . Weston , still averting her eyes , and talking on with eagerness , that Emma might have time to recover -- " You may well be amazed .
Such a debasement on his !
It seemed at first an accidental division , but it never materially varied .
" Oh no !
And as it is some months since Miss Campbell married , the impression may be a little worn off ."
It was a dislike so little just -- every imputed fault was so magnified by fancy , that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any considerable absence , without feeling that she had injured her ; and now , when the due visit was paid , on her arrival , after a two years ' interval , she was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners , which for those two whole years she had been depreciating .
" Yes -- I _have_ called there ; passing the door , I thought it better .
.
Is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers ; and has not Mrs . Weston some inimitable figure - pieces in her drawing - room , at Randalls ?"
Mr . Woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused .
However , I think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again .
Mrs . Weston undertakes to direct the whole ."
yes , I am quite aware of that .
I shall certainly be at leisure ."
If _we_ exert ourselves , I think we shall not be long in want of allies .
And now I can tolerably comprehend his behaviour .
But Mr . Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits , not at all to confuse his intellects .
I wonder how she speaks of the Coles -- what she calls them !
He had caught both substance and shadow -- both fortune and affection , and was just the happy man he ought to be ; talking only of himself and his own concerns -- expecting to be congratulated -- ready to be laughed at -- and , with cordial , fearless smiles , now addressing all the young ladies of the place , to whom , a few weeks ago , he would have been more cautiously gallant .
Emma made as slight a reply as she could ; but it was fully sufficient for Mrs . Elton , who only wanted to be talking herself .
He thought it very well done of Mr . Knightley to invite them -- very kind and sensible -- much cleverer than dining out .-- He was not fond of dining out ."
And how tired you must be after your journey !
" I certainly will come .
She heard enough to know that Mr . Weston was giving some information about his son ; she heard the words " my son ," and " Frank ," and " my son ," repeated several times over ; and , from a few other half - syllables very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son ; but before she could quiet Mr . Elton , the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her would have been awkward .
" No , not now , I thank you .
Poor Mr . Woodhouse trembled as he sat , and , as Emma had foreseen , would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again .
He will connect himself well if he can ."
He is but young , and his uncle , perhaps --"
He cut her short with ,
-- Harriet ' s was --
" Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before ."
Better wait an hour or two , or even half a day for your letters , than run the risk of bringing on your cough again .
Every body in and about Highbury who had ever visited Mr . Elton , was disposed to pay him attention on his marriage .
" Well ," said she , " and you soon silenced Mr . Cole , I suppose ?"
He began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick - chamber again , for the present -- to entreat her to _promise_ _him_ not to venture into such hazard till he had seen Mr . Perry and learnt his opinion ; and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course , there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her .
After these came a second set ; among the most come - at - able of whom were Mrs . and Miss Bates , and Mrs . Goddard , three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield , and who were fetched and carried home so often , that Mr . Woodhouse thought it no hardship for either James or the horses .
Consider from how partial a quarter your information came .
It would hold the very number for comfort .
" How d ' ye do ?-- how d ' ye do ?-- We have been sitting with your father -- glad to see him so well .
Churchill ."
You forget how time passes ."
said she , with a conscious look .
He might be able to join them in the evening , but certainly not to dinner .
Mrs . Elton eagerly interposed with ,
You were very popular before you came , because you were Mr . Weston ' s son -- but lay out half a guinea at Ford ' s , and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues ."
Goddard ' s ."
I never met with her equal .
CHAPTER VII
" Indifferent !
Many circumstances assisted the temptation .
Her cheeks flushed at the name , and she felt afraid of something , though she knew not what .
It was adventuring too far , assuming too much , making light of what ought to be serious , a trick of what ought to be simple .
She does not depend upon his coming so much as I do : but she does not know the parties so well as I do .
Still , however , he was not happy .
" Yes , very soon .
cried Emma , collecting herself resolutely --" Let us understand each other now , without the possibility of farther mistake .
" I dare say you would ; but I , simple I , saw nothing but the fact , that Miss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr . Dixon caught her .-- It was the work of a moment .
.
Well , I wish them happy with all my heart .
" No , but it did not absolutely rain when I set out ."
" It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined !
" Depend upon it , Mrs . Churchill does every thing that any other fine lady ever did .
" Depend upon it , Mrs . Churchill does every thing that any other fine lady ever did .
" And if you find them troublesome , you must send them home again ."
Ah !
" And if you find them troublesome , you must send them home again ."
" Is she unwell ?"
Mrs . Weston again , and again , and again , you see .
If the errand were not a pleasure to me , it could be done , as it always is when I am not here , by my grandmama ' s ."
Nobody else would come so early .'
" Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately ?
Whether he were overhearing too , she could not determine .
Elton ?"
Mr . Elton made his appearance .
The Coles expressed themselves so properly -- there was so much real attention in the manner of it -- so much consideration for her father .
It did appear -- there was no concealing it -- exactly like the pretence of being in love with her , instead of Harriet ; an inconstancy , if real , the most contemptible and abominable !
Is not she an angel in every gesture ?
Still , however , affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment .
Tea passed pleasantly , and nobody seemed in a hurry to move .
The case is , you see , that the Campbells are going to Ireland .
She introduced him to her friend , Miss Smith , and , at convenient moments afterwards , heard what each thought of the other .
Churchill ."
Even if this family , the Braithwaites , are put off , I am still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us .
She recovered her voice .
" Very true .-- Well , a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again , late at night , and cold as the nights are now .
" We were too magnificent ," said he .
sir -- but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a window - curtain , and throw up a sash , without its being suspected .
While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to myself , but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation in approving .
" Yes ; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move , and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure , and fancying himself extremely expert in finding excuses for it .
