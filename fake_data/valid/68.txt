Indeed they are very delightful apples , and Mrs . Wallis does them full justice -- only we do not have them baked more than twice , and Mr . Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times -- but Miss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it .
She knew a family near Maple Grove who had tried it , and been obliged to separate before the end of the first quarter .
It is so with some men .
At this moment , an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma ' s brain with regard to Jane Fairfax , this charming Mr . Dixon , and the not going to Ireland , she said , with the insidious design of farther discovery ,
The dread of being awakened from the happiest dream , was perhaps the most prominent feeling .
no doubt she had been suffering a great deal : more than any body had ever supposed -- and continual pain would try the temper .
Emma thanked him , but could not allow of his disappointing his friend on their account ; her father was sure of his rubber .
Cole was saying the other day she wanted something from Kingston ."
" Well , I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does , or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out .
( with some elevation ) I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance -- of Mr . Knightley ' s coming and asking me to dance , when Mr . Elton would not stand up with me ; and when there was no other partner in the room .
said he with a tender sigh , as he received it .
There was instant pleasure in the sight of them , and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound -- for Mr . Weston immediately accosted her with ,
" Oh !
Nobody could be so imprudent !
And now she was very conscious that she ought to have prevented them .-- She felt that she had been risking her friend ' s happiness on most insufficient grounds .
" Very likely .-- I think they are , without exception , the most vulgar girls in Highbury ."
I , who am owing all my happiness to _you_ , would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them ?"
He stopped at Highbury , at the Bates ' s , I fancy , some time -- and then came on hither ; but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle , to whom he is just now more necessary than ever , that , as I tell you , he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour .-- He was very much agitated -- very much , indeed -- to a degree that made him appear quite a different creature from any thing I had ever seen him before .-- In addition to all the rest , there had been the shock of finding her so very unwell , which he had had no previous suspicion of -- and there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal ."
" He promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself from Knightley ; but he and Knightley are shut up together in deep consultation .-- Mr .
I should be as ready to acknowledge his merits as any other man ; but I hear of none , except what are merely personal ; that he is well - grown and good - looking , with smooth , plausible manners ."
I did not see you before .
" Well , well , I am ready ;"-- and turning again to Emma , " but you must not be expecting such a _very_ fine young man ; you have only had _my_ account you know ; I dare say he is really nothing extraordinary :"-- though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very different conviction .
How little did I think !-- The two Abbots and I ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by , and Miss Nash came and scolded us away , and staid to look through herself ; however , she called me back presently , and let me look too , which was very good - natured .
Exactly so , indeed -- quite unheard of -- but some ladies say any thing .
" Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day , out of so few , in having your hair cut ."
" I have no hesitation in saying ," replied Mr . Elton , though hesitating a good deal while he spoke ; " I have no hesitation in saying -- at least if my friend feels at all as _I_ do -- I have not the smallest doubt that , could he see his little effusion honoured as _I_ see it , ( looking at the book again , and replacing it on the table ), he would consider it as the proudest moment of his life ."
As far as good intentions went , we were _both_ right , and I must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong .
" Mr . Martin !
Now , an attachment to Harriet Smith would have nothing to encounter .
Harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since those two decisive dances .-- Emma knew that he had , on that occasion , found her much superior to his expectation .
Is it kingdom ?
Mr . Frank Churchill still declined it , looking as serious as he could , and his father gave his hearty support by calling out , " My good friend , this is quite unnecessary ; Frank knows a puddle of water when he sees it , and as to Mrs . Bates ' s , he may get there from the Crown in a hop , step , and jump ."
This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed ; and Mr . Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure , as he stood up , in tall indignation , and said ,
They joined company and proceeded together .
Sixteen miles -- nay , eighteen -- it must be full eighteen to Manchester - street -- was a serious obstacle .
He could not be persuaded that so many good - looking houses as he saw around him , could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting ; and even when particulars were given and families described , he was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing , or that there would be the smallest difficulty in every body ' s returning into their proper place the next morning .
I assure you , Jane Fairfax is a very delightful character , and interests me more than I can express ."
But I want to set your heart at ease as to Mrs . S .-- _My_ representation , you see , has quite appeased her ."
Donwell and Randalls had received their invitation , and none had come for her father and herself ; and Mrs . Weston ' s accounting for it with " I suppose they will not take the liberty with you ; they know you do not dine out ," was not quite sufficient .
It is just what I used to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship , when , because things did not go quite right , did not proceed with all the rapidity which suited his feelings , he was apt to be in despair , and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be _May_ before Hymen ' s saffron robe would be put on for us .
The event acquitted her of all the fancifulness , and all the selfishness of imaginary complaints .
A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed , and then , about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage , an old and not very good house , almost as close to the road as it could be .
Frank Churchill ' s confession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for more than a word in passing .
Jane ' s solicitude about fetching her own letters had not escaped Emma .
" Oh !
This letter , however , was written , and sealed , and sent .
I have read worse charades .
The intelligence , which had been so anxiously announced to her , she was now to be anxiously announcing to another .
He was not an ill - tempered man , not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a reproach ; but his temper was not his great perfection ; and , indeed , with such a worshipping wife , it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not be increased .
Every body last night said how well you played ."
As to the pretence of trying her native air , I look upon that as a mere excuse .-- In the summer it might have passed ; but what can any body ' s native air do for them in the months of January , February , and March ?
If he had never esteemed my opinion before , he would have thought highly of me then ; and , I dare say , left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had .
Every body seemed happy ; and the praise of being a delightful ball , which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be , was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this .
Well , and how did Mr . Churchill take it ?"
The evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from Mr . Elton to Mr . Woodhouse , a long , civil , ceremonious note , to say , with Mr . Elton ' s best compliments , " that he was proposing to leave Highbury the following morning in his way to Bath ; where , in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends , he had engaged to spend a few weeks , and very much regretted the impossibility he was under , from various circumstances of weather and business , of taking a personal leave of Mr . Woodhouse , of whose friendly civilities he should ever retain a grateful sense -- and had Mr . Woodhouse any commands , should be happy to attend to them ."
Yes , Friday or Saturday ; she cannot say which , because Colonel Campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days .
The manner , perhaps , may have as little to recommend them .
" He did .
I will answer for the gentleman ' s indifference ."
said Emma , as soon as she could speak .
I condition for nothing else ; but without music , life would be a blank to me .'"
Every body is asleep !"
When his letter to Mrs . Weston arrived , Emma had the perusal of it ; and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her at first shake her head over her own sensations , and think she had undervalued their strength .
" Sir ," said Mr . Woodhouse , rather warmly , " you are very much mistaken if you suppose Mr . Perry to be that sort of character .
I had not the least idea !-- Jane took Mrs . Elton aside , and told her at once , that upon thinking over the advantages of Mrs . Smallridge ' s situation , she had come to the resolution of accepting it .-- I did not know a word of it till it was all settled ."
Give me the book , I will write it down , and then there can be no possible reflection on you ."
Do not let me lose it .
I dared not address her openly ; my difficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well known to require definition ; and I was fortunate enough to prevail , before we parted at Weymouth , and to induce the most upright female mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement .-- Had she refused , I should have gone mad .-- But you will be ready to say , what was your hope in doing this ?-- What did you look forward to ?-- To any thing , every thing -- to time , chance , circumstance , slow effects , sudden bursts , perseverance and weariness , health and sickness .
Emma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr . Knightley till after supper ; but , when they were all in the ballroom again , her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked .
Often as she had wished for and ordered it , she had never been able to get any thing tolerable .
Mrs . Weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage ; and neither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded at supper .
I hope we shall have many sweet little concerts together .
How can she find any appellation for them , deep enough in familiar vulgarity ?
But you , ( turning to Mr . Knightley ,) who know how very , very seldom I am ever two hours from Hartfield , why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me , I cannot imagine .
" What !"
CHAPTER IX
He knows I have a thorough regard for him and all his family , and , I believe , considers me as one of his best friends .
And how much may be said in her situation for even that error !"
He wishes exceedingly to come ; but his uncle and aunt will not spare him ."
Any thing else I should be most happy to do , at your command -- but my dancing days are over ."
" But , Harriet , is it necessary to burn the court - plaister ?-- I have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil , but the court - plaister might be useful ."
" It was certainly never brilliant , but she would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general ; and there was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face ."
Yes , I understand the sort of mind .
Nobody , who has not been in the interior of a family , can say what the difficulties of any individual of that family may be .
" Very serious !
" It is as well , perhaps , that I have not had the possibility .
Emma would not have smiled for the world , and only said , " Is Mr . Elton gone on foot to Donwell ?-- He will have a hot walk ."
Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance ; but she could hardly devise any set of expressions , or fancy any tone of voice , less allied with real love .
" Me !
" Pray do .
Harriet , necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins , was less and less at Hartfield ; which was not to be regretted .-- The intimacy between her and Emma must sink ; their friendship must change into a calmer sort of goodwill ; and , fortunately , what ought to be , and must be , seemed already beginning , and in the most gradual , natural manner .
Emma could not but rejoice to hear that she had a fault .
that I had been satisfied with persuading her not to accept young Martin .
They arrived .-- Mrs .
CHAPTER XV
" Such a home , indeed !
" Do you dare to suppose me so great a blockhead , as not to know what a man is talking of ?-- What do you deserve ?"
Mr . Elton , who might marry any body !
He bowed .
She could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty .
