" I am here on no business of my own ," said Emma ; " I am only waiting for my friend .
Well , pretty good news , is not it ?
Emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost ; and all that was amiable , all that ought to be attaching , seemed on Harriet ' s side , not her own .
I was there -- one of the party ."
said Frank Churchill , as soon as they were out of hearing :--" How well they suit one another !-- Very lucky -- marrying as they did , upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place !-- They only knew each other , I think , a few weeks in Bath !
He did not think we ever walked this road .
" Oh !
There will be enough of them , in all probability , to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need .
" She loves him then excessively , I suppose .
Emma was in no danger of forgetting .
" My father would say ` yes ,' Mr . Knightley ` no ;' and Miss Bates and I that he is just the happy medium .
" You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates ," said Emma .
Miss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence ; and finding that nothing more was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs . Cole ' s , turned to Frank Churchill .
No such importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at present .
And as to conceit , he is the farthest from it of any man I know .
If it were to be shared with the woman he loved , he could not think any man to be pitied for having that house .
Mr . Elton ' s situation was most suitable , quite the gentleman himself , and without low connexions ; at the same time , not of any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet .
He was on the move immediately ; but coming back , said ,
Knightley !-- never seen him in her life before , and call him Knightley !-- and discover that he is a gentleman !
Resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her father , from which she was so pointedly excluded .
She believed he was looking at her ; probably reflecting on what she had said , and trying to understand the manner .
They can do nothing satisfactorily without you ."
Their being fixed , so absolutely fixed , in the same place , was bad for each , for all three .
He is just as superior as ever ;-- but being married , you know , it is quite a different thing .
You will express yourself very properly , I am sure .
It was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits , and a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it .
-- " He was generally thought so ."
" My dear Harriet , you must not refine too much upon this charade .-- You will betray your feelings improperly , if you are too conscious and too quick , and appear to affix more meaning , or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it .
You are quite mistaken .
I never could comprehend how Mr . Weston could part with him .
Jane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury , and was restored to the comforts of her beloved home with the Campbells .-- The Mr . Churchills were also in town ; and they were only waiting for November .
But that would not do .
Mr . Elton , in very good spirits , was one of the first to walk in .
The invitation was refused , and by a verbal message .
" Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would ."
I have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad .
A man who felt rightly would say at once , simply and resolutely , to Mrs . Churchill -- ` Every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience ; but I must go and see my father immediately .
" What felicity it is to hear a tune again which _has_ made one happy !-- If I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth ."
But Jane , it seems , had a letter from them very lately , and not a word was said about it .
This letter , however , was written , and sealed , and sent .
Come , Jane , take my other arm ."
His father only called him a coxcomb , and thought it a very good story ; but that Mrs . Weston did not like it , was clear enough , by her passing it over as quickly as possible , and making no other comment than that " all young people would have their little whims ."
Mrs . Weston said no more ; and Emma could imagine with what surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat .
Oh !
I like him very well ."
Isabella turned to Mrs . Weston for her approbation of the plan .
where shall we sit ?
Emma agreed to it , and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet ' s account , which she could not give any sincere explanation of .
" My poor dear Harriet !
What are we to do ?-- The year will wear away at this rate , and nothing done .
Nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be dancing in a crowd -- and a crowd in a little room !"
" My dear Harriet , you must not refine too much upon this charade .-- You will betray your feelings improperly , if you are too conscious and too quick , and appear to affix more meaning , or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it .
asked Mr . Knightley .
" And when she had come away , Mrs . Martin was so very kind as to send Mrs . Goddard a beautiful goose -- the finest goose Mrs . Goddard had ever seen .
" If I had set my heart on Mr . Elton ' s marrying Harriet , it would have been very kind to open my eyes ; but at present I only want to keep Harriet to myself .
" Emma ," said Mr . Knightley presently , " I have a piece of news for you .
She played and sang ;-- and drew in almost every style ; but steadiness had always been wanting ; and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad to command , and ought not to have failed of .
I assure you I began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous .
I think her the very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have .
" Him !-- never , never .
It was a good scheme ; but on driving to the door they heard that neither " master nor mistress was at home ;" they had both been out some time ; the man believed they were gone to Hartfield .
She had many acquaintance in the place , for her father was universally civil , but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for even half a day .
He had not been at Donwell for two years .
by the bye ," then sinking his voice , and looking demure for the moment --" I hope Mr . Knightley is well ?"
I will send you some more , before they get good for nothing .'
I promised my wife to leave it all to her .
Or a trident ?
Or Miss Bates ?
Cannot you imagine , Mr . Knightley , what a _sensation_ his coming will produce ?
But this good old Mr . Woodhouse , I wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner .
.
I had not thought of Mrs . Dixon .
" Good God !"
" Impropriety !
as to all that , of course nothing can be thought of yet .
Every body must have seen the snow coming on .
" She meant to be impertinently curious , just as such an Anne Cox should be ."
Depend upon it , he would not like to have his charade slighted , much better than his passion .
Mrs . Weston laughed , and said he did not know what he was talking about .
" It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to , if Mr . and Mrs . Weston do not .
We have nothing clever to say -- not one of us .
I could not bear to have Henry supplanted .-- Mr . Knightley marry !-- No , I have never had such an idea , and I cannot adopt it now .
I love to look at her ; and I will add this praise , that I do not think her personally vain .
.
See the consequence of keeping you company !-- What do you say to it ?"
Miss Woodhouse , do talk to me and make me comfortable again ."
Oh !
But still I cannot imagine she would not be persuaded ."
I should certainly have called at Hartfield , had you failed to come ."
It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned .
I shall have many fellow - mourners for the ball , if not for Frank Churchill ; but Mr . Knightley will be happy .
Jane ' s alertness in moving , proved her as ready as her aunt had preconceived .
The list she drew up when only fourteen -- I remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit , that I preserved it some time ; and I dare say she may have made out a very good list now .
No , no ; she has qualities which may be trusted ; she will never lead any one really wrong ; she will make no lasting blunder ; where Emma errs once , she is in the right a hundred times ."
my dear , but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any good ; and as to myself , I have been long perfectly convinced , though perhaps I never told you so before , that the sea is very rarely of use to any body .
Heaven forbid !
Well , now I have just given you a hint of what Jane writes about , we will turn to her letter , and I am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than I can tell it for her ."
-- She did not suspect him .
You are always with me ."
cried the good - hearted Mrs . John Knightley .
