But I think , my dear , you said you had got it ."
His information and prospects as to Enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated ; Mrs . Churchill was recovering , and he dared not yet , even in his own imagination , fix a time for coming to Randalls again .
I believe I did not play with the children quite so much as usual .
The older a person grows , Harriet , the more important it is that their manners should not be bad ; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness , or coarseness , or awkwardness becomes .
" I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father -- or even may be some encumbrance to you , if your visiting engagements continue to increase as much as they have done lately ."
Mrs . Weston , I am not to be talked out of my dislike of Harriet Smith , or my dread of its doing them both harm ."
Every thing so good !"
We know , on the contrary , that he has so much of both , that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in the kingdom .
Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust to people of that sort ; for there is a family in that neighbourhood who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give themselves !
made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some pages ago already .
" Shall I ring the bell ?"
Her father never went beyond the shrubbery , where two divisions of the ground sufficed him for his long walk , or his short , as the year varied ; and since Mrs . Weston ' s marriage her exercise had been too much confined .
If a separation of two months should not have cooled him , there were dangers and evils before her :-- caution for him and for herself would be necessary .
Mr . John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure , but said only , coolly ,
there he is .
A fine open sea , he says , and very pure air .
Mrs . Weston undertakes to direct the whole ."
He seemed by this connexion between the families , quite to belong to her .
She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from Mr . Elton , and now did full justice to ; and Harriet blushed and smiled , and said she had always thought Mr . Elton very agreeable .
Emma said it would be awkward ; Mrs . Weston was in distress about the supper ; and Mr . Woodhouse opposed it earnestly , on the score of health .
Here was a dangerous opening .
Time did not compose her .
Every body last night said how well you played ."
Do let me hear what she says .'"
He was gone the next moment :-- after another moment ' s pause ,
Mr . Woodhouse came in , and very soon led to the subject again , by the recurrence of his very frequent inquiry of " Well , my dears , how does your book go on ?-- Have you got any thing fresh ?"
" Good morning to you ,"-- said he , rising and walking off abruptly .
As she reflected more , she seemed but to feel it more .
She believed he had been drinking too much of Mr . Weston ' s good wine , and felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense .
I am sure I must have been as white as my gown .
you are too scrupulous , indeed you are ," cried Emma warmly , and taking her hand .
" I believe I have been very rude ; but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair in so odd a way -- so very odd a way -- that I cannot keep my eyes from her .
In her mother she lost the only person able to cope with her .
Emma pondered a moment , and then replied , " I will not pretend _not_ to understand you ; and to give you all the relief in my power , be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me , as you are apprehensive of ."
" The carriage !
_I_ think seriously of Miss Smith !-- Miss Smith is a very good sort of girl ; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled .
He had a very fine flock , and , while she was with them , he had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country .
" Aye , I see what you are thinking of , the pianoforte .
Perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can : at any rate do not let them carry you far , unless you are persuaded of his liking you .
There is great fear , great caution , great resolution somewhere .-- She is _not_ to be with the _Dixons_ .
" I know you , I know you ; you would take up with any thing ; but I shall be a little more nice , and I am sure the good Campbells will be quite on my side ; with your superior talents , you have a right to move in the first circle .
And as to smaller - sized rooms than I had been used to , I really could not give it a thought .
I thought I could not be so deceived ; but now , it is clear ; the state of his mind is as clear and decided , as my wishes on the subject have been ever since I knew you .
` You _must_ _all_ spend your evening with us ,' said she --` I positively must have you _all_ come .'"
" It was certainly never brilliant , but she would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general ; and there was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face ."
Now , however , I see nothing in it but a very natural and consistent degree of discretion .
Yes , I see what she means , ( turning to Mr . Knightley ,) and I will try to hold my tongue .
So she thought at first ;-- but a little consideration convinced her that every thing need not be put off .
" Oh !
Every body who sees it is struck by its beauty ; but to me , it has been quite a home .
" Miss Woodhouse , as you will not give me your opinion , I must do as well as I can by myself ; and I have now quite determined , and really almost made up my mind -- to refuse Mr . Martin .
Would Jane but go , means were to be found , servants sent , friends contrived -- no travelling difficulty allowed to exist ; but still she had declined it !
Mrs . Weston said no more ; and Emma could imagine with what surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat .
" It would be a crowd -- a sad crowd ; and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in ?"
A _small_ half - glass , put into a tumbler of water ?
Dixon !"
I wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance , in being able to pay her such attentions , as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father , when her society must be so irksome ."
Emma then looked up , and immediately saw how it was ; and after a moment ' s debate , as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not , replied ,
" So much the better -- or so much the worse :-- I do not know which .
said Emma in a whisper .
You cannot mean that he has even proposed to her again -- yet .
_She_ was not present when the suspicion first arose .
He shook his head with a smile , and looked as if he had very little doubt and very little mercy .
Emma listened , and then coolly said , " I shall not be satisfied , unless he comes ."
It is such a happiness when good people get together -- and they always do .
but her lips were closed .
He has been opening the doors very often this evening , and keeping them open very inconsiderately .
She was reminded , more than once , of having always said she would never marry , and assured that it would be a great deal better for her to remain single ; and told of poor Isabella , and poor Miss Taylor .-- But it would not do .
" Aye , that will be much best ," said Harriet , quite satisfied , " I should not at all like to have it sent to Mrs .
It is a great change ; and though she is amazingly fortunate -- such a situation , I suppose , as no young woman before ever met with on first going out -- do not think us ungrateful , Miss Woodhouse , for such surprising good fortune --( again dispersing her tears )-- but , poor dear soul !
When you have lived to my age , you will begin to think letters are never worth going through the rain for ."
Mr . Elton was only too happy .
Harriet looked grave .
The evening before this great event ( for it was a very great event that Mr . Woodhouse should dine out , on the 24th of December ) had been spent by Harriet at Hartfield , and she had gone home so much indisposed with a cold , that , but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs . Goddard , Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house .
CHAPTER IX
I certainly get better and better .-- Now for it ."
However , this does make a difference ; and , perhaps , when we come to talk it over -- but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration .
" Oh !
I think you will agree with me , ( turning with a soft air to Emma ,) I think I shall certainly have your approbation , though Mr . Knightley perhaps , from being used to the large parties of London , may not quite enter into our feelings ."
Emma listened , and looked , and soon perceived that Frank Churchill ' s state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of humour .
Mr . and Mrs . Elton , indeed , shewed no unwillingness to mix , and be as agreeable as they could ; but during the two whole hours that were spent on the hill , there seemed a principle of separation , between the other parties , too strong for any fine prospects , or any cold collation , or any cheerful Mr . Weston , to remove .
If you do not call early it will be a slight ."
They were both so truly respectable in their happiness , so disinterested in every sensation ; thought so much of Jane ; so much of every body , and so little of themselves , that every kindly feeling was at work for them .
that I had never seen her !"
He was here only a quarter of an hour , and in a state of agitation which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay -- but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said .
She was the instigator .
" Not I , indeed .
I could not stay two minutes .
Harriet certainly was not clever , but she had a sweet , docile , grateful disposition , was totally free from conceit , and only desiring to be guided by any one she looked up to .
That is your date .
said she , as they proceeded -- speaking more to assist Mr . Weston in keeping his secret , than with any other view .
She is always so attentive to them !"
It was kindly said , and very far from giving offence .
` How could he contrive to come ?
And is she , at seventeen , just entering into life , just beginning to be known , to be wondered at because she does not accept the first offer she receives ?
He has a wife and family to maintain , and is not to be giving away his time .
As Frank Churchill ' s arrival had succeeded Mr . Elton ' s engagement in the conversation of Highbury , as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first , so now upon Frank Churchill ' s disappearance , Mr . Elton ' s concerns were assuming the most irresistible form .-- His wedding - day was named .
Did not keep the horses a moment .
I think , Emma , I shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us .
It would be an interesting , and certainly a very kind undertaking ; highly becoming her own situation in life , her leisure , and powers .
