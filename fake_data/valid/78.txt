said Jane , shaking her head ; " dear Mrs . Elton , who can have thought of it as I have done ?"
" John does not even mention your friend ," said Mr . Knightley .
Every body last night said how well you played ."
And , by what I understand , you might have had lodgings there quite away from the sea -- a quarter of a mile off -- very comfortable .
She was sorry , very sorry .
Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own !
" But there may be pretty good guessing .
I need not so totally despair of an equal alliance , as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith !-- No , madam , my visits to Hartfield have been for yourself only ; and the encouragement I received --"
I hope , with all my heart , the young man may be a Weston in merit , and a Churchill in fortune .-- But Harriet Smith -- I have not half done about Harriet Smith .
CHAPTER XVIII
She felt that she should like to have had the power of refusal ; and afterwards , as the idea of the party to be assembled there , consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her , occurred again and again , she did not know that she might not have been tempted to accept .
and resolved , that his mourning should be as handsome as possible ; and his wife sat sighing and moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense , true and steady .
" So far as that it relates to Mr . Frank Churchill , I do guess ."
" Very like Maple Grove indeed !-- She was quite struck by the likeness !-- That room was the very shape and size of the morning - room at Maple Grove ; her sister ' s favourite room ."
This , Emma could not doubt , was all for herself .
His first proposition and request , that the dance begun at Mr . Cole ' s should be finished there -- that the same party should be collected , and the same musician engaged , met with the readiest acquiescence .
They were just approaching the house where lived Mrs . and Miss Bates .
I shall be at home in twenty minutes ."
Delighted to hear it indeed .
" These matters are always a secret , till it is found out that every body knows them .
.
CHAPTER XVII
Knightley !-- never seen him in her life before , and call him Knightley !-- and discover that he is a gentleman !
Mr . and Mrs . John Knightley , from having been longer than usual absent from Surry , were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest .
" Excuse me , ma ' am , but this is by no means my intention ; I make no inquiry myself , and should be sorry to have any made by my friends .
They were going to remove immediately to Richmond .
In respectability of character , there can be no doubt that they are .
She must not appear to think it a misfortune .-- With all the spirits she could command , she prepared him first for something strange , and then , in a few words , said , that if his consent and approbation could be obtained -- which , she trusted , would be attended with no difficulty , since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all -- she and Mr . Knightley meant to marry ; by which means Hartfield would receive the constant addition of that person ' s company whom she knew he loved , next to his daughters and Mrs . Weston , best in the world .
I should be as ready to acknowledge his merits as any other man ; but I hear of none , except what are merely personal ; that he is well - grown and good - looking , with smooth , plausible manners ."
Go and eat and drink a little more , and you will do very well .
You do not think I could mean _you_ , or suppose Mr . Knightley to mean _you_ .
No lurking horrors were to upbraid him for his easy credulity .
" No -- Mrs . Knightley ;-- and till she is in being , I will manage such matters myself ."
" But where could _you_ hear it ?"
He was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning home , but no assurances could convince him that it was safe to stay ; and while the others were variously urging and recommending , Mr . Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences : thus --
Had it been allowable entertainment , had there been no pain to her friend , or reproach to herself , in the waverings of Harriet ' s mind , Emma would have been amused by its variations .
I beg your pardon .
Mr . John Knightley smiled , and replied ,
That she was really ill was very certain ; he had declared himself convinced of it , at Randalls .
Nonsense !
She gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence ; but was really obliged to put an end to it , and request him to place himself elsewhere .
She had heard , as soon as she got back to Mrs . Goddard ' s , that Mr . Martin had been there an hour before , and finding she was not at home , nor particularly expected , had left a little parcel for her from one of his sisters , and gone away ; and on opening this parcel , she had actually found , besides the two songs which she had lent Elizabeth to copy , a letter to herself ; and this letter was from him , from Mr . Martin , and contained a direct proposal of marriage .
" I do not see much sign of it .
I hope you do not retract what you then said ."
" And so she is to come to us next Friday or Saturday , and the Campbells leave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following -- as you will find from Jane ' s letter .
she _shall_ _not_ do such a thing again ," eagerly rejoined Mrs . Elton .
The most unaccountable business !
I went in for three minutes , and was detained by Miss Bates ' s being absent .
" A very serious sort , I assure you ;" still smiling .
" These are the sights , Harriet , to do one good .
those dear little children .
" You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax , sir , are you ?"
I think you will agree with me , ( turning with a soft air to Emma ,) I think I shall certainly have your approbation , though Mr . Knightley perhaps , from being used to the large parties of London , may not quite enter into our feelings ."
" Poor girl !"
I will send you some more , before they get good for nothing .'
He knows it to be so , by his promises and messages ; but if he wished to do it , it might be done .
Interference -- fruitless interference .
Yes , I see what she means , ( turning to Mr . Knightley ,) and I will try to hold my tongue .
Elton was sitting here , I remember , much about where I am now ."
" I am not at all surprized at you , Harriet .
How did you all behave ?
For Miss ----------, read Miss Smith .
She had been often remiss , her conscience told her so ; remiss , perhaps , more in thought than fact ; scornful , ungracious .
I am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner , and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to be wholly unmodulated as I stood here ."
" Very well , I am much obliged to you .
She felt herself a most fortunate woman ; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought , where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled , and who could ill bear to part with her .
While they talked , they were advancing towards the carriage ; it was ready ; and , before she could speak again , he had handed her in .
" Oh !
This will be complete enjoyment ; and I do not know , Mrs . Elton , whether the uncertainty of our meetings , the sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to - day or to - morrow , and at any hour , may not be more friendly to happiness than having him actually in the house .
" He is very plain , undoubtedly -- remarkably plain :-- but that is nothing compared with his entire want of gentility .
This , Harriet , is an alliance which can never raise a blush in either of us ."
I have taken some pains for your sake , and for Robert Martin ' s sake , ( whom I have always had reason to believe as much in love with her as ever ,) to get acquainted with her .
" That is as formidable an image as you could present , Harriet ; and if I thought I should ever be like Miss Bates !
Harriet listened , and Emma drew in peace .
Mrs . Weston was sorry for such a charge .
" Yes , so I imagined .
Cannot you imagine , Mr . Knightley , what a _sensation_ his coming will produce ?
" There is no saying , indeed ," replied Harriet rather solemnly .
But , perhaps -- I may be equally in the way here .
" My dear sir , upon no account in the world ; my father can direct me ."
You will say that I am quite an invalid , and go no where , and therefore must decline their obliging invitation ; beginning with my _compliments_ , of course .
" Him !-- never , never .
To complete every other recommendation , he had _almost_ told her that he loved her .
" Well ," said Mrs . Weston , smiling , " you give him credit for more simple , disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do ; for while Miss Bates was speaking , a suspicion darted into my head , and I have never been able to get it out again .
" Yes ," replied Harriet modestly , but not fearfully --" I must say that I have ."
" Knightley !"
The result of his reverie was , " No , Emma , I do not think the extent of my admiration for her will ever take me by surprize .-- I never had a thought of her in that way , I assure you ."
But Emma still shook her head in steady scepticism .
It did , however .-- Her father was quite taken up with the surprize of so sudden a journey , and his fears that Mr . Elton might never get safely to the end of it , and saw nothing extraordinary in his language .
He might be superseded by another ; he certainly would indeed ; nothing could be clearer ; even a Robert Martin would have been sufficient ; but nothing else , she feared , would cure her .
A man who felt rightly would say at once , simply and resolutely , to Mrs . Churchill -- ` Every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience ; but I must go and see my father immediately .
Yes , good man !-- thought Emma -- but what has all that to do with taking likenesses ?
" You , who have been the best friend I ever had in my life -- Want gratitude to you !-- Nobody is equal to you !-- I care for nobody as I do for you !-- Oh !
Emma and Harriet had been walking together one morning , and , in Emma ' s opinion , had been talking enough of Mr . Elton for that day .
no , no "-- cried Emma , laughing as carelessly as she could -- " Upon no account in the world .
But soon it came to be on one side ,
cried the good - hearted Mrs . John Knightley .
Poor Perry is bilious , and he has not time to take care of himself -- he tells me he has not time to take care of himself -- which is very sad -- but he is always wanted all round the country .
Randalls is such a distance .
no -- far from it -- certainly plain .
