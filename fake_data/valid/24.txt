" I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time , you had very great amusement in tricking us all .-- I am sure you had .-- I am sure it was a consolation to you ."
I shall do something to expose myself ."
" He had never seen so lovely a face , and was delighted with her naivete ."
" It was an awkward business , my dear , your spending the autumn at South End instead of coming here .
" Well , if you give me such kind encouragement , Mr . Elton , I believe I shall try what I can do .
" Upon my word , Emma , to hear you abusing the reason you have , is almost enough to make me think so too .
Miss Woodhouse , what can we do about that ?"
Good morning to you , my dear sir .
When the Westons arrived , the kindest looks of love , the strongest of admiration were for her , from both husband and wife ; the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object , and at dinner she found him seated by her -- and , as she firmly believed , not without some dexterity on his side .
" I am happy you approved ," said Emma , smiling ; " but I hope I am not often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield ."
I could have wished , however , as you know , that you had seen Mr . Wingfield before you left home ."
Jane will be treated with such regard and kindness !-- It will be nothing but pleasure , a life of pleasure .-- And her salary !-- I really cannot venture to name her salary to you , Miss Woodhouse .
I have not forgotten it , I assure you .-- Deceived myself , I did very miserably deceive you -- and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever .
The young man had been the first admirer , but she trusted there was no other hold , and that there would be no serious difficulty , on Harriet ' s side , to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own .
" Me !
He might have doubled his presumption to me -- but poor Harriet !"
Mrs . Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note , or we should have been .-- But two such offers in one day !-- Never were such neighbours .
" Thank you .
Men of sense , whatever you may chuse to say , do not want silly wives .
He was afraid poor Isabella would not like it .
He saw a short word prepared for Emma , and given to her with a look sly and demure .
If he were to be very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now , it might augur something .
I do not want to say more than is necessary -- I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done , and I dare say you understand me ."
A better written letter , Harriet ( returning it ,) than I had expected ."
He was a nervous man , easily depressed ; fond of every body that he was used to , and hating to part with them ; hating change of every kind .
It might be weeks , it might be only a few days , before the horse were useable ; but no preparations could be ventured on , and it was all melancholy stagnation .
" You get upon delicate subjects , Emma ," said Mrs . Weston smiling ; " remember that I am here .-- Mr .
" Oh !
" He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two ," interrupted she , with a sort of serious smile --" much less , perhaps , than he is aware of , if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the subject ."
" Your command ?-- Yes ."
John Knightley came ; but Mr . Weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and must be absent on the very day .
If any thing could increase her delight , it was perceiving that the baby would soon have outgrown its first set of caps .
He contrived that she should be seated by him ; and was sufficiently employed in looking out the best baked apple for her , and trying to make her help or advise him in his work , till Jane Fairfax was quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again .
You are so kind !"
I would rather not be tempted .
" Indeed !
" Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith !-- Very goodnatured , I declare ."
There is my father -- another of my father -- but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous , that I could only take him by stealth ; neither of them very like therefore .
To Hartfield , if you please , Mrs .
In the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast , that the party to Box Hill was again under happy consideration ; and at last Donwell was settled for one day , and Box Hill for the next ,-- the weather appearing exactly right .
He would save himself from witnessing again such permitted , encouraged attentions .-- He had gone to learn to be indifferent .-- But he had gone to a wrong place .
In one respect he is the object of my envy ."
I could not go away you know , because of the rain ; but I did so wish myself anywhere in the world but there .-- Oh !
It was very lucky , for I would not have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account ; and I am sure she will make a very good servant : she is a civil , pretty - spoken girl ; I have a great opinion of her .
" I do not know which it ought to be called ."
You will get very tired when tea is over ."
" Oh !
A word was put in for a second young Cox ; and at last , Mr . Weston naming one family of cousins who must be included , and another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out , it became a certainty that the five couple would be at least ten , and a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they could be disposed of .
But for Harriet ' s sake , or rather for my own , and as there are no husbands and wives in the case _at_ _present_ , I will break my resolution now ."
" You appear to feel a great deal -- but I am not aware how you or any of Miss Fairfax ' s acquaintance here , any of those who have known her longer than yourself , can shew her any other attention than "--
South End is an unhealthy place .
Mr . Knightley is coming too .
" Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon ?"
At this moment whom are you thinking of ?"
She thought it would be an excellent match ; and only too palpably desirable , natural , and probable , for her to have much merit in planning it .
said he , ` I do think I can fasten the rivet ; I like a job of this kind excessively .'
She was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt Jane Fairfax ' s feelings ; and they followed the other ladies out of the room , arm in arm , with an appearance of good - will highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each .
In two minutes , however , he relented in his own favour ; and muttering something about spruce - beer , walked off .
" Harriet , poor Harriet !"
She was so eager to have them drawn that I could not refuse ; but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know ; nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them , beyond the air and complexion , unless they are coarser featured than any of mama ' s children ever were .
I really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else ."
" Exactly so ; that is what principally strikes me .
The post - office has a great charm at one period of our lives .
Let us wait , therefore , for this letter .
Arthur !-- How do you do ?
They seem not able to do any thing without him .--` Upon my word , Mr . E .,' I often say , ` rather you than I .-- I do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument , if I had half so many applicants .'
" You are in luck .-- Your only blunder was confined to my ear , when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady ."
I could have wished , however , as you know , that you had seen Mr . Wingfield before you left home ."
Emma found that she must wait ; and now it required little effort .
And then not to find him at home !
But Mrs . Dixon must be very much disappointed .
--
" No great variety of faces for you ," said Emma .
Whether it was his own idea you know , one cannot tell .
He was very much vexed .
It must be all conjecture ."
I saw she had execution , but I did not know she had any taste .
The move began ; and Miss Bates might be heard from that moment , without interruption , till her being seated at table and taking up her spoon .
Mr . Elton is going to be married ."
Emma could not think it too soon ; for with all his good and agreeable qualities , there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to laugh .
When Mr . Cole had moved away , and her attention could be restored as before , she saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room at Miss Fairfax , who was sitting exactly opposite .
At this moment whom are you thinking of ?"
Yet she could not bear this silence .
" Harriet !"
" So very kind !"
It was a great consolation that Mr . Elton should not be really in love with her , or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint him -- that Harriet ' s nature should not be of that superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive -- and that there could be no necessity for any body ' s knowing what had passed except the three principals , and especially for her father ' s being given a moment ' s uneasiness about it .
Mr . Elton was so hot and tired , that all this wit seemed thrown away .
Pain is no expiation .
" Mr . Elton indeed !"
" I have always admired her complexion ," replied Emma , archly ; " but do not I remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale ?-- When we first began to talk of her .-- Have you quite forgotten ?"
He had received a good education , but , on succeeding early in life to a small independence , had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged , and had satisfied an active , cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of his county , then embodied .
And as for Harriet , I will venture to say that _she_ cannot gain by the acquaintance .
But it is even so .
He recommended it for all the children , but particularly for the weakness in little Bella ' s throat ,-- both sea air and bathing ."
She had not been prepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr . Elton ; but he was actually hurried off by Miss Bates , she jumped away from him at last abruptly to the Coles , to usher in a letter from her niece .
There are places in town , offices , where inquiry would soon produce something -- Offices for the sale -- not quite of human flesh -- but of human intellect ."
It would not be a bad thing for her to be very much in love with a proper object .
They would feel that they could trust him ; that the nephew who had done rightly by his father , would do rightly by them ; for they know , as well as he does , as well as all the world must know , that he ought to pay this visit to his father ; and while meanly exerting their power to delay it , are in their hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims .
" He is very plain , undoubtedly -- remarkably plain :-- but that is nothing compared with his entire want of gentility .
papa , we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married .
