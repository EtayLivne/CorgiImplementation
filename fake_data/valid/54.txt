" Oh !
Beyond it she would on no account proceed .
The possibility of the young man ' s coming to Mrs . Goddard ' s that morning , and meeting with Harriet and pleading his own cause , gave alarming ideas .
" It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer -- but it seems a case of necessity .
said she , as they proceeded -- speaking more to assist Mr . Weston in keeping his secret , than with any other view .
was not that her own doing too ?
The affection of such a man as Mr . Elton would have been too great a distinction .-- She never could have deserved him -- and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse would have thought it possible .
Do you sit where you like ?
Could she have chosen with whom to associate , she would not have chosen her .
At the same time , I will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint , because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing before I am aware .
Mr . John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother .
He had said that Jane Fairfax received attentions from Mrs . Elton which nobody else paid her .
It was his duty .
she cried with a most open eagerness --" Never , for the twentieth part of a moment , did such an idea occur to me .
" How much I am obliged to you ," said he , " for telling me to come to - day !-- If it had not been for you , I should certainly have lost all the happiness of this party .
I am sure I do not know who is not ."
I do not consider myself at all a fortunate person ."
But I thought he would have staid now , and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned .
Emma seriously hoped she would .
I dare say she did not understand me ."
This was the amount of the whole story ,-- of his communication and of Harriet ' s as soon as she had recovered her senses and speech .-- He dared not stay longer than to see her well ; these several delays left him not another minute to lose ; and Emma engaging to give assurance of her safety to Mrs . Goddard , and notice of there being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to Mr . Knightley , he set off , with all the grateful blessings that she could utter for her friend and herself .
" The shame ," he answered , " is all mine , or ought to be .
She was , of course , the object of their joint dislike .-- When they had nothing else to say , it must be always easy to begin abusing Miss Woodhouse ; and the enmity which they dared not shew in open disrespect to her , found a broader vent in contemptuous treatment of Harriet .
" Yes , very true .
I could very ill be spared -- but such a point had been made of my coming !
" Oh !
" Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my brother and sister are here .
How can she find any appellation for them , deep enough in familiar vulgarity ?
One says those sort of things , of course , without any idea of a serious meaning .
I am sure of your kind support and aid ."
it shews what a sad invalid I am !
" Miss Fairfax , I suppose , though you were not aware of it , had been making up her mind the whole day ?"
you answer as discreetly as she could do herself .
Then , if you please , you shall send it all to Mrs . Goddard ' s -- I do not know -- No , I think , Miss Woodhouse , I may just as well have it sent to Hartfield , and take it home with me at night .
Mrs . Weston was looking so ill , and had an air of so much perturbation , that Emma ' s uneasiness increased ; and the moment they were alone , she eagerly said ,
She played and sang ;-- and drew in almost every style ; but steadiness had always been wanting ; and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad to command , and ought not to have failed of .
was Mr . Woodhouse ' s first exclamation , and all that he could say for some time .
Are you speaking of -- Mr .
Oh !
" A material difference then ," she replied --" and no doubt you were much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives ; but does not the lapse of one - and - twenty years bring our understandings a good deal nearer ?"
According to Miss Bates -- it all came from her -- Mrs . Dixon had written most pressingly .
" What a very great pleasure it will be to you !
And it is not merely the house -- the grounds , I assure you , as far as I could observe , are strikingly like .
They must keep as much together as they could ;" and James was talked to , and given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage .
she found something else must be done .
" _I_ sick of prosperity and indulgence !
I should like it of all things ," was not plainer in words than manner .
And here I can admit , that my manners to Miss W ., in being unpleasant to Miss F ., were highly blameable .
" I declare , I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction !-- It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax , who plays so delightfully , should not have an instrument .
He has been gone only four weeks ."
I am sure he was particularly silent when Mrs . Cole told us of it at dinner ."
( in a tone of wonder and pity ,) I had no idea that the law had been so great a slavery .
She was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke , and opening the casement there , immediately called Mr . Knightley ' s attention , and every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others , as if it had passed within the same apartment .
You saw her with the Campbells , when she was the equal of every body she mixed with , but here she is with a poor old grandmother , who has barely enough to live on .
Mrs . Weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem .
Certainly I had been accustomed to every luxury at Maple Grove ; but I did assure him that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness , nor were spacious apartments .
no ," said he ; " it would be the extreme of imprudence .
Frank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch ; and though he did not say much , his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening .
I could not help being provoked ; for after all my pains , and when I had really made a very good likeness of it --( Mrs . Weston and I were quite agreed in thinking it _very_ like )-- only too handsome -- too flattering -- but that was a fault on the right side -- after all this , came poor dear Isabella ' s cold approbation of --" Yes , it was a little like -- but to be sure it did not do him justice ."
He would either have gloried in the achievement , or been ashamed of it .
Elton had just joined them , and his wife was exclaiming ,
Woodhouse ?-- I am so glad .-- Quite out of my power .-- Such a happy little circle as you find us here .-- Yes , indeed .-- Charming young man !-- that is -- so very friendly ; I mean good Mr .
He might be superseded by another ; he certainly would indeed ; nothing could be clearer ; even a Robert Martin would have been sufficient ; but nothing else , she feared , would cure her .
She meant to take her in the carriage , leave her at the Abbey Mill , while she drove a little farther , and call for her again so soon , as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous recurrences to the past , and give the most decided proof of what degree of intimacy was chosen for the future .
They might all have hoped to rise by Harriet ' s acquaintance : and besides , what was the value of Harriet ' s description ?-- So easily pleased -- so little discerning ;-- what signified her praise ?
my dear sir , how are you this morning ?
" Thank you .
I will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you ."
She was immediately up , and wanting to quit the table ; but so many were also moving , that she could not get away ; and Mr . Knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards her , and resolutely swept away by her unexamined .
_Perfection_ should not have come quite so soon ."
Every body who sees it is struck by its beauty ; but to me , it has been quite a home .
Emma is spoiled by being the cleverest of her family .
" Three - and - twenty !-- is he indeed ?-- Well , I could not have thought it -- and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother !
Her ignorance is hourly flattery .
There will be very little merit in making a good wife to such a man as Mr .
It could not be otherwise .
This was not submitted to by either lady .
He had told her that he could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at Hartfield , as he was to be at home by the middle of the day .
She was not yet quite able to see him and his charming happy wife together , without feeling uncomfortable .
Oh !
Full of thanks , and full of news , Miss Bates knew not which to give quickest .
The move began ; and Miss Bates might be heard from that moment , without interruption , till her being seated at table and taking up her spoon .
Come , Jane , take my other arm ."
Elton ?"
" And here is Mrs . Weston and Mr . Frank Churchill too !-- Quite delightful ; so many friends !"
Her mind was in a state of flutter and wonder , which made it impossible for her to be collected .
exclaimed Mr . Knightley loudly and warmly ; and with calmer asperity , added , a few moments afterwards , " No , he is not her equal indeed , for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation .
Hartfield will only put her out of conceit with all the other places she belongs to .
Oh , said I , my dear , I did say as much as I could .
What is all this ?"
" No , I have not ; I know nothing ; pray tell me ."
I am sure , a month ago , I had no more idea myself !-- The strangest things do take place !"
It was no longer in Emma ' s power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures .
It is not that I am without the wish ; but you know how impossible my father would deem it that James should put - to for such a purpose ."
I should like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the party ; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys .
He is the very best young man -- But , my dear Jane , if you remember , I told you yesterday he was precisely the height of Mr . Perry .
My blindness to what was going on , led me to act by them in a way that I must always be ashamed of , and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures , but I have no other reason to regret that I was not in the secret earlier ."
Emma could not forgive her ;-- but as neither provocation nor resentment were discerned by Mr . Knightley , who had been of the party , and had seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side , he was expressing the next morning , being at Hartfield again on business with Mr . Woodhouse , his approbation of the whole ; not so openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room , but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to Emma .
" Ah !
" Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day , out of so few , in having your hair cut ."
