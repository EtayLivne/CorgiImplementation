Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs . Weston , and of moments only of regret ; and her satisfaction -- her more than satisfaction -- her cheerful enjoyment , was so just and so apparent , that Emma , well as she knew her father , was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity ` poor Miss Taylor ,' when they left her at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort , or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own .
It is not that I am without the wish ; but you know how impossible my father would deem it that James should put - to for such a purpose ."
This , Emma could not doubt , was all for herself .
.
I hope not of a putrid infectious sort .
Mr . Woodhouse agreed to it all , but added ,
But in time they will .
" I dare say ," replied Mrs . Weston , smiling , " that I thought so _then_ ;-- but since we have parted , I can never remember Emma ' s omitting to do any thing I wished ."
A week to - morrow !-- And I have hardly begun to enjoy myself .
the letter had much better be all your own .
" I was wrong ," he continued , " in talking of its being _broke_ to you .
--
" I do not know what your opinion may be , Mrs . Weston ," said Mr . Knightley , " of this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith , but I think it a bad thing ."
CHAPTER IV
Here ,-- probably this basket with pink ribbon .
` Oh !
" Never , madam ," cried he , affronted in his turn : " never , I assure you .
Never better .-- Don ' t I hear another carriage ?-- Who can this be ?-- very likely the worthy Coles .-- Upon my word , this is charming to be standing about among such friends !
Mr . Knightley was to dine with them -- rather against the inclination of Mr . Woodhouse , who did not like that any one should share with him in Isabella ' s first day .
Emma must do Harriet good : and by supplying her with a new object of interest , Harriet may be said to do Emma good .
It was quite a different sort of thing , a sentiment distinct and independent .
" And so you actually put this piece of court - plaister by for his sake !"
But here is my father coming : you will not object to my reading the charade to him .
She touched -- she admitted -- she acknowledged the whole truth .
" You are very obliging ; but as to all that , I am very indifferent ; it would be no object to me to be with the rich ; my mortifications , I think , would only be the greater ; I should suffer more from comparison .
it is no difficulty to see who you take after !
" I agree with you exactly .
She looked back as well as she could ; but it was all confusion .
Most comfortable carriage .-- Oh !
" I am glad you approve of what I have done ," said he very comfortably .
Tell me , I charge you tell me this moment what it is ."
But , however , I found afterwards from Patty , that William said it was all the apples of _that_ sort his master had ; he had brought them all -- and now his master had not one left to bake or boil .
She need not trouble herself to pity him .
They _shall_ talk .
" Mrs . John Knightley is easily alarmed , and might be made unhappy about her sister ."
A Miss Hawkins -- that ' s all I know .
The list she drew up when only fourteen -- I remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit , that I preserved it some time ; and I dare say she may have made out a very good list now .
If Jane repressed her for a little time , she soon began again ; and though much that passed between them was in a half - whisper , especially on Mrs . Elton ' s side , there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects : The post - office -- catching cold -- fetching letters -- and friendship , were long under discussion ; and to them succeeded one , which must be at least equally unpleasant to Jane -- inquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to suit her , and professions of Mrs . Elton ' s meditated activity .
My mother often talks of your good - nature .
He was not exactly what she had expected ; less of the man of the world in some of his notions , less of the spoiled child of fortune , therefore better than she had expected .
" It will be natural for me ," he added shortly afterwards , " to speak my opinion aloud as I read .
" Well , if you give me such kind encouragement , Mr . Elton , I believe I shall try what I can do .
" I never should have presumed to think of it at first ," said she , " but for you .
Weston may grow cross from the wantonness of comfort , or his son may plague him ."
She supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his clemency ; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in his opinion .
" I am happy you approved ," said Emma , smiling ; " but I hope I am not often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield ."
Very thoughtful of Colonel Campbell , was not it ?-- He knew Miss Fairfax could have no music here .
" But still , not near enough to give me a chance of being right , if we think differently ."
They , in their different homes , and their different ways , might be looking back on it with pleasure ; but in her view it was a morning more completely misspent , more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time , and more to be abhorred in recollection , than any she had ever passed .
" Yes , to be sure , I suppose there are .
He had received a good education , but , on succeeding early in life to a small independence , had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged , and had satisfied an active , cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of his county , then embodied .
Emma agreed to it , and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet ' s account , which she could not give any sincere explanation of .
" It would be a crowd -- a sad crowd ; and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in ?"
What was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body ; and he had , therefore , earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any wedding - cake at all , and when that proved vain , as earnestly tried to prevent any body ' s eating it .
When they all sat down it was better ; to her taste a great deal better , for Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay , making her his first object .
" How is your niece , Miss Bates ?-- I want to inquire after you all , but particularly your niece .
Frank Churchill ' s character was not desperate .-- She was his own Emma , by hand and word , when they returned into the house ; and if he could have thought of Frank Churchill then , he might have deemed him a very good sort of fellow .
It was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this assertion ; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again .
Emma could hardly understand him ; he seemed in an odd humour .
" You are quite in the right ; it was most natural to pay your visit , then "--
" You are speaking of letters of business ; mine are letters of friendship ."
That ' s right .
To give up one ' s child !
" Oh yes , papa .
Every thing so good !"
" Depend upon it , Emma , a sensible man would find no difficulty in it .
According to Miss Bates -- it all came from her -- Mrs . Dixon had written most pressingly .
Miss Woodhouse , must you be going ?-- You seem but just come -- so very obliging of you ."
" I thought he meant to try his skill , by his manner of declining it yesterday ."
Emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face ; and while paying her own compliments to Mrs . Bates , and appearing to attend to the good old lady ' s replies , she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax , and return it into the purple and gold reticule by her side , saying , with significant nods ,
" But have you really heard of nothing ?"
It was the very circumstance he could have wished for .
Pray , pray attempt it .
A thousand vexatious thoughts would recur .
It was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character which I knew her to possess ; and the secrecy she had maintained , as to any such design in her former letter , was equally descriptive of its anxious delicacy .
It must be very clever , or he would not have brought it .
" But still , you will be an old maid !
The carriage -- we had disappointments about the carriage ;-- one morning , I remember , he came to me quite in despair ."
He did not know what was come to his master lately , he said , but he could hardly ever get the speech of him .
" Oh !
cried Emma , " this has been a most unfortunate -- most deplorable mistake !-- What is to be done ?"
There has been a solemn engagement between them ever since October -- formed at Weymouth , and kept a secret from every body .
But you know what I am .-- You hear nothing but truth from me .-- I have blamed you , and lectured you , and you have borne it as no other woman in England would have borne it .-- Bear with the truths I would tell you now , dearest Emma , as well as you have borne with them .
you are too scrupulous , indeed you are ," cried Emma warmly , and taking her hand .
The difference of Harriet at Mrs . Goddard ' s , or in London , made perhaps an unreasonable difference in Emma ' s sensations ; but she could not think of her in London without objects of curiosity and employment , which must be averting the past , and carrying her out of herself .
Her character appeared absolutely changed .
no ; Perry shall have all the credit ."
But Emma still shook her head in steady scepticism .
" Will you be so kind ," said she , " when I am missed , as to say that I am gone home ?-- I am going this moment .-- My aunt is not aware how late it is , nor how long we have been absent -- but I am sure we shall be wanted , and I am determined to go directly .-- I have said nothing about it to any body .
She had herself been first with him for many years past .
I do not believe I did you any good .
Ah !
Mr . Weston , do not mistake me .
But Mr . Woodhouse -- how was Mr . Woodhouse to be induced to consent ?-- he , who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a distant event .
" But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax !"
" Yes , I would .
It was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous as herself to avoid a meeting .
And to propose that she and I should unite to form a musical club !
replied he .
There was a communication before her , one which _she_ only could be competent to make -- the confession of her engagement to her father ; but she would have nothing to do with it at present .-- She had resolved to defer the disclosure till Mrs . Weston were safe and well .
