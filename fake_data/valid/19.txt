What has he been judging by ?-- I am not conscious of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him at this time for my marrying any more than at another .-- But it was so , I suppose .
.
The others had been talking of the child , Mrs . Weston giving an account of a little alarm she had been under , the evening before , from the infant ' s appearing not quite well .
When this was over , Mr . Woodhouse gratefully observed , " It is very kind of you , Mr . Knightley , to come out at this late hour to call upon us .
Her approbation , at once general and minute , warm and incessant , could not but please ; and for another half - hour they were all walking to and fro , between the different rooms , some suggesting , some attending , and all in happy enjoyment of the future .
Mrs . Elton had undoubtedly the advantage , at this time , in vanity completely gratified ; for though she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill , she could not lose by the change .
In the way of love , I am sure he does not .
" He was too good !-- she could not endure the thought !-- she would not give him such a troublesome office for the world ,"-- brought on the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances ,-- and a very few minutes settled the business .
I hope he may long continue to feel all the value of such a reconciliation .-- He is a very liberal thanker , with his thousands and tens of thousands .--` Happier than I deserve .'
Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent , which no doubt he was in the habit of receiving , to emulate the " Very true , my love ," which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion ; but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer at all .
He had turned away , and the horses were in motion .
Emma was quite relieved , and could presently say , with a little more composure ,
You pass it over very handsomely -- but you were perfectly right ."
" Oh !
" She is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one ' s eyes from .
My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings , Lords of the earth !
" Open the windows !-- but surely , Mr . Churchill , nobody would think of opening the windows at Randalls .
Instances have been known of young people passing many , many months successively , without being at any ball of any description , and no material injury accrue either to body or mind ;-- but when a beginning is made -- when the felicities of rapid motion have once been , though slightly , felt -- it must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more .
Harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude .
A private dance , without sitting down to supper , was pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women ; and Mrs . Weston must not speak of it again .
CHAPTER IV
" I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character , have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before ."
" I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls ."
that is quite surprising , for we have had a vast deal of rain here .
Emma felt that she could not do better than go home directly .
" What !"
Her spirits seemed overcome .
said Mr . Woodhouse , always the last to make his way in conversation ; " then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady .
It was made a great favour of ; and altogether it was more than I could bear ; and so I never would finish it , to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness , to every morning visitor in Brunswick Square ;-- and , as I said , I did then forswear ever drawing any body again .
I want you to save yourself from greater pain .
replied Miss Bates .
Why was the evil so dreadfully increased by Harriet ' s having some hope of a return ?
He sat musing a little while , and then said ,
I will answer for it _she_ never betrayed the least thing in the world .
Go , and interfere .
" I do not know , my dear .
The thing is determined , that is ( laughing affectedly ) as far as I can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master .
" I am sorry to find , my love , that my father does not think you looking well -- but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued .
" If you were never particularly struck by her manners before ," said she , " I think you will to - day .
He saw a short word prepared for Emma , and given to her with a look sly and demure .
Not a speck on them ."
she was going to exclaim ; but she presently found that it was a family of old friends , who were coming , like herself , by particular desire , to help Mr . Weston ' s judgment ; and they were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins , who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness , on the same errand , that it seemed as if half the company might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection .
It is a great deal more natural than one could wish , that a young man , brought up by those who are proud , luxurious , and selfish , should be proud , luxurious , and selfish too .
I made the best excuses I could for not having been able to wait on him and Mrs . Elton on this happy occasion ; I said that I hoped I _should_ in the course of the summer .
I hope you turned directly ."
" My first enjoyment ," replied John Knightley , as they passed through the sweep - gate , " will be to find myself safe at Hartfield again ."
" You had better order the carriage directly , my love ," said she ; " I dare say we shall be able to get along , if we set off directly ; and if we do come to any thing very bad , I can get out and walk .
Harriet is disgraced by any comparison .
However , she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago ; which is saying a great deal at my mother ' s time of life -- and it really is full two years , you know , since she was here .
Elton ."
How will a conundrum reckon ?"
Elton .-- This letter tells us -- it is a short letter -- written in a hurry , merely to give us notice -- it tells us that they are all coming up to town directly , on Mrs . Churchill ' s account -- she has not been well the whole winter , and thinks Enscombe too cold for her -- so they are all to move southward without loss of time ."
I always say , we are quite blessed in our neighbours .-- My dear sir , if there is one thing my mother loves better than another , it is pork -- a roast loin of pork --"
What !
" We must ask Mr . and Mrs . Weston to dine with us , while Isabella is here ."
said Mr . Woodhouse , always the last to make his way in conversation ; " then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady .
There was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest , and it caught Emma ' s attention only as it united with the subject which already engaged her mind .
" I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than Mr . Elton .
The party did not break up without Emma ' s being positively secured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening , nor without her overhearing Mr . Weston whisper to his wife , " He has asked her , my dear .
He seemed hardly to hear her ; he was thoughtful -- and in a manner which shewed him not pleased , soon afterwards said ,
Had she followed Mr . Knightley ' s known wishes , in paying that attention to Miss Fairfax , which was every way her due ; had she tried to know her better ; had she done her part towards intimacy ; had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith ; she must , in all probability , have been spared from every pain which pressed on her now .-- Birth , abilities , and education , had been equally marking one as an associate for her , to be received with gratitude ; and the other -- what was she ?-- Supposing even that they had never become intimate friends ; that she had never been admitted into Miss Fairfax ' s confidence on this important matter -- which was most probable -- still , in knowing her as she ought , and as she might , she must have been preserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr . Dixon , which she had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself , but had so unpardonably imparted ; an idea which she greatly feared had been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane ' s feelings , by the levity or carelessness of Frank Churchill ' s .
Making - up indeed would not do .
English verdure , English culture , English comfort , seen under a sun bright , without being oppressive .
But now , poor girl , her peace is cut up for some time .
The young man had been the first admirer , but she trusted there was no other hold , and that there would be no serious difficulty , on Harriet ' s side , to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own .
the good Bateses -- I am quite ashamed of myself -- but you mention them in most of your letters .
Shall I call upon them ?
We really must wish you good night ."
" Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ ," said Frank Churchill , with a smile at Emma , " the person has not chosen ill .
I have been silent from surprize merely , excessive surprize .
CHAPTER XVII
The intelligence , which had been so anxiously announced to her , she was now to be anxiously announcing to another .
If Frank Churchill had wanted to see his father , he would have contrived it between September and January .
.
This topic was discussed very happily , and others succeeded of similar moment , and passed away with similar harmony ; but the evening did not close without a little return of agitation .
oh !
The attentions of a certain person can hardly be among the tittle - tattle of Highbury yet .
I am as confident of seeing Frank here before the middle of January , as I am of being here myself : but your good friend there ( nodding towards the upper end of the table ) has so few vagaries herself , and has been so little used to them at Hartfield , that she cannot calculate on their effects , as I have been long in the practice of doing ."
he cried , " I wish your father might be half as easily convinced as John will be , of our having every right that equal worth can give , to be happy together .
I wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings .
Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a difficult question to answer ; Mr . Knightley had once told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman , which she wanted to be thought herself ; and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time , there were moments of self - examination in which her conscience could not quite acquit her .
A carriage was heard .
Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with her grandmother and aunt , and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state .
It struck her with dreadful force , and she was ready to give it every bad name in the world .
And so then , in my nonsense , I could not help making a treasure of it -- so I put it by never to be used , and looked at it now and then as a great treat ."
His gallantry was always on the alert .
She is very timid and silent .
" Very well , I am much obliged to you .
Mr . Churchill has pride ; but his pride is nothing to his wife ' s : his is a quiet , indolent , gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody , and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome ; but her pride is arrogance and insolence !
I honestly said as much to Mr . E . when he was speaking of my future home , and expressing his fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable ; and the inferiority of the house too -- knowing what I had been accustomed to -- of course he was not wholly without apprehension .
Yet she could not bear this silence .
It was his duty .
" There is no denying it ," he replied .
Well , I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland ."
Perry does not call it altogether a sickly season ."
He had returned to a late dinner , after some days ' absence , and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were well in Brunswick Square .
Her mind returned to Mrs . Elton ' s offences , and long , very long , did they occupy her .
Before the end of September , Emma attended Harriet to church , and saw her hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction , as no remembrances , even connected with Mr . Elton as he stood before them , could impair .-- Perhaps , indeed , at that time she scarcely saw Mr . Elton , but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on herself .-- Robert Martin and Harriet Smith , the latest couple engaged of the three , were the first to be married .
" My dear Harriet , I perfectly remember the substance of what I said on the occasion .
" It is as long again as almost all we have had before ."
