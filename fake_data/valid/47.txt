I was the most miserable wretch !"
With a faint blush , she presently replied ,
Do not you think so ?"
I have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours , ( turning to Emma ,) a lady residing in or near Highbury ; a family of the name of Fairfax .
Let me return your congratulations .-- I assure you that I have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction .-- He is a man whom I cannot presume to praise ."
She was pondering , in the meanwhile , upon the possibility , without seeming very rude , of making her escape from Jane Fairfax ' s letter , and had almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse , when Miss Bates turned to her again and seized her attention .
He had been detained by a temporary increase of illness in her ; a nervous seizure , which had lasted some hours -- and he had quite given up every thought of coming , till very late ;-- and had he known how hot a ride he should have , and how late , with all his hurry , he must be , he believed he should not have come at all .
" Oh yes , papa .
To Highbury in general it brought no material change .
" This was settled last night , and Frank was off with the light this morning .
cried Emma , after a moment ' s pause --" What do you mean ?-- Good Heaven !
There go you and your riddle - book one of these days ."
They must not do less than others , or she should be exposed to odious suspicions , and imagined capable of pitiful resentment .
Mrs . Weston was looking so ill , and had an air of so much perturbation , that Emma ' s uneasiness increased ; and the moment they were alone , she eagerly said ,
" Ah !-- well -- to be sure .
She and Mrs . Weston were obliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together .
What has he to do with books ?
brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private liking , of private understanding even , between Frank Churchill and Jane .
Now , my dear madam , I will release you ; but I could not conclude before .
Elton ?"
" You are right .
I am sure she will be as happy to see her friends at Highbury , as they can be to see her .
She must be collected and calm .
" Very well ; and if he had intended to give her one , he would have told her so ."
cried the good - hearted Mrs . John Knightley .
I should be as ready to acknowledge his merits as any other man ; but I hear of none , except what are merely personal ; that he is well - grown and good - looking , with smooth , plausible manners ."
You have not heard all that you ought to hear .
Excellent dancing indeed !-- Yes , my dear , I ran home , as I said I should , to help grandmama to bed , and got back again , and nobody missed me .-- I set off without saying a word , just as I told you .
If not wise or refined herself , she would have connected him with those who were ; but Miss Hawkins , it might be fairly supposed from her easy conceit , had been the best of her own set .
The whole party walked about , and looked , and praised again ; and then , having nothing else to do , formed a sort of half - circle round the fire , to observe in their various modes , till other subjects were started , that , though _May_ , a fire in the evening was still very pleasant .
" You think her diffident .
" I hope so -- for at that time I was a fool ."
" How I could so long a time be fancying myself !
where shall we sit ?
" I shall be happier to burn it ," replied Harriet .
I was fatigued .
Miss Woodhouse , what can we do about that ?"
Her father was growing nervous , and could not understand _her_ .
" Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ ," said Frank Churchill , with a smile at Emma , " the person has not chosen ill .
The symptoms were favourable .-- Instead of answering , Harriet turned away confused , and stood thoughtfully by the fire ; and though the letter was still in her hand , it was now mechanically twisted about without regard .
Mr . Knightley grew angry .
He was not exactly what she had expected ; less of the man of the world in some of his notions , less of the spoiled child of fortune , therefore better than she had expected .
But do not imagine that I want to influence you ."
" You speak too plain .
How I catch myself out !
Very pleasant party .
Here ,-- probably this basket with pink ribbon .
Have you heard from Mrs . John Knightley lately ?
It is infinitely too bad .
" Yes ."
Alas !
I was reading it to Mrs . Cole , and since she went away , I was reading it again to my mother , for it is such a pleasure to her -- a letter from Jane -- that she can never hear it often enough ; so I knew it could not be far off , and here it is , only just under my huswife -- and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she says ;-- but , first of all , I really must , in justice to Jane , apologise for her writing so short a letter -- only two pages you see -- hardly two -- and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half .
But in every respect , as she saw more of her , she approved her , and was confirmed in all her kind designs .
Her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do ; and at eighteen or nineteen she was , as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children , fully competent to the office of instruction herself ; but she was too much beloved to be parted with .
It is not Swisserland , but it will be something for a young man so much in want of a change .
The next remove was to the house ; they must all go in and eat ;-- and they were all seated and busy , and still Frank Churchill did not come .
I am amused by one part of John ' s letter -- did you notice it ?-- where he says , that my information did not take him wholly by surprize , that he was rather in expectation of hearing something of the kind ."
After an interval of some minutes , however , he began with ,
yes -- Mr . Knightley and I both saying we liked it , and Mr . Elton ' s seeming resolved to learn to like it too .
He thought much of the evils of the journey for her , and not a little of the fatigues of his own horses and coachman who were to bring some of the party the last half of the way ; but his alarms were needless ; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished , and Mr . and Mrs . John Knightley , their five children , and a competent number of nursery - maids , all reaching Hartfield in safety .
Her silence disturbed him ; and after observing her a little while , he added ,
We will follow them to Hartfield .
However , she is very agreeable , and Mrs . Bates too , in a different way .
I was late ; I met her walking home by herself , and wanted to walk with her , but she would not suffer it .
.
Yes .
Shall I ?-- Yes , I will -- I declare I will -- and you shall see how she takes it ;-- whether she colours ."
Elton ?"
Mr . Knightley was fortunate in every body ' s most ready concurrence .
" The ladies were all at home ."
You need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment ."
Very much grieved and concerned -- I had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as I knew had been given her in the morning ."
Worse and worse .
At last Emma attacked her on another ground .
Mr . Knightley could not be there too often ; he should be glad to see him every day ;-- but they did see him every day as it was .-- Why could not they go on as they had done ?
They have no mercy on her ."
Men of sense , whatever you may chuse to say , do not want silly wives .
" If we were in the other room ," said Emma , " if I had my writing - desk , I am sure I could produce a specimen .
" Yes -- it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill - humour of Mrs . Churchill , which I imagine to be the most certain thing in the world ."
She read , and was surprized .
I am serious , Miss Woodhouse , whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy -- I am sick of England -- and would leave it to - morrow , if I could ."
He will be so pleased to see my little ones ."
I am not like Jane ; I wish I were .
That would have been too dreadful !-- What an escape !-- Dear Miss Woodhouse , I would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world ."
" Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell ," said she , in a voice of forced calmness , " I can imagine nothing with any confidence .
There will be a great many people talking at once .
" That appears quite wonderful .
He has passed you very often ."
He could be no judge , however , of the evil he was holding cheap .
Being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling , I have been in no hurry with my congratulations ; but I hope it all went off tolerably well .
The rest of the gentlemen being now in the room , Emma found herself obliged to turn from him for a few minutes , and listen to Mr . Cole .
I am sure they will bring him soon ."
I like a job of that sort excessively .'
-- was a question , however , which did not augur much .
Every body had a degree of gravity and sorrow ; tenderness towards the departed , solicitude for the surviving friends ; and , in a reasonable time , curiosity to know where she would be buried .
She must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing , but if he were criticising her behaviour , she did not feel afraid .
" Dreadful !-- Exactly so , indeed .-- She will be missed every moment ."
I assure you I am not at all pleased .
" I am afraid Jane is not very well ," said she , " but I do not know ; they _tell_ me she is well .
Mrs . Cole had many to agree with her ; every body who spoke on the subject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell , and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made ; and there were enough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her own way , and still listen to Mrs . Cole .
