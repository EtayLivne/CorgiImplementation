was his reply , but not at all in anger .
" And , moreover , if you must go to the sea , it had better not have been to South End .
Mr . Knightley , what a delightful party last night ; how extremely pleasant .-- Did you ever see such dancing ?-- Was not it delightful ?-- Miss Woodhouse and Mr . Frank Churchill ; I never saw any thing equal to it ."
Excellent dancing indeed !-- Yes , my dear , I ran home , as I said I should , to help grandmama to bed , and got back again , and nobody missed me .-- I set off without saying a word , just as I told you .
It was no more than a wish .
No such importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at present .
She liked his open manners , but a little less of open - heartedness would have made him a higher character .-- General benevolence , but not general friendship , made a man what he ought to be .-- She could fancy such a man .
I am sure she will be an excellent servant ; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her that she is used to see .
said he with a tender sigh , as he received it .
" You cannot do better , sir ."
" If he could stay only a couple of days , he ought to come ; and one can hardly conceive a young man ' s not having it in his power to do as much as that .
Indeed , Miss Woodhouse , ( speaking more collectedly ,) with the consciousness which I have of misconduct , very great misconduct , it is particularly consoling to me to know that those of my friends , whose good opinion is most worth preserving , are not disgusted to such a degree as to -- I have not time for half that I could wish to say .
Harriet is disgraced by any comparison .
Latterly , however -- for some time , indeed -- I have had no idea of their meaning any thing .-- I thought them a habit , a trick , nothing that called for seriousness on my side .
" Oh !
" I shall soon bring him over to Hartfield ," said he , at the conclusion .
" Almost every moment .
How did you all behave ?
" Yes , very soon .
Emma was gratified , and would soon have shewn no want of words , if the sound of Mrs . Elton ' s voice from the sitting - room had not checked her , and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her congratulatory sensations into a very , very earnest shake of the hand .
" You must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax should be allowed to come to you at such a time .
He came to ask me whether I thought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early ; whether I thought her too young : in short , whether I approved his choice altogether ; having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered ( especially since _your_ making so much of her ) as in a line of society above him .
We must allow for the effect of shade , you know ."
Mr . Elton must smile less , and Mr . John Knightley more , to fit them for the place .-- Emma only might be as nature prompted , and shew herself just as happy as she was .
A very few days had passed after this adventure , when Harriet came one morning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand , and after sitting down and hesitating , thus began :
Better accommodations , he can promise them , and not a less grateful welcome than at Randalls .
" I have not even made any inquiry ; I do not wish to make any yet ."
Even then , I was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time ; but I was the injured person , injured by her coldness , and I went away determined that she should make the first advances .-- I shall always congratulate myself that you were not of the Box Hill party .
She was as happy as possible with the Martins in the summer .
Emma guessed him to be the drudge of some attorney , and too stupid to rise .
But now she made the sudden resolution of not passing their door without going in -- observing , as she proposed it to Harriet , that , as well as she could calculate , they were just now quite safe from any letter from Jane Fairfax .
Mrs . Smallridge is in a great hurry .
" I wonder he did not remember the book "-- was all Harriet ' s answer , and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be safely left to itself .
I hope you are quite well .
Mr . Weston might be his son ' s superior .-- In spite of this little rub , however , Emma was smiling with enjoyment , delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming , and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her .-- She was more disturbed by Mr . Knightley ' s not dancing than by any thing else .-- There he was , among the standers - by , where he ought not to be ; he ought to be dancing ,-- not classing himself with the husbands , and fathers , and whist - players , who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were made up ,-- so young as he looked !-- He could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere , than where he had placed himself .
Now , it so happened that in spite of Emma ' s resolution of never marrying , there was something in the name , in the idea of Mr . Frank Churchill , which always interested her .
Knightley ?"
" You do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as I am ; but still you must , at least I hope you must , think the better of him for it .
" No -- I have never seen Mr . Elton ," she replied , starting on this appeal ; " is he -- is he a tall man ?"
just behind .
He would either have gloried in the achievement , or been ashamed of it .
Oh , said I , my dear , I did say as much as I could .
" I met William Larkins ," continued Mr . Elton , " as I got near the house , and he told me I should not find his master at home , but I did not believe him .-- William seemed rather out of humour .
It was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was _not_ a fine lady ; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of it ;-- and she was considering in what way she had best retract , when Mr . Weston went on .
" I am glad you think so ; and the good hands , I hope , may not be wanting ."
But the idea of any thing to be done in a _moment_ , was increasing , not lessening , Mr . Woodhouse ' s agitation .
" But if I do , I shall be crosser still .
Some people are surprized , I believe , that the eldest was not , but Isabella would have him called Henry , which I thought very pretty of her .
" Oh !
I assure you , Jane Fairfax is a very delightful character , and interests me more than I can express ."
" Mrs . Bates , let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs .
Dixon !"
They added to their house , to their number of servants , to their expenses of every sort ; and by this time were , in fortune and style of living , second only to the family at Hartfield .
" Ah !
They sang together once more ; and Emma would then resign her place to Miss Fairfax , whose performance , both vocal and instrumental , she never could attempt to conceal from herself , was infinitely superior to her own .
She is very timid and silent .
" Mr . Knightley ' s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare Mr . Martin with _him_ .
Miss Woodhouse , I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball .
Miss Woodhouse , how ungrateful I have been !"
Emma was gratified , to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character , and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance .
There were Mr . and Mrs . Weston ; delighted to see her and receive her approbation , very busy and very happy in their different way ; she , in some little distress ; and he , finding every thing perfect .
I certainly get better and better .-- Now for it ."
We really must wish you good night ."
" I either depend more upon Emma ' s good sense than you do , or am more anxious for her present comfort ; for I cannot lament the acquaintance .
Emma would not agree to this , and began a warm defence of Miss Fairfax ' s complexion .
The apples themselves are the very finest sort for baking , beyond a doubt ; all from Donwell -- some of Mr . Knightley ' s most liberal supply .
Let his behaviour be the guide of your sensations .
It was a pity that she had not come back earlier !
Nobody could nurse her , as we should do ."
" But you should tell them of the letter , my dear ," said her father .
To suffer her to engage herself -- to suffer her even to think of such a measure !"
She is poor ; she has sunk from the comforts she was born to ; and , if she live to old age , must probably sink more .
We must allow for the effect of shade , you know ."
Oh dear , no !
` Not that it was such a very old petticoat either -- for still it would last a great while -- and , indeed , she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong .'"
But , perhaps -- I may be equally in the way here .
" It might be distressing , for the moment ," said she ; " but you seem to have behaved extremely well ; and it is over -- and may never -- can never , as a first meeting , occur again , and therefore you need not think about it ."
And soon afterwards , " Jane Fairfax is a very charming young woman -- but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect .
" Nonsense !
" He had just looked into the dining - room , and as he was not wanted there , preferred being out of doors ."
Yes , I immediately perceive that it must be the joint present of Mr . and Mrs . Dixon .
Emma did not want to be classed with the Mrs . Eltons , the Mrs . Perrys , and the Mrs . Coles , who would force themselves anywhere ; neither could she feel any right of preference herself -- she submitted , therefore , and only questioned Miss Bates farther as to her niece ' s appetite and diet , which she longed to be able to assist .
But I thought he would have staid now , and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned .
was not that her own doing too ?
Goldsmith tells us , that when lovely woman stoops to folly , she has nothing to do but to die ; and when she stoops to be disagreeable , it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill - fame .
It must , if I were not here .
" Your word !-- why not your honour !-- why not say upon your honour , that it has nothing to do with any of them ?
Mr . Perry is not gone ."
-- Emma had promised ; but still Harriet must be excepted .
at least , that I should ever bore people half so much about all the Knightleys together , as she does about Jane Fairfax .
When she took in her history , indeed , her situation , as well as her beauty ; when she considered what all this elegance was destined to , what she was going to sink from , how she was going to live , it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect ; especially , if to every well - known particular entitling her to interest , were added the highly probable circumstance of an attachment to Mr . Dixon , which she had so naturally started to herself .
She paused over it , while Harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion , with a " Well , well ," and was at last forced to add , " Is it a good letter ?
always my kindest friend on every occasion .
Harriet ' s cheerful look and manner established hers : she came back , not to think of Mr . Martin , but to talk of Mr . Elton .
He loves any thing of the sort , and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment .
You should have consulted Perry ."
"` Smallridge !'
It was a sad event -- a great shock -- with all her faults , what would Mr . Churchill do without her ?
replied he .
" Very well ; I will not plague you any more .
