" Highbury gossips !-- Tiresome wretches !"
The weather added what it could of gloom .
Adopt her , educate her ."
Emma felt that her own note had deserved something better ; but it was impossible to quarrel with words , whose tremulous inequality shewed indisposition so plainly , and she thought only of how she might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted .
I am sure you did not much expect to like us .
CHAPTER XVIII
He is in Highbury every now and then , and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to Kingston .
Very thoughtful of Colonel Campbell , was not it ?-- He knew Miss Fairfax could have no music here .
It must be very clever , or he would not have brought it .
I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I had been of some use ; but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they may .
Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax .
Emma ' s comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on , by Harriet ' s being to stay longer ; her fortnight was likely to be a month at least .
Her aunt is a good creature , but , as a constant companion , must be very tiresome .
There was one , however , which Emma thought something of .-- The two last dances before supper were begun , and Harriet had no partner ;-- the only young lady sitting down ;-- and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers , that how there could be any one disengaged was the wonder !-- But Emma ' s wonder lessened soon afterwards , on seeing Mr . Elton sauntering about .
" And then , he saved her life .
Do help me .
How often have I heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her !"
Oh !
" Oh !
How little did I think !-- The two Abbots and I ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he was going by , and Miss Nash came and scolded us away , and staid to look through herself ; however , she called me back presently , and let me look too , which was very good - natured .
" Your feelings are singular .
I must get on to Kingston as fast as I can ."
Mr . Elton is going to be married ."
He listened with all due deference ; acknowledged that he had heard many people say the same -- but yet he must confess , that to him nothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health .
" I am not fond of dinner - visiting ," said he --" I never was .
" There might be scruples of delicacy , my dear Emma .
I should not mind walking half the way .
Elton ."
" My father and Mrs . Weston are at the Crown at this moment ," said Frank Churchill , " examining the capabilities of the house .
" No -- Mrs . Knightley ;-- and till she is in being , I will manage such matters myself ."
She was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or two to Mrs . Goddard ' s , but it was then to be settled that she should return to Hartfield , to make a regular visit of some days .
.
He had a very fine flock , and , while she was with them , he had been bid more for his wool than any body in the country .
" Who is that gentleman on horseback ?"
" Yes ," said Jane , " we heard his kind offers , we heard every thing ."
Will you chuse a wife for me ?-- I am sure I should like any body fixed on by you .
I wonder who the friend was -- and who could be the young lady .
To understand , thoroughly understand her own heart , was the first endeavour .
" He promised to come to me as soon as he could disengage himself from Knightley ; but he and Knightley are shut up together in deep consultation .-- Mr .
He is as well acquainted with his own claims , as you can be with Harriet ' s .
She would be a loser in every way .
I say , Jane , what a perfect character you and I should make , if we could be shaken together .
Another song , however , was soon begged for .
While poor Mrs . Churchill lived , I suppose there could not have been a hope , a chance , a possibility ;-- but scarcely are her remains at rest in the family vault , than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required .
Happily , it was now time to be gone .
To guess what all this meant , was impossible even for Emma .
" There is nothing to be compared to it .
Half a dozen natural children , perhaps -- and poor Frank cut off !-- This , though very undesirable , would be no matter of agony to her .
You know , my dear , she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor was to us .
It seems an impossibility !-- You cannot mean to say , that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin .
.
Emma began to listen better .
" Emma , my love , you said that this circumstance would not now make you unhappy ; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected .
" I am not fond of dinner - visiting ," said he --" I never was .
.
A young lady who faints , must be recovered ; questions must be answered , and surprizes be explained .
According to Miss Bates -- it all came from her -- Mrs . Dixon had written most pressingly .
Mr . Knightley , what a delightful party last night ; how extremely pleasant .-- Did you ever see such dancing ?-- Was not it delightful ?-- Miss Woodhouse and Mr . Frank Churchill ; I never saw any thing equal to it ."
Behold him there , the monarch of the seas !
-- Here was a sly glance at Emma .
What !
" Oh !
" Thank you .
Mr . Elton looked all alarm on the occasion , as he exclaimed ,
She had an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man , for she hardly knew what indisposition was ; and if he did not invent illnesses for her , she could make no figure in a message .
Mr . Knightley , a sensible man about seven or eight - and - thirty , was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family , but particularly connected with it , as the elder brother of Isabella ' s husband .
A fine place , but very retired ."
Harriet was too intent on the lines to hear .
I like them extremely .
The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates .
If I could but see her again !-- But I must not propose it yet .
By a most fortunate chance his leaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him to her assistance at this critical moment .
However , the very same evening William Larkins came over with a large basket of apples , the same sort of apples , a bushel at least , and I was very much obliged , and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said every thing , as you may suppose .
I cannot see you acting wrong , without a remonstrance .
You got Hannah that good place .
Knightley ' s .-- Alas !
It was an unsuitable connexion , and did not produce much happiness .
Emma ' s sense of right however had decided it ; and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother , she had particular pleasure , from the circumstance of the late disagreement between Mr . Knightley and herself , in procuring him the proper invitation .
Mrs . Weston ' s partiality for him is very great , and , as you may suppose , most gratifying to me .
But first of all , there must be an answer written to Mrs .
Does not she , Jane ?-- Do not we often talk of Mr . Frank Churchill ?-- Ah !
I dare say he will come in when he knows who is here .
Jane was forced to smile completely , for a moment ; and the smile partly remained as she turned towards him , and said in a conscious , low , yet steady voice ,
The danger , however , was at present so unperceived , that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her .
It was Garrick ' s , you know ."
" Very true ," he gravely replied ; " it was very bad ."
Ever since the service he rendered Jane at Weymouth , when they were out in that party on the water , and she , by the sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails , would have been dashed into the sea at once , and actually was all but gone , if he had not , with the greatest presence of mind , caught hold of her habit -- ( I can never think of it without trembling !)
He had ridden home through the rain ; and had walked up directly after dinner , to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures , faultless in spite of all her faults , bore the discovery .
At present , there was nothing to be done for Harriet ; good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible on Emma ' s side .
" They told me -- that Mr . Martin dined with them last Saturday ."
It was growing late , and Miss Bates became anxious to get home , on her mother ' s account .
yes -- she will have her own room , of course ; the room she always has ;-- and there is the nursery for the children ,-- just as usual , you know .
" Harriet !"
Emma even jumped with surprize ;-- and , horror - struck , exclaimed ,
But this good old Mr . Woodhouse , I wish you had heard his gallant speeches to me at dinner .
Oh , said I , Patty do not come with your bad news to me .
Miss Smith , and Miss Bickerton , another parlour boarder at Mrs . Goddard ' s , who had been also at the ball , had walked out together , and taken a road , the Richmond road , which , though apparently public enough for safety , had led them into alarm .-- About half a mile beyond Highbury , making a sudden turn , and deeply shaded by elms on each side , it became for a considerable stretch very retired ; and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it , they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them , on a broader patch of greensward by the side , a party of gipsies .
But you see , every thing turns out for the best .
I have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad .
Perhaps it is paid already .
