Emma watched and decided , that with such feelings as were now shewn , it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting himself ; that he had not been acting a part , or making a parade of insincere professions ; and that Mr . Knightley certainly had not done him justice .
Do not we rather surpass your expectations ?
.
Emma could not but feel all this ; and then , her face -- her features -- there was more beauty in them altogether than she had remembered ; it was not regular , but it was very pleasing beauty .
Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate , I may safely affirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing .-- You never could persuade her to read half so much as you wished .-- You know you could not ."
What shall we do to rouse them ?
sir -- but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a window - curtain , and throw up a sash , without its being suspected .
A _small_ half - glass , put into a tumbler of water ?
He came to speak to his father on a subject ,-- to announce an attachment --"
I wish I may not sink into ` poor Emma ' with him at once .-- His tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther ."
If you do not call early it will be a slight ."
And after such success , you know !-- Every body said that Mr . Weston would never marry again .
" If you were never particularly struck by her manners before ," said she , " I think you will to - day .
that ' s a great pity ; for I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , where the waters do agree , it is quite wonderful the relief they give .
I give you notice -- You will find me a formidable antagonist on that point .
Certain it was that she was to come ; and that Highbury , instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which had been so long promised it -- Mr . Frank Churchill -- must put up for the present with Jane Fairfax , who could bring only the freshness of a two years ' absence .
but what shall you do ?
" From the very circumstance of its being larger , sir .
My mother says the orchard was always famous in her younger days .
That Mr . and Mrs . Weston did think of it , she was very strongly persuaded ; and though not meaning to be induced by him , or by any body else , to give up a situation which she believed more replete with good than any she could change it for , she had a great curiosity to see him , a decided intention of finding him pleasant , of being liked by him to a certain degree , and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends ' imaginations .
And now , poor girl !
Emma ' s answer was ready at the first word .
Emma could have wished Mrs . Elton elsewhere ; but she was in a humour to have patience with every body ; and as Mrs . Elton met her with unusual graciousness , she hoped the rencontre would do them no harm .
A pleasant " thank you " seemed meant to laugh it off , but a blush , a quivering lip , a tear in the eye , shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh .
To Mr . John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the subject , for the first start of its possibility .
My dear Emma , your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came to the point ."
That he should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before , passed suspiciously through Emma ' s brain ; but still , if it were a falsehood , it was a pleasant one , and pleasantly handled .
Another hour or two ' s snow can hardly make the road impassable ; and we are two carriages ; if one is blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other at hand .
" Ah !
To speak , she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness .
" _He_ is undoubtedly very much in love -- every thing denotes it -- very much in love indeed !-- and when he comes again , if his affection continue , I must be on my guard not to encourage it .-- It would be most inexcusable to do otherwise , as my own mind is quite made up .
Towards the end of Jane ' s second song , her voice grew thick .
" Donwell !"
She will enjoy the scheme , I am sure ; and I do not know a properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties .
He knows that he is a very handsome young man , and a great favourite wherever he goes ; and from his general way of talking in unreserved moments , when there are only men present , I am convinced that he does not mean to throw himself away .
They would catch worse colds at the Crown than anywhere ."
Short of that , it is all guess and luck -- and will generally be ill - luck .
There are people , who the more you do for them , the less they will do for themselves .
Emma allowed her father to talk -- but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style , and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy .
Mr . Weston ' s ball was to be a real thing .
It made him so very unhappy , indeed , that it could not be persevered in .
" What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be !
Mr . Weston was a great favourite , and there was not a creature in the world to whom she spoke with such unreserve , as to his wife ; not any one , to whom she related with such conviction of being listened to and understood , of being always interesting and always intelligible , the little affairs , arrangements , perplexities , and pleasures of her father and herself .
" So far as that it relates to Mr . Frank Churchill , I do guess ."
I have a great deal of vivacity in my own way , but I really must be allowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue .
" Oh !
" Yes ," said Mr . John Knightley presently , with some slyness , " he seems to have a great deal of good - will towards you ."
She blessed the favouring blindness .
" Mrs . Weston ' s manners ," said Emma , " were always particularly good .
Perhaps I may sometimes have felt that Harriet would not forget what was due -- or rather what would be kind by me ."
However , this does make a difference ; and , perhaps , when we come to talk it over -- but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration .
Perry ?-- Has he been here this morning ?-- And how does he travel now ?-- Has he set up his carriage ?"
I shall talk about it to him ; he will settle for me ; he will help me out of all my difficulties .'
He has been gone only four weeks ."
I think very well of Mr . Elton , and this is the only way I have of doing him a service ."
Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax .
here it is .
She was not obliged to hear .
It crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend ' s leaving Highbury , for the sake of her being settled so well .
.
Emma wondered on what , of all the medley , she would fix .
It was adventuring too far , assuming too much , making light of what ought to be serious , a trick of what ought to be simple .
At present , I ask only to hear , once to hear your voice ."
She is as low as possible .
" Oh !
Have patience with me , I shall soon have done .-- She closed with this offer , resolving to break with me entirely , and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again .-- _She_ _felt_ _the_ _engagement_ _to_ _be_ _a_ _source_ _of_ _repentance_ _and_ _misery_ _to_ _each_ : _she_ _dissolved_ _it_ .-- This letter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt ' s death .
" Well ," said she , " and you soon silenced Mr . Cole , I suppose ?"
Witness this very time .
They had received her doubtingly , if not coolly ; and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time -- till just at last , when Mrs . Martin ' s saying , all of a sudden , that she thought Miss Smith was grown , had brought on a more interesting subject , and a warmer manner .
That is what she writes about .
He walked off to find his father , but was quickly back again with both Mr . and Mrs . Weston .
" One more ;-- they would not fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account , and would only ask for one more ."
Mr . Weston , who had been a widower so long , and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife , so constantly occupied either in his business in town or among his friends here , always acceptable wherever he went , always cheerful -- Mr . Weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he did not like it .
Actually to discover that Mr . Knightley is a gentleman !
A _small_ half - glass , put into a tumbler of water ?
" I never had the smallest , I assure you ."
CHAPTER X
Somebody had placed her , several years back , at Mrs . Goddard ' s school , and somebody had lately raised her from the condition of scholar to that of parlour - boarder .
" Indeed , the truth was , that poor dear Jane could not bear to see any body -- any body at all -- Mrs . Elton , indeed , could not be denied -- and Mrs . Cole had made such a point -- and Mrs . Perry had said so much -- but , except them , Jane would really see nobody ."
A very proper compliment !-- and then follows the application , which I think , my dear Harriet , you cannot find much difficulty in comprehending .
Poor Miss Bates may very likely have committed her niece and hurried her into a greater appearance of intimacy than her own good sense would have dictated , in spite of the very natural wish of a little change ."
Mr . Knightley , always so kind , so feeling , so truly considerate for every body , would never deserve to be less worshipped than now ; and it really was too much to hope even of Harriet , that she could be in love with more than _three_ men in one year .
Well , ( returning to the room ,) I have not been able to succeed .
One is sick of the very name of Jane Fairfax .
I am sure , rather than run the risk of hurting Mr . and Mrs . Cole , you would stay a little longer than you might wish .
madness , if it is so ; but I hope you are mistaken ."
You were kept waiting at the door -- I was quite ashamed -- but somehow there was a little bustle -- for it so happened that we had not heard the knock , and till you were on the stairs , we did not know any body was coming .
How the trampers might have behaved , had the young ladies been more courageous , must be doubtful ; but such an invitation for attack could not be resisted ; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen children , headed by a stout woman and a great boy , all clamorous , and impertinent in look , though not absolutely in word .-- More and more frightened , she immediately promised them money , and taking out her purse , gave them a shilling , and begged them not to want more , or to use her ill .-- She was then able to walk , though but slowly , and was moving away -- but her terror and her purse were too tempting , and she was followed , or rather surrounded , by the whole gang , demanding more .
It would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance , which must have been the consequence of your marrying Mr . Martin .
" She had set out from Mrs . Goddard ' s half an hour ago -- she had been afraid it would rain -- she had been afraid it would pour down every moment -- but she thought she might get to Hartfield first -- she had hurried on as fast as possible ; but then , as she was passing by the house where a young woman was making up a gown for her , she thought she would just step in and see how it went on ; and though she did not seem to stay half a moment there , soon after she came out it began to rain , and she did not know what to do ; so she ran on directly , as fast as she could , and took shelter at Ford ' s ."
The plan of a drain , the change of a fence , the felling of a tree , and the destination of every acre for wheat , turnips , or spring corn , was entered into with as much equality of interest by John , as his cooler manners rendered possible ; and if his willing brother ever left him any thing to inquire about , his inquiries even approached a tone of eagerness .
" I either depend more upon Emma ' s good sense than you do , or am more anxious for her present comfort ; for I cannot lament the acquaintance .
" What two letters !-- express perfection !
Indeed , when the time draws on , I shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche - landau ; it will be so very much preferable .
By doing it , I shall feel that I am near you .
I was reading it to Mrs . Cole , and since she went away , I was reading it again to my mother , for it is such a pleasure to her -- a letter from Jane -- that she can never hear it often enough ; so I knew it could not be far off , and here it is , only just under my huswife -- and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she says ;-- but , first of all , I really must , in justice to Jane , apologise for her writing so short a letter -- only two pages you see -- hardly two -- and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half .
Your marrying will be equal to the match at Randalls .
Well , I wish them happy with all my heart .
" I assure you she did .
Miss Woodhouse !
