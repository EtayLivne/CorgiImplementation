Witness this very time .
He paused -- and growing cooler in a moment , added , with only sarcastic dryness , " If Mr . Perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty , I should be as willing to prefer Cromer to South End as he could himself ."
" Can you trust me with such flatterers ?-- Does my vain spirit ever tell me I am wrong ?"
those dear little children .
for the very moment Mr . Cole told Mrs . Cole of it , she sat down and wrote to me .
" I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter .
The horror of being blocked up at Randalls , while her children were at Hartfield , was full in her imagination ; and fancying the road to be now just passable for adventurous people , but in a state that admitted no delay , she was eager to have it settled , that her father and Emma should remain at Randalls , while she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them .
you forget yourself -- you take me for my friend -- any message to Miss Smith I shall be happy to deliver ; but no more of this to _me_ , if you please ."
Not a speck on them ."
" And I do envy him , Emma .
At one time Patty came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping .
The clock struck twelve as she passed through the hall .
Yes , I am sure you are much too reasonable .
-- and " Dear Miss Woodhouse ," was all that Harriet , with many tender embraces could articulate at first ; but when they did arrive at something more like conversation , it was sufficiently clear to her friend that she saw , felt , anticipated , and remembered just as she ought .
She opened the parlour door , and saw two gentlemen sitting with her father -- Mr . Weston and his son .
She was reminded , more than once , of having always said she would never marry , and assured that it would be a great deal better for her to remain single ; and told of poor Isabella , and poor Miss Taylor .-- But it would not do .
yes -- Mr . Knightley and I both saying we liked it , and Mr . Elton ' s seeming resolved to learn to like it too .
What is the foolish girl about ?"
" Dear me !
Do not tell his father , but that young man is not quite the thing .
Yes , good man !-- thought Emma -- but what has all that to do with taking likenesses ?
When I think of the kindness and favour I have met with , of her excellence and patience , and my uncle ' s generosity , I am mad with joy : but when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her , and how little I deserve to be forgiven , I am mad with anger .
Well , ( smiling ,) I hope it may be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers , it has done all that is truly important .
" I am ready ," said Emma , " whenever I am wanted ."
" It is a sort of thing ," cried Mrs . Elton emphatically , " which _I_ should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into .
For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself .
_We_ must begin ; we must go and pay wedding visit very soon ."
if you knew how much I love every thing that is decided and open !-- Good - bye , good - bye ."
Miss Woodhouse , do talk to me and make me comfortable again ."
He had caught both substance and shadow -- both fortune and affection , and was just the happy man he ought to be ; talking only of himself and his own concerns -- expecting to be congratulated -- ready to be laughed at -- and , with cordial , fearless smiles , now addressing all the young ladies of the place , to whom , a few weeks ago , he would have been more cautiously gallant .
said Emma , laughing .
-- thought Emma .--" You have not deserved this .
She saw that Enscombe could not satisfy , and that Highbury , taken at its best , might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement at home than he liked .
" Knightley !"
" A material difference then ," she replied --" and no doubt you were much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives ; but does not the lapse of one - and - twenty years bring our understandings a good deal nearer ?"
" _He_ is undoubtedly very much in love -- every thing denotes it -- very much in love indeed !-- and when he comes again , if his affection continue , I must be on my guard not to encourage it .-- It would be most inexcusable to do otherwise , as my own mind is quite made up .
She did not regret it .
" You like it , my Emma , as little as I feared .-- I wish our opinions were the same .
" Very true , my love , very true .
Emma was silenced .
" Mr . Knightley ," said Emma , trying to be lively , but really confused -- " I am in a very extraordinary situation .
She seemed bent on giving no real insight into Mr . Dixon ' s character , or her own value for his company , or opinion of the suitableness of the match .
" The Crown !"
A little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear .
" Yes , that of course ."
If I meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore , consider that point as settled ."
Elton ?"
She was a great talker upon little matters , which exactly suited Mr . Woodhouse , full of trivial communications and harmless gossip .
She had often observed the change , to almost the same extent .-- Harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him -- and Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had known of his opinion of Harriet .
I shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever I open my mouth , shan ' t I ?
Mr . Woodhouse was almost as glad to see him now , as he would have been sorry to see him before .
Tell me how Miss Fairfax is ."
This was so very well understood between them , that Emma could not but feel some surprise , and a little displeasure , on hearing from Mr . Weston that he had been proposing to Mrs . Elton , as her brother and sister had failed her , that the two parties should unite , and go together ; and that as Mrs . Elton had very readily acceded to it , so it was to be , if she had no objection .
As for _his_ going , Emma did not wish him to think it possible , the hours would be too late , and the party too numerous .
It is remarkable , that Emma , in the many , very many , points of view in which she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey , was never struck with any sense of injury to her nephew Henry , whose rights as heir - expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded .
" I do not know , my dear .
" I did ," replied Emma , " and they cannot forgive me ."
" That is as formidable an image as you could present , Harriet ; and if I thought I should ever be like Miss Bates !
The ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant , " Men never know when things are dirty or not ;" and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to himself , " Women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares ."
Mrs . Weston was acting no part , feigning no feelings in all that she said to him in favour of the event .-- She had been extremely surprized , never more so , than when Emma first opened the affair to her ; but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all , and had no scruple in urging him to the utmost .-- She had such a regard for Mr . Knightley , as to think he deserved even her dearest Emma ; and it was in every respect so proper , suitable , and unexceptionable a connexion , and in one respect , one point of the highest importance , so peculiarly eligible , so singularly fortunate , that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature , and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it , and wished it long ago .-- How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced their own home for Hartfield !
" I have not the least wish for it , I thank you ."
" Oh !
There had been no real affection either in his language or manners .
Emma began to listen better .
One man ' s style must not be the rule of another ' s .
No -- pray let her have time to look about her ."
It is my daily errand .
" Emma , my dear Emma --"
She was just as determined when the morrow came , and went early , that nothing might prevent her .
My dear Emma , we must consider this .
Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr . Woodhouse ' s family , less as a governess than a friend , very fond of both daughters , but particularly of Emma .
" Oh !
" How often we shall be going to see them , and they coming to see us !-- We shall be always meeting !
She must not make it a more decided subject of misery to him , by a melancholy tone herself .
She was wanting to see him again , and especially to see him in company with Mrs . Weston , upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him was to depend .
Kitty , a fair but frozen maid , Kindled a flame I yet deplore , The hood - wink ' d boy I called to aid , Though of his near approach afraid , So fatal to my suit before .
-- Then having recourse to her workbasket , in excuse for leaning down her face , and concealing all the exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be expressing , she added , " Well , now tell me every thing ; make this intelligible to me .
.
There was a communication before her , one which _she_ only could be competent to make -- the confession of her engagement to her father ; but she would have nothing to do with it at present .-- She had resolved to defer the disclosure till Mrs . Weston were safe and well .
The two eldest little Knightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of some weeks in the spring , and their papa now proposed bringing them , and staying one whole day at Hartfield -- which one day would be the very day of this party .-- His professional engagements did not allow of his being put off , but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happening so .
A mind lively and at ease , can do with seeing nothing , and can see nothing that does not answer .
They were combined only of anger against herself , mortification , and deep concern .
" The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me .
And Jane Fairfax , too , of all women !"
Were not you struck ?
I have not an idea -- I cannot guess it in the least .
" My father and Mrs . Weston are at the Crown at this moment ," said Frank Churchill , " examining the capabilities of the house .
" Oh !
" No , not at Randalls ; I have not been near Randalls ," when the door was thrown open , and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room .
Delightful , charming , superior , first circles , spheres , lines , ranks , every thing -- and Mrs . Elton was wild to have the offer closed with immediately .-- On her side , all was warmth , energy , and triumph -- and she positively refused to take her friend ' s negative , though Miss Fairfax continued to assure her that she would not at present engage in any thing , repeating the same motives which she had been heard to urge before .-- Still Mrs . Elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence by the morrow ' s post .-- How Jane could bear it at all , was astonishing to Emma .-- She did look vexed , she did speak pointedly -- and at last , with a decision of action unusual to her , proposed a removal .-- " Should not they walk ?
There will not be time for any thing ."
You never wrote a truer line ."
Some portion of respect for herself , however , in spite of all these demerits -- some concern for her own appearance , and a strong sense of justice by Harriet --( there would be no need of _compassion_ to the girl who believed herself loved by Mr . Knightley -- but justice required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now ,) gave Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness , with even apparent kindness .-- For her own advantage indeed , it was fit that the utmost extent of Harriet ' s hopes should be enquired into ; and Harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained -- or to deserve to be slighted by the person , whose counsels had never led her right .-- Rousing from reflection , therefore , and subduing her emotion , she turned to Harriet again , and , in a more inviting accent , renewed the conversation ; for as to the subject which had first introduced it , the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax , that was quite sunk and lost .-- Neither of them thought but of Mr . Knightley and themselves .
Mrs . Churchill , after being disliked at least twenty - five years , was now spoken of with compassionate allowances .
" That will never be , however , I can assure you .
` If _Miss_ _Taylor_ undertakes to wrap Miss Emma up , you need not have any fears , sir .'
Depend upon it he had encouragement ."
He was wishing to get the better of his attachment to herself , she just recovering from her mania for Mr . Elton .
Had he said any thing to bear a different construction , I should not have believed him ."
" My poor dear Isabella ," said he , fondly taking her hand , and interrupting , for a few moments , her busy labours for some one of her five children --" How long it is , how terribly long since you were here !
