I need not so totally despair of an equal alliance , as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith !-- No , madam , my visits to Hartfield have been for yourself only ; and the encouragement I received --"
You must go to bed early , my dear -- and I recommend a little gruel to you before you go .-- You and I will have a nice basin of gruel together .
The quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for Mr . Woodhouse , who had often been distressed by the more animated sort , which Mr . Weston had occasionally introduced , and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting , with tender melancholy , over the departure of the " poor little boys ," or in fondly pointing out , as he took up any stray letter near him , how beautifully Emma had written it .
" Both sir !
" But I thought you would .
She was very fond of singing .
It was felt as such things must be felt .
" Thank you .
Papa , do you not think it an excellent improvement ?"
" And , in return for your acknowledging so much , I will do you the justice to say , that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself .-- Harriet Smith has some first - rate qualities , which Mrs . Elton is totally without .
" That is very likely .
Mrs . Weston again , and again , and again , you see .
" Did you see her often at Weymouth ?
This was all very promising ; and , but for such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut , there was nothing to denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him ; the honour , if not of being really in love with her , of being at least very near it , and saved only by her own indifference -- ( for still her resolution held of never marrying )-- the honour , in short , of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance .
Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be very glad to marry him ."
" It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to , if Mr . and Mrs . Weston do not .
" Do you ?-- I have no doubt .
Oh !
While they talked , they were advancing towards the carriage ; it was ready ; and , before she could speak again , he had handed her in .
Her present home , he could not but observe , was unfavourable to a nervous disorder :-- confined always to one room ;-- he could have wished it otherwise -- and her good aunt , though his very old friend , he must acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description .
I hope they are quite well .
Bought at Weymouth , you know -- Mr . Dixon ' s choice .
" It is a sort of thing which nobody could have expected .
" Her friends must all be sorry to lose her ; and will not Colonel and Mrs . Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their return ?"
" Ah !"
" One ought to be at Enscombe , and know the ways of the family , before one decides upon what he can do ," replied Mrs . Weston .
She depended on the evil feelings of the Eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther requisite .-- Harriet rational , Frank Churchill not too much in love , and Mr . Knightley not wanting to quarrel with her , how very happy a summer must be before her !
Mrs . Goddard , what say you to _half_ a glass of wine ?
The same civilities and courtesies , the same success and satisfaction , took place on the morrow , and accompanied the whole progress of the picture , which was rapid and happy .
She rose early , and wrote her letter to Harriet ; an employment which left her so very serious , so nearly sad , that Mr . Knightley , in walking up to Hartfield to breakfast , did not arrive at all too soon ; and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him , literally and figuratively , was quite necessary to reinstate her in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before .
Elton ."
Adopt her , educate her ."
He had found her agitated and low .-- Frank Churchill was a villain .-- He heard her declare that she had never loved him .
" Do come with me ," said Mrs . Weston , " if it be not very disagreeable to you .
I have often talked to her a good deal .
I do not say when , but perhaps you may guess where ;-- in the building in which N . takes M . for better , for worse ."
I am sure I had much rather hear you .
" I should not wonder ," said Mrs . Weston , " if Miss Fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her own inclination , by her aunt ' s eagerness in accepting Mrs . Elton ' s civilities for her .
I would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else ; but you need not be afraid , they are very small , you see -- one of our small eggs will not hurt you .
So far from having long understood you , I have been in a most complete error with respect to your views , till this moment .
" Oh !
One takes up a notion , and runs away with it .
I hope it is a dry situation , and that her health will be taken good care of .
The prospect before her now , was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled -- that might not be even partially brightened .
" And here is Mrs . Weston and Mr . Frank Churchill too !-- Quite delightful ; so many friends !"
His professions and his proposals did him no service .
Miss Woodhouse !
As to any thing superior for you , I suppose she is quite in the dark .
" Yes ," replied Harriet modestly , but not fearfully --" I must say that I have ."
The contrivances of modern days indeed have rendered a gentleman ' s carriage perfectly complete .
" And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain .
" You get upon delicate subjects , Emma ," said Mrs . Weston smiling ; " remember that I am here .-- Mr .
" Business , you know , may bring money , but friendship hardly ever does ."
I really am ashamed of always leading the way ."
You will all be going soon I suppose ; the whole party breaking up .
Her second duty now , inferior only to her father ' s claims , was to promote Harriet ' s comfort , and endeavour to prove her own affection in some better method than by match - making .
I would give any money for it .
" Well ," said she to herself , " this is most strange !-- After I had got him off so well , to chuse to go into company , and leave Harriet ill behind !-- Most strange indeed !-- But there is , I believe , in many men , especially single men , such an inclination -- such a passion for dining out -- a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures , their employments , their dignities , almost their duties , that any thing gives way to it -- and this must be the case with Mr . Elton ; a most valuable , amiable , pleasing young man undoubtedly , and very much in love with Harriet ; but still , he cannot refuse an invitation , he must dine out wherever he is asked .
" Thank you ," said he , in an accent of deep mortification , and not another syllable followed .
" I have often thought them the worst of the two ," replied he coolly .
" So far as that it relates to Mr . Frank Churchill , I do guess ."
" I know nothing of the large parties of London , sir -- I never dine with any body ."
Invite them both ."
Well , time does fly indeed !-- and my memory is very bad .
" I must have asked Miss Fairfax , and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me , after your ' s ."
" A straightforward , open - hearted man like Weston , and a rational , unaffected woman like Miss Taylor , may be safely left to manage their own concerns .
Observe the turn of her throat .
had been a question of his .
He felt the going away almost too much to speak of it .
Men of sense , whatever you may chuse to say , do not want silly wives .
" Aye , that will be much best ," said Harriet , quite satisfied , " I should not at all like to have it sent to Mrs .
" Are you sure ?
There was deep consciousness about him , and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend ' s .
Men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity -- and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in , when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed .
Emma ' s politeness was at hand directly , to say , with smiling interest --
" Well , I am so sorry !-- Oh !
While either of them protected him and his , Hartfield was safe .-- But Mr . John Knightley must be in London again by the end of the first week in November .
" Yes , all of us ; Mrs . Elton would have us come .
" Oh !
Such language for a young man entirely dependent , to use !-- Nobody but you , Mr . Knightley , would imagine it possible .
What has Mr . Frank Churchill done , to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature ?"
" That is a grand pianoforte , and he might think it too large for Mrs . Bates ' s house ."
" My first enjoyment ," replied John Knightley , as they passed through the sweep - gate , " will be to find myself safe at Hartfield again ."
It was all right , all open , all equal .
The gruel came and supplied a great deal to be said -- much praise and many comments -- undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution , and pretty severe Philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with tolerable ;-- but , unfortunately , among the failures which the daughter had to instance , the most recent , and therefore most prominent , was in her own cook at South End , a young woman hired for the time , who never had been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel , thin , but not too thin .
" Yes , I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him ."
" Oh , the difference of situation and habit !
Oh !
They were rapidly forming words for each other , or for any body else who would be puzzled .
The chances are that she must be a gainer ."
Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own !
Ma ' am ," addressing her , " do you hear what Miss Woodhouse is so obliging to say about Jane ' s handwriting ?"
You cannot really , seriously , doubt it .
" He writes like a sensible man ," replied Emma , when she had read the letter .
She would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence , so justly and truly hers .
" Oh !
" Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love .
I should not attempt it , if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the Highbury people , but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path .
I promised my wife to leave it all to her .
She had a little beauty and a little accomplishment , but so little judgment that she thought herself coming with superior knowledge of the world , to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood ; and conceived Miss Hawkins to have held such a place in society as Mrs . Elton ' s consequence only could surpass .
