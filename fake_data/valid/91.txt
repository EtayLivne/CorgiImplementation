" Had you any idea ," cried Harriet , " of his being in love with her ?-- You , perhaps , might .-- You ( blushing as she spoke ) who can see into every body ' s heart ; but nobody else --"
cried Emma , collecting herself resolutely --" Let us understand each other now , without the possibility of farther mistake .
" Your word !-- why not your honour !-- why not say upon your honour , that it has nothing to do with any of them ?
" Dear me !-- How should I ever have borne it !
" Oh !
-- She did not suspect him .
" You are a very warm friend to Mr . Martin ; but , as I said before , are unjust to Harriet .
Emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as with Mr . Knightley .
One cannot creep upon a journey ; one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned ; and the pleasure of coming in upon one ' s friends before the look - out begins , is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs ."
Mrs . Weston was looking so ill , and had an air of so much perturbation , that Emma ' s uneasiness increased ; and the moment they were alone , she eagerly said ,
And ( raising his voice still more ) I do not see why Miss Fairfax should not be mentioned too .
She did not do any of it in the same way that she used ; I could see she was altered ; but , however , she seemed to _try_ to be very friendly , and we shook hands , and stood talking some time ; but I know no more what I said -- I was in such a tremble !-- I remember she said she was sorry we never met now ; which I thought almost too kind !
What a thinking brain you have !
" I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy ," said Mr . Knightley presently , " though I have kept my thoughts to myself ; but I now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet .
had been a question of his .
" That is very likely .
CHAPTER XVII
Wax - candles in the schoolroom !
Her caution was thrown away .
Decidedly , I think , a very gentleman - like man ."
It is fit that the fortune should be on his side , for I think the merit will be all on hers ."
Don ' t let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman ."
I had not thought of it before , but that is the best way .
His companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence , or smooth objections ; and by the time they had talked it all over together , and he had talked it all over again with Emma , in their walk back to Hartfield , he was become perfectly reconciled , and not far from thinking it the very best thing that Frank could possibly have done .
" And the next news , I suppose , will be , that we are to lose you -- just as I begin to know you ."
Mr . and Mrs . John Knightley were to come down in August , and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back .
This happened the night before last .
There is no admiration between them , I do assure you ; and the appearances which have caught you , have arisen from some peculiar circumstances -- feelings rather of a totally different nature -- it is impossible exactly to explain :-- there is a good deal of nonsense in it -- but the part which is capable of being communicated , which is sense , is , that they are as far from any attachment or admiration for one another , as any two beings in the world can be .
-- was a question , however , which did not augur much .
Perry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon South End ."
but why so ?-- I can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you , should not please and amuse me too ."
" They are blended ," said he , " I acknowledge ; and , were she prosperous , I could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over the good .
This was all very promising ; and , but for such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut , there was nothing to denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him ; the honour , if not of being really in love with her , of being at least very near it , and saved only by her own indifference -- ( for still her resolution held of never marrying )-- the honour , in short , of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance .
Woodhouse ?-- I am so glad to hear such a good account .
The gentlemen spoke of his horse .
` How could he contrive to come ?
We do not often look upon fine young men , well - bred and agreeable .
But from one cause or another , I gave it up in disgust .
" The post - office is a wonderful establishment !"
She saw in a moment all the possible good .
I promised my wife to leave it all to her .
Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax , escorted by the two gentlemen , walked into the room ; and Mrs . Elton seemed to think it as much her duty as Mrs . Weston ' s to receive them .
" I cannot rate her beauty as you do ," said he ; " but she is a pretty little creature , and I am inclined to think very well of her disposition .
She was short , plump , and fair , with a fine bloom , blue eyes , light hair , regular features , and a look of great sweetness , and , before the end of the evening , Emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person , and quite determined to continue the acquaintance .
You and Miss Fairfax gave us some very good music .
If Mr . Elton , on his return , made his own indifference as evident and indubitable as she could not doubt he would anxiously do , she could not imagine Harriet ' s persisting to place her happiness in the sight or the recollection of him .
She determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers .
said Miss Bates , joyfully ; " my mother is so pleased !-- she says she cannot bear to have the poor old Vicarage without a mistress .
A charming place , undoubtedly .
In the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast , that the party to Box Hill was again under happy consideration ; and at last Donwell was settled for one day , and Box Hill for the next ,-- the weather appearing exactly right .
Mrs . Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax ; and from the first .
This does not apply , however , to Miss Bates ; she is only too good natured and too silly to suit me ; but , in general , she is very much to the taste of every body , though single and though poor .
Her next beginning was ,
Where shall we see a better daughter , or a kinder sister , or a truer friend ?
She felt for Harriet , with pain and with contrition ; but no flight of generosity run mad , opposing all that could be probable or reasonable , entered her brain .
" Very like Maple Grove indeed !-- She was quite struck by the likeness !-- That room was the very shape and size of the morning - room at Maple Grove ; her sister ' s favourite room ."
Do not beat me ."
Where features were indifferent , a fine complexion gave beauty to them all ; and where they were good , the effect was -- fortunately he need not attempt to describe what the effect was .
It regarded a supper - room .
And is she , at seventeen , just entering into life , just beginning to be known , to be wondered at because she does not accept the first offer she receives ?
I believe I did not play with the children quite so much as usual .
Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be very glad to marry him ."
You are trying not to smile ."
yes , perfectly .-- Why do you make a doubt of it ?"
You must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other .
Who do you think is here ?-- Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith ; so kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte .
One could not leave her out ."
It seemed quite a shame , especially considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away .
You have been no friend to Harriet Smith , Emma .
You had better look about you , and ascertain what you do , and what you mean to do ."
A few minutes more , and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own house , to get sober and cool , and the other recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over .
Mr . Weston directed the whole , officiating safely between Hartfield and the Vicarage , and every body was in good time .
I was fatigued .
Harriet , here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good thoughts .
Mr . Woodhouse agreed to it all , but added ,
Whether he were overhearing too , she could not determine .
He could not understand it ; but there were symptoms of intelligence between them -- he thought so at least -- symptoms of admiration on his side , which , having once observed , he could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning , however he might wish to escape any of Emma ' s errors of imagination .
Her next beginning was ,
This will be complete enjoyment ; and I do not know , Mrs . Elton , whether the uncertainty of our meetings , the sort of constant expectation there will be of his coming in to - day or to - morrow , and at any hour , may not be more friendly to happiness than having him actually in the house .
At her age she can have no experience , and with her little wit , is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her .
" Very like Maple Grove indeed !-- She was quite struck by the likeness !-- That room was the very shape and size of the morning - room at Maple Grove ; her sister ' s favourite room ."
So she thought at first ;-- but a little consideration convinced her that every thing need not be put off .
Most comfortable carriage .-- Oh !
Jane Fairfax ' s perception seemed to accompany his ; her comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning , the superior intelligence , of those five letters so arranged .
Shall we walk , Augusta ?"
It was a private resolution of hers , not communicated to him -- or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction .-- Till yesterday , I know he said he was in the dark as to her plans .
I think you must know Hartfield enough to comprehend that ."
We shall soon overtake her .
I should be surprized if , after seeing them , you could be in company with Mr . Martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior creature -- and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before .
" It is a sort of thing ," cried Mrs . Elton emphatically , " which _I_ should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into .
If Jane does not get well soon , we will call in Mr . Perry .
" And I have not forgotten ," said Emma , " how sure you were that he might have come sooner if he would .
A circumstance rather unlucky occurred .
This was not submitted to by either lady .
It was his duty .
no -- I am grieved to find -- I was on the point of telling you that when I called at Mrs . Goddard ' s door , which I did the very last thing before I returned to dress , I was told that Miss Smith was not better , by no means better , rather worse .
She is not to pay for the offence of others , by being held below the level of those with whom she is brought up .-- There can scarcely be a doubt that her father is a gentleman -- and a gentleman of fortune .-- Her allowance is very liberal ; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfort .-- That she is a gentleman ' s daughter , is indubitable to me ; that she associates with gentlemen ' s daughters , no one , I apprehend , will deny .-- She is superior to Mr . Robert Martin ."
He had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted , and he could sometimes act an ungracious , or say a severe thing .
I could not bear it for Emma !-- Emma is not strong .
Emma soon recollected , and understood him ; and while she joined in the laugh , it was evident from Jane ' s countenance that she too was really hearing him , though trying to seem deaf .
