she cried , looking aghast .
" I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years ' experience , and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child .
" Nay , I had it from you .
Mrs . Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal of agitation herself ; and in the first place had wished not to go at all at present , to be allowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead , and to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed , and Mr . Churchill could be reconciled to the engagement ' s becoming known ; as , considering every thing , she thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports :-- but Mr . Weston had thought differently ; he was extremely anxious to shew his approbation to Miss Fairfax and her family , and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it ; or if it were , that it would be of any consequence ; for " such things ," he observed , " always got about ."
" You surprize me !
Elton !-- The stain of illegitimacy , unbleached by nobility or wealth , would have been a stain indeed .
" You have made her too tall , Emma ," said Mr . Knightley .
I should have expected better judgment in Colonel Campbell ."
if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax !"
--" The best of all .
" Be satisfied ," said he , " I will not raise any outcry .
I met _one_ as I came -- Madness in such weather !-- absolute madness !"
They sat down to tea -- the same party round the same table -- how often it had been collected !-- and how often had her eyes fallen on the same shrubs in the lawn , and observed the same beautiful effect of the western sun !-- But never in such a state of spirits , never in any thing like it ; and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house , or even the attentive daughter .
Don ' t let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman ."
There was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his side -- but no love .
-- She could really say nothing .--" You are silent ," he cried , with great animation ; " absolutely silent !
As Harriet now lived , the Martins could not get at her , without seeking her , where hitherto they had wanted either the courage or the condescension to seek her ; for since her refusal of the brother , the sisters never had been at Mrs . Goddard ' s ; and a twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again , with any necessity , or even any power of speech .
Consider what you are about .
The first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to attend , was the name of Jane Fairfax .
Some people were always cross when they were hot .
I only doubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else .
Your dear mother was so clever at all those things !
I dare not let my mother know how little she eats -- so I say one thing and then I say another , and it passes off .
Elton ."
To Miss --
It was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly recommending each to the other .
Now , however , we must wish you and Mrs . Bates good morning ."
I have another person ' s interest at present so much at heart , that I cannot think any longer about Frank Churchill .
But if she continued to play whenever she was asked by Mr . Dixon , one may guess what one chuses ."
Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell .
He has passed you very often ."
" To be sure ," said Harriet , in a mortified voice , " he is not so genteel as real gentlemen ."
The carriage -- we had disappointments about the carriage ;-- one morning , I remember , he came to me quite in despair ."
It was owing to _her_ persuasion , as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm .
.
We admired it so much , that I have ventured to write it into Miss Smith ' s collection .
Mr . John Knightley smiled , and replied ,
She could not endure to give him the true explanation ; for though her suspicions were by no means removed , she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them .
Harriet would be anxiety enough ; she need no longer be unhappy about Jane , whose troubles and whose ill - health having , of course , the same origin , must be equally under cure .-- Her days of insignificance and evil were over .-- She would soon be well , and happy , and prosperous .-- Emma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted .
" But I am afraid , Mr . Elton , Harriet will not like to sit .
Miss Woodhouse , what a pity that I must not write this beautiful charade into my book !
I shall sit by you .
Mrs . Churchill will not be second to any lady in the land for "--
said she : " did you ever sit for your picture ?"
If I could but have kept longer away !"
madam ," cried Emma , " if other children are at all like what I remember to have been myself , I should think five times the amount of what I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions , dearly earned ."
It is just what I used to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship , when , because things did not go quite right , did not proceed with all the rapidity which suited his feelings , he was apt to be in despair , and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be _May_ before Hymen ' s saffron robe would be put on for us .
" There is no saying , indeed ," replied Harriet rather solemnly .
I am glad he can afford it .
" I do not know which it ought to be called ."
Time , however , she thought , would tell him that they ought to be friends again .
Harriet was to sit again the next day ; and Mr . Elton , just as he ought , entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again .
That is , I _presume_ it to be so on her side , and I can _answer_ for its being so on his .
Every body in and about Highbury who had ever visited Mr . Elton , was disposed to pay him attention on his marriage .
She checked herself , however , and submitted quietly to a little more praise than she deserved .
I cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his side ; but I am sure there is a great wish on the Churchills ' to keep him to themselves .
I have no doubt of his having , at times , considerable influence ; but it may be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand _when_ it will be ."
was Mr . Woodhouse ' s first exclamation , and all that he could say for some time .
In so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her .
John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection , and Isabella always thinks as he does ; except when he is not quite frightened enough about the children .
Her friends evidently thought this good enough for her ; and it _was_ good enough .
But the case is altered now .
asked Mrs .
Something really important seemed announced by his looks ; but , as her friend was well , she endeavoured not to be uneasy , and settling it with her father , that she would take her walk now , she and Mr . Weston were soon out of the house together and on their way at a quick pace for Randalls .
" You were mentioning May .
I am sorry Mr . and Mrs . Cole should have done it .
I would not say so to every body , Mrs . Elton , but I have not much faith in Mrs . Churchill ' s illness ."
Her congratulations were warm and open ; but Emma could not speak so fluently .
Even this conquest would appear valuable in her eyes .
Colonel Campbell rather preferred an olive .
And to propose that she and I should unite to form a musical club !
He _had_ despaired at one period ; he had received such an injunction to caution and silence , as for the time crushed every hope ;-- she had begun by refusing to hear him .-- The change had perhaps been somewhat sudden ;-- her proposal of taking another turn , her renewing the conversation which she had just put an end to , might be a little extraordinary !-- She felt its inconsistency ; but Mr . Knightley was so obliging as to put up with it , and seek no farther explanation .
Is not that your idea ?"
" There is one subject ," he replied , " I hope but one , on which we do not think alike ."
" He trifles here ," said he , " as to the temptation .
Soon afterwards he began again ,
And , my dear , whenever he comes , you had better let him look at little Bella ' s throat ."
I hope you are quite well .
I did not know that I had fixed a day , but as he says I did , I am going now ."
Anywhere , so that Jane is not in a draught .
Harriet had business at Ford ' s .-- Emma thought it most prudent to go with her .
She was not less pleased another day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers , to have Harriet ' s picture .
Do you suppose she does not often say all this to herself ?
A better written letter , Harriet ( returning it ,) than I had expected ."
" If she is really ill , why not go to Bath , Mr .
Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed , without reproaches , or apparent sense of ill - usage ; and yet Emma fancied there was a something of resentment , a something bordering on it in her style , which increased the desirableness of their being separate .-- It might be only her own consciousness ; but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke .
Not to wait upon a bride is very remiss .
" I told you yesterday ," cried Mr . Weston with exultation , " I told you all that he would be here before the time named .
Mr . Elton and I are very good friends , and nothing more ;" and she walked on , amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances , of the mistakes which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into ; and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant , and in want of counsel .
regular features , open countenance , with a complexion !
In half a minute they were together .
When his letter to Mrs . Weston arrived , Emma had the perusal of it ; and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her at first shake her head over her own sensations , and think she had undervalued their strength .
The very next day however produced some proof of inspiration .
In no other light could you have been more to me than a common acquaintance .
" That ' s true ," she cried --" very true .
But you will do every thing right .
And here I can admit , that my manners to Miss W ., in being unpleasant to Miss F ., were highly blameable .
" You must make my apologies to your friend ; but so good a charade must not be confined to one or two .
We never were so long without seeing her before , and as I was telling Mrs . Cole , we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now ."
Another view of man , my second brings ; Behold him there , the monarch of the seas !
