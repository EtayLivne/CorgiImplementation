" Her friends must all be sorry to lose her ; and will not Colonel and Mrs . Campbell be sorry to find that she has engaged herself before their return ?"
cried his wife .--" My dear Mr . E ., you have not been to Donwell !-- You mean the Crown ; you come from the meeting at the Crown ."
Your friend will not take it amiss I hope .
" Ah !
Her nerves were under continual irritation and suffering ; and by the ten days ' end , her nephew ' s letter to Randalls communicated a change of plan .
" Emma !"
And then , her reserve -- I never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved ."
You will hardly believe me -- but twice in one week he and Mr . Bragge went to London and back again with four horses ."
" No ," said Emma , laughing ; " but perhaps there might be some made to his coming back again .
" Yes ," said he , smiling --" and reason good .
Selina is no fine lady , I assure you .
I am sorry for it .
" You surprize me !
It could be protracted no longer .
Weston ."
" To be sure .
I made the best excuses I could for not having been able to wait on him and Mrs . Elton on this happy occasion ; I said that I hoped I _should_ in the course of the summer .
And not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded .
" That appears quite wonderful .
They would feel that they could trust him ; that the nephew who had done rightly by his father , would do rightly by them ; for they know , as well as he does , as well as all the world must know , that he ought to pay this visit to his father ; and while meanly exerting their power to delay it , are in their hearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims .
I do not advise you to give way to it , Harriet .
" Aye -- like Maple Grove , I dare say .
she was not so easily to be talked out of it .
I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held ."
Highbury , that airy , cheerful , happy - looking Highbury , would be his constant attraction ."
She blessed the favouring blindness .
They had music ; Emma was obliged to play ; and the thanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her an affectation of candour , an air of greatness , meaning only to shew off in higher style her own very superior performance .
You know we have settled all that already .
" Cannot you , my dear Emma -- cannot you form a guess as to what you are to hear ?"
She was short , plump , and fair , with a fine bloom , blue eyes , light hair , regular features , and a look of great sweetness , and , before the end of the evening , Emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person , and quite determined to continue the acquaintance .
It was quite a chance , he said , that he had not gone round by Randalls .
Small heart had Harriet for visiting .
" Mr . Knightley ' s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare Mr . Martin with _him_ .
He was quite delighted .
He heard Frank Churchill next say , with a glance towards Jane , " I will give it to her -- shall I ?"
He paused .-- She coloured and laughed .--" I know you saw my letter , and think you may remember my wish in your favour .
After an interval of some minutes , however , he began with ,
" No , no ; your room is full enough .
I never heard any county but Surry called so ."
Her care and attention could not be questioned ; they were , in fact , only too great .
The present crisis , indeed , seemed to be brought on by them ; and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct ."
Jane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury , and was restored to the comforts of her beloved home with the Campbells .-- The Mr . Churchills were also in town ; and they were only waiting for November .
Mrs . Weston was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to her companion , pent up within her own mind as every thing had so long been , and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the subject .
Things must come to a crisis soon now .
" Yes -- I imagined -- that is -- I did not --"
" Do you think so ?"
was her immediate exclamation .
This is feeling your way .
But ah !
" Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed ," cried Emma .
Mrs . Weston , your argument weighs most with me .
Receive it on my judgment .
" No ,"-- replied Emma -- quite confirmed by the depressed manner in which he still spoke --" I should like to take another turn .
" Great has been the pleasure , I am sure .
Emma was rather in dismay when only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things , and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment .
What say you to Mr . Weston and Mr . Elton ?
" It is Frank and Miss Fairfax ," said Mrs . Weston .
While he was so dull , it was no wonder that Harriet should be dull likewise ; and they were both insufferable .
The wedding was very much like other weddings , where the parties have no taste for finery or parade ; and Mrs . Elton , from the particulars detailed by her husband , thought it all extremely shabby , and very inferior to her own .--" Very little white satin , very few lace veils ; a most pitiful business !-- Selina would stare when she heard of it ."
She blessed the favouring blindness .
Little things do not irritate him .
My poor mother does not know how to bear it .
I can imagine , that before she had seen any body superior , she might tolerate him .
you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate ."
They must not over - salt the leg ; and then , if it is not over - salted , and if it is very thoroughly boiled , just as Serle boils ours , and eaten very moderately of , with a boiled turnip , and a little carrot or parsnip , I do not consider it unwholesome ."
" Agreed , agreed .
I remember saying to myself , ` Even Emma , with all her partiality for Harriet , will think this a good match .'"
Find some body for me .
She was stopped by a slight fit of coughing , and Mr . Weston instantly seized the opportunity of going on .
you are too obliging !
The subject followed ; it was in plain , unaffected , gentlemanlike English , such as Mr . Knightley used even to the woman he was in love with , how to be able to ask her to marry him , without attacking the happiness of her father .
Can I do any thing for you ?"
At first , while I supposed you satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver , I saw it only as paternal kindness , and thought it the most natural thing in the world .
I dare say they often think of you , and wonder which will be the day , the precise day of the instrument ' s coming to hand .
When they had all talked a little while in harmony of the weather and Mrs . Weston , she found herself abruptly addressed with ,
She had a little beauty and a little accomplishment , but so little judgment that she thought herself coming with superior knowledge of the world , to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood ; and conceived Miss Hawkins to have held such a place in society as Mrs . Elton ' s consequence only could surpass .
Her good - nature , too , is not so very slight a claim , comprehending , as it does , real , thorough sweetness of temper and manner , a very humble opinion of herself , and a great readiness to be pleased with other people .
He did not advance a word of praise beyond what she knew to be thoroughly deserved by Mrs . Weston ; but , undoubtedly he could know very little of the matter .
" No ," cried Mr . Knightley , " that need not be the consequence .
" It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy , but I cannot believe it .
Fortune I do not want ; employment I do not want ; consequence I do not want : I believe few married women are half as much mistress of their husband ' s house as I am of Hartfield ; and never , never could I expect to be so truly beloved and important ; so always first and always right in any man ' s eyes as I am in my father ' s ."
CHAPTER XVIII
He had wanted very much to go abroad -- had been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel -- but she would not hear of it .
What an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream !
" They are blended ," said he , " I acknowledge ; and , were she prosperous , I could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over the good .
So then , I try to put it out of her thoughts , and say , Come ma ' am , do not let us think about it any more ."
" And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain .
that is quite surprising , for we have had a vast deal of rain here .
And he was really a very pleasing young man , a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like .
A situation such as you deserve , and your friends would require for you , is no everyday occurrence , is not obtained at a moment ' s notice ; indeed , indeed , we must begin inquiring directly ."
He was on the move immediately ; but coming back , said ,
she was going to exclaim ; but she presently found that it was a family of old friends , who were coming , like herself , by particular desire , to help Mr . Weston ' s judgment ; and they were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins , who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness , on the same errand , that it seemed as if half the company might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection .
" To be sure ," said Harriet , in a mortified voice , " he is not so genteel as real gentlemen ."
" But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax !"
Emma ' s first resolution was to keep her father from the knowledge of what had passed ,-- aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion : but she soon felt that concealment must be impossible .
In one respect Mrs . Elton grew even worse than she had appeared at first .
It must not be : and yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance !--
" The sooner every party breaks up , the better ."
Whenever you are transplanted , like me , Miss Woodhouse , you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind .
The compliments of his neighbours were over ; he was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event ; and the wedding - cake , which had been a great distress to him , was all eat up .
