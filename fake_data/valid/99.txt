South End is an unhealthy place .
And , upon my word , I do not think Mr . Knightley would be much disturbed by Miss Bates .
" Oh yes !-- there is a great difference .
He was on the move immediately ; but coming back , said ,
It might be weeks , it might be only a few days , before the horse were useable ; but no preparations could be ventured on , and it was all melancholy stagnation .
He called her ` Augusta .'
In so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her .
He could be no judge , however , of the evil he was holding cheap .
They have no mercy on her ."
She might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments .
She was obliged , in spite of her previous determination to the contrary , to do it all the justice that Mrs . Weston foretold .
Perry ?-- Has he been here this morning ?-- And how does he travel now ?-- Has he set up his carriage ?"
I give you this caution now , because I shall never speak to you again on the subject .
Let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of .
Could I mention any thing more fit to be done , than to go to Mrs . Goddard ?
" Six years hence !
Mrs . Weston was disengaged and Emma began again --" Mr . Frank Churchill writes one of the best gentleman ' s hands I ever saw ."
" If not in our dispositions ," she presently added , with a look of true sensibility , " there is a likeness in our destiny ; the destiny which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own ."
She was in no hurry at all .
Harriet , necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the Martins , was less and less at Hartfield ; which was not to be regretted .-- The intimacy between her and Emma must sink ; their friendship must change into a calmer sort of goodwill ; and , fortunately , what ought to be , and must be , seemed already beginning , and in the most gradual , natural manner .
who can think of Miss Smith , when Miss Woodhouse is near !
She was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke , and opening the casement there , immediately called Mr . Knightley ' s attention , and every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others , as if it had passed within the same apartment .
I am sure I do not know ."
They had gone , in short -- and very great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady .
" Nay , I had it from you .
She would keep the peace if possible ; and there was something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits , the all - sufficiency of home to himself , whence resulted her brother ' s disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse , and those to whom it was important .-- It had a high claim to forbearance .
I like him very much .
Mrs . Smallridge is in a great hurry .
Emma restrained her indignation , and only turned from her in silence .
While you were in the smallest degree wavering , I said nothing about it , because I would not influence ; but it would have been the loss of a friend to me .
Indeed they are very delightful apples , and Mrs . Wallis does them full justice -- only we do not have them baked more than twice , and Mr . Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times -- but Miss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it .
That is , _I_ always had a strong persuasion he would be here again soon , I was sure something favourable would turn up -- but nobody believed me .
Here are seven of you , besides myself , ( who , she is pleased to say , am very entertaining already ,) and she only demands from each of you either one thing very clever , be it prose or verse , original or repeated -- or two things moderately clever -- or three things very dull indeed , and she engages to laugh heartily at them all ."
Had you not been surrounded by other friends , I might have been tempted to introduce a subject , to ask questions , to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct .-- I feel that I should certainly have been impertinent ."
They lived beyond their income , but still it was nothing in comparison of Enscombe : she did not cease to love her husband , but she wanted at once to be the wife of Captain Weston , and Miss Churchill of Enscombe .
The same civilities and courtesies , the same success and satisfaction , took place on the morrow , and accompanied the whole progress of the picture , which was rapid and happy .
I shall wear a large bonnet , and bring one of my little baskets hanging on my arm .
It might be a very indifferent piece of wit , but Emma found a great deal to laugh at and enjoy in it -- and so did Frank and Harriet .-- It did not seem to touch the rest of the party equally ; some looked very stupid about it , and Mr . Knightley gravely said ,
" Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ ," said Frank Churchill , with a smile at Emma , " the person has not chosen ill .
I should have expected better judgment in Colonel Campbell ."
Emma had not had time even to think of Mr . Elton , and she was so completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start , and a little blush , at the sound .
I can hardly imagine the young man whom I saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well , if left quite to his own powers , and yet it is not the style of a woman ; no , certainly , it is too strong and concise ; not diffuse enough for a woman .
Mr . Knightley and Harriet Smith !-- It was a union to distance every wonder of the kind .-- The attachment of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax became commonplace , threadbare , stale in the comparison , exciting no surprize , presenting no disparity , affording nothing to be said or thought .-- Mr .
I have a great deal of vivacity in my own way , but I really must be allowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue .
How very differently we feel !-- Not think they will do each other any good !
The couplet does not cease to be , nor does its meaning change .
I shall think you a great blockhead , Frank , if you bring the aunt without the niece ."
Alas !
Then the baked apples came home , Mrs . Wallis sent them by her boy ; they are extremely civil and obliging to us , the Wallises , always -- I have heard some people say that Mrs . Wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer , but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention from them .
Mr . Knightley saw no such passion , and of course thought nothing of its effects ; but she saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest ; and more than a reasonable , becoming degree of prudence , she was very sure did not belong to Mr . Elton .
" Such sweet lines !"
" Whom are you going to dance with ?"
Miss Woodhouse , the comfort of being sometimes alone !"
Certainly his being at Randalls had given great spirit to the last two weeks -- indescribable spirit ; the idea , the expectation of seeing him which every morning had brought , the assurance of his attentions , his liveliness , his manners !
Her height was pretty , just such as almost every body would think tall , and nobody could think very tall ; her figure particularly graceful ; her size a most becoming medium , between fat and thin , though a slight appearance of ill - health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two .
I shall have no difficulty , I suppose , in finding the house ; though Fairfax , I believe , is not the proper name -- I should rather say Barnes , or Bates .
The shower was heavy , but short ; and it had not been over five minutes , when in came Harriet , with just the heated , agitated look which hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give ; and the " Oh !
Not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to recommend the other , but from the very first ; and she was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration -- but without solicitation , or plea , or privilege , she must be wanting to assist and befriend her .-- Before Emma had forfeited her confidence , and about the third time of their meeting , she heard all Mrs . Elton ' s knight - errantry on the subject .--
" My picture !-- But he has left my picture in Bond - street ."
She was aware herself , that , parting under any other circumstances , they certainly should have corresponded more , and that her intelligence would not have rested , as it now almost wholly did , on Isabella ' s letters .
Mrs . Dixon , I understand , has no remarkable degree of personal beauty ; is not , by any means , to be compared with Miss Fairfax ."
my dear , it is not like Hartfield .
I am sure I do not know who is not ."
They must encounter each other , and make the best of it .
Knightley ."
We always say what we like to one another ."
I was quite surprized ;-- very glad , I am sure ; but really quite surprized .
He said , from the first , it was a very good sort -- which was our great comfort ; but the measles are a dreadful complaint .
It is always the lady ' s right to decide on the degree of acquaintance .
The only thing I do not thoroughly like is , that she seems to be sitting out of doors , with only a little shawl over her shoulders -- and it makes one think she must catch cold ."
South End is prohibited , if you please .
I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction , comfort , and delight to me , to hear what a musical society I am got into .
" He was four - and - twenty the 8th of last June , and my birthday is the 23rd just a fortnight and a day ' s difference -- which is very odd ."
The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose any body to .
The mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr . Elton .
Emma was not thinking of it at the moment , which made the information she received more valuable .
Gilbert would have danced the other evening , if she had been asked .
She read it to him , just as he liked to have any thing read , slowly and distinctly , and two or three times over , with explanations of every part as she proceeded -- and he was very much pleased , and , as she had foreseen , especially struck with the complimentary conclusion .
How the trampers might have behaved , had the young ladies been more courageous , must be doubtful ; but such an invitation for attack could not be resisted ; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen children , headed by a stout woman and a great boy , all clamorous , and impertinent in look , though not absolutely in word .-- More and more frightened , she immediately promised them money , and taking out her purse , gave them a shilling , and begged them not to want more , or to use her ill .-- She was then able to walk , though but slowly , and was moving away -- but her terror and her purse were too tempting , and she was followed , or rather surrounded , by the whole gang , demanding more .
" She is not entirely without it , I think ."
She had not been able to speak ; and , on entering the carriage , sunk back for a moment overcome -- then reproaching herself for having taken no leave , making no acknowledgment , parting in apparent sullenness , she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference ; but it was just too late .
Some people even talked of a promise to his wife on her deathbed , and others of the son and the uncle not letting him .
They can do nothing satisfactorily without you ."
She was pleased , on taking leave , to find Miss Fairfax determined to attend her out of the room , to go with her even downstairs ; it gave her an opportunity which she immediately made use of , to say ,
" Oh !"
It would only be giving trouble and distress .
Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could , to keep him from such thoughts ; but when tea came , it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner ,
certainly not too tall ; not in the least too tall .
Respect would be added to affection .
" To think of your sending us all your store apples .
Indeed you should take care of yourself as well as of your friend .
Dixon .-- Very well .
To do what would be most generally pleasing must be our object -- if one could but tell what that would be ."
" You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill , I presume ," he continued -- " and know him to be my son , though he does not bear my name ."
Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business to be going forward just at this time ?-- Do you imagine it to be the consequence of an immediate commission from him , or that he may have sent only a general direction , an order indefinite as to time , to depend upon contingencies and conveniences ?"
The two eldest little Knightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of some weeks in the spring , and their papa now proposed bringing them , and staying one whole day at Hartfield -- which one day would be the very day of this party .-- His professional engagements did not allow of his being put off , but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happening so .
He knows he is wrong , and has nothing rational to urge .-- Bad .-- He ought not to have formed the engagement .--` His father ' s disposition :'-- he is unjust , however , to his father .
" I mentioned no _names_ , you will observe .-- Oh !
Such a change !
And besides the operation of this , as a general principle , you may be sure that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs . Elton by her superiority both of mind and manner ; and that , face to face , Mrs . Elton treats her with all the respect which she has a claim to .
