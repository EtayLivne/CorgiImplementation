" Well , Mrs . Weston ," said Emma triumphantly when he left them , " what do you say now to Mr . Knightley ' s marrying Jane Fairfax ?"
how peculiarly unprepared I was !-- for I had reason to believe her very lately more determined against him , much more , than she was before ."
Your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave England ."
But then there is not so clever a man any where ."
" Poor Mrs . Churchill !
" But your father is not going so far ; he is only going to the Crown , quite on the other side of the street , and there are a great many houses ; you might be very much at a loss , and it is a very dirty walk , unless you keep on the footpath ; but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street ."
There will be enough for every hope and every fear ; and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent , it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder .
Oh yes !
When he was again in their company , he could not help remembering what he had seen ; nor could he avoid observations which , unless it were like Cowper and his fire at twilight ,
" Thank you for rousing me ," he replied .
Dear Harriet , I give myself joy of this .
Tell me , I charge you tell me this moment what it is ."
She was most forcibly struck .
_She_ was a little occupied in weighing her own feelings , and trying to understand the degree of her agitation , which she rather thought was considerable .
The most satisfactory comparisons were rising in her mind .
" Aye , _that_ may suit your humble ideas of yourself ;-- I know what a modest creature you are ; but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any thing that may offer , any inferior , commonplace situation , in a family not moving in a certain circle , or able to command the elegancies of life ."
I wanted to know a little more , and this tells me quite enough .
That is _ship_ ;-- plain as it can be .-- Now for the cream .
He began with great earnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick - chamber again , for the present -- to entreat her to _promise_ _him_ not to venture into such hazard till he had seen Mr . Perry and learnt his opinion ; and though she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course , there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude about her .
I hope you will think better of their looks to - morrow ; for I assure you Mr . Wingfield told me , that he did not believe he had ever sent us off altogether , in such good case .
Where is it ?
It was owing to _her_ persuasion , as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm .
With some there was great joy at the sight of Frank Churchill ; others took it very composedly ; but there was a very general distress and disturbance on Miss Fairfax ' s disappearance being explained .
repeated Emma .
He wanted to marry well , and having the arrogance to raise his eyes to her , pretended to be in love ; but she was perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for .
I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point .
She is staying here on a visit to her grandmama and aunt , very worthy people ; I have known them all my life .
Mrs . Elton , as elegant as lace and pearls could make her , he looked at in silence -- wanting only to observe enough for Isabella ' s information -- but Miss Fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl , and he could talk to her .
But poor Mrs . Bates had a bad cold about a month ago ."
Come , sir , pray let me hear it ."
She had not been able to speak ; and , on entering the carriage , sunk back for a moment overcome -- then reproaching herself for having taken no leave , making no acknowledgment , parting in apparent sullenness , she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference ; but it was just too late .
" She has had the advantage , you know , of practising on me ," she continued --" like La Baronne d ' Almane on La Comtesse d ' Ostalis , in Madame de Genlis ' Adelaide and Theodore , and we shall now see her own little Adelaide educated on a more perfect plan ."
here it comes .
He gave her a letter , it was from Frank , and to herself ; he had met with it in his way , and had taken the liberty of opening it .
She would have ordered the carriage , and come to you , but she must see you _alone_ , and that you know --( nodding towards her father )-- Humph !-- Can you come ?"
" Upon my word , Emma ."
He seemed by this connexion between the families , quite to belong to her .
She had heard , as soon as she got back to Mrs . Goddard ' s , that Mr . Martin had been there an hour before , and finding she was not at home , nor particularly expected , had left a little parcel for her from one of his sisters , and gone away ; and on opening this parcel , she had actually found , besides the two songs which she had lent Elizabeth to copy , a letter to herself ; and this letter was from him , from Mr . Martin , and contained a direct proposal of marriage .
But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss Fairfax , I never could , under any blunder , have spoken ill of her ; and as to speaking ill of him , there I must have been safe ."
Heavens !
Why she did not like Jane Fairfax might be a difficult question to answer ; Mr . Knightley had once told her it was because she saw in her the really accomplished young woman , which she wanted to be thought herself ; and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time , there were moments of self - examination in which her conscience could not quite acquit her .
he is off .
John Knightley only was in mute astonishment .-- That a man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a day of business in London , should set off again , and walk half a mile to another man ' s house , for the sake of being in mixed company till bed - time , of finishing his day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers , was a circumstance to strike him deeply .
But hardly had she so spoken , when she found her brother was civilly offering a seat in his carriage , if the weather were Mr . Elton ' s only objection , and Mr . Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction .
She could think of nothing better : and though there was something in it which her own heart could not approve -- something of ingratitude , merely glossed over -- it must be done , or what would become of Harriet ?
But the question is not , whether it would be a bad connexion for him , but whether he wishes it ; and I think he does .
" We must ask Mr . and Mrs . Weston to dine with us , while Isabella is here ."
I am sure she will be pleased with the children .
Emma thought first of herself , and then of Harriet .
It would have killed me never to come to Hartfield any more !"
And then , her reserve -- I never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved ."
How delightful !"
" Ah !
Martin ?"
" It is so cold , so very cold -- and looks and feels so very much like snow , that if it were to any other place or with any other party , I should really try not to go out to - day -- and dissuade my father from venturing ; but as he has made up his mind , and does not seem to feel the cold himself , I do not like to interfere , as I know it would be so great a disappointment to Mr . and Mrs . Weston .
the best nature in the world -- a wedding ."
" You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs . Weston for my feelings ," said Emma ; " were you to guess her to be _eighteen_ , I should listen with pleasure ; but _she_ would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words .
Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be expected ; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits , which appeared perfectly natural , as there was a dentist to be consulted ; but , since that business had been over , she did not appear to find Harriet different from what she had known her before .-- Isabella , to be sure , was no very quick observer ; yet if Harriet had not been equal to playing with the children , it would not have escaped her .
There , not to be vulgar , was distinction , and merit .
This was the only visit from Frank Churchill in the course of ten days .
It will be felt so great an attention !
She has been so kind as to promise it .
In time , of course , Mr . Knightley would be forgotten , that is , supplanted ; but this could not be expected to happen very early .
Mrs . Weston was looking so ill , and had an air of so much perturbation , that Emma ' s uneasiness increased ; and the moment they were alone , she eagerly said ,
And she leaned back in the corner , to indulge her murmurs , or to reason them away ; probably a little of both -- such being the commonest process of a not ill - disposed mind .
" I am glad I have done being in love with him .
Absence , with the conviction probably of her indifference , had produced this very natural and very desirable effect .
no , upon my word I have not the smallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body .
Jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour , and they had only accomplished some views of St . Mark ' s Place , Venice , when Frank Churchill entered the room .
" Yes ," said Harriet earnestly , " and well she might , nobody could ever have a better .
" That is what you have in your head , I know -- and what you would certainly say if my father were not by ."
What were nine miles to a young man ?-- An hour ' s ride .
It spoke such perfect amity .-- He left them immediately afterwards -- gone in a moment .
I am sure , a month ago , I had no more idea myself !-- The strangest things do take place !"
He could say no more ; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him , returned with Mrs . Weston to Mrs . Bates ' s door .
When Mr . Weston joined the party , however , and when the baby was fetched , there was no longer a want of subject or animation -- or of courage and opportunity for Frank Churchill to draw near her and say ,
" You are very obliging .-- Frank will be extremely happy , I am sure .-- He is to be in town next week , if not sooner .
" I have some hope ," resumed he , " of my uncle ' s being persuaded to pay a visit at Randalls ; he wants to be introduced to her .
But this does not acquit _him_ , Mrs . Weston ; and I must say , that I think him greatly to blame .
Jane ' s alertness in moving , proved her as ready as her aunt had preconceived .
Had it taken place only once a year , it would have been a grievance .
The move began ; and Miss Bates might be heard from that moment , without interruption , till her being seated at table and taking up her spoon .
Mrs . Weston ' s communications furnished Emma with more food for unpleasant reflection , by increasing her esteem and compassion , and her sense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax .
I always stand up for women -- and I assure you , if you knew how Selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn , you would not wonder at Mrs . Churchill ' s making incredible exertions to avoid it .
Either because he did not dance himself , or because the plan had been formed without his being consulted , he seemed resolved that it should not interest him , determined against its exciting any present curiosity , or affording him any future amusement .
I believe he is one of the very best - tempered men that ever existed .
She seems quite recovered now .
Emma was silenced .
There is my father -- another of my father -- but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous , that I could only take him by stealth ; neither of them very like therefore .
When I think of the kindness and favour I have met with , of her excellence and patience , and my uncle ' s generosity , I am mad with joy : but when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her , and how little I deserve to be forgiven , I am mad with anger .
" So do I ," said Mrs . Weston gently , " very much ."
Harriet was not insensible of manner ; she had voluntarily noticed her father ' s gentleness with admiration as well as wonder .
" What did Mr . Weston tell you ?"
With their wealth , their views increased ; their want of a larger house , their inclination for more company .
And he was really a very pleasing young man , a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like .
" Well done , Mrs .
My dear Emma , we must consider this .
what would Frank Churchill say to her , if he were here ?
I should not mind walking half the way .
" What did Mr . Weston tell you ?"
