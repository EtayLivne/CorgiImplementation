A few more to - morrows , and the party from London would be arriving .
He is generally thought a fine young man , but do not expect a prodigy .
made her quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some pages ago already .
" But she is so fond of the nephew : he is so very great a favourite .
I hope he will be calling soon .
" My dear Emma ," said he , moving from his chair into one close by her , " you are not going to tell me , I hope , that you had not a pleasant evening ."
That will be a much better thing .
A few more to - morrows , and the party from London would be arriving .
There cannot be two opinions about _him_ .
She has been so kind as to promise it .
Emma thought at least it would turn out so .
I do not see it ."
" Oh !
Never had she felt so agitated , mortified , grieved , at any circumstance in her life .
Call upon her , by all means ."
" I do think it is , without exception , the best charade I ever read ."
Such a sad loss to our party to - day !"
We must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the bargain .
She was your governess , I think ?"
I have no business to put myself forward ."
Frank ' s was the first idea ; and his the greatest zeal in pursuing it ; for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties , and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance .
And how much may be said in her situation for even that error !"
Compare their manner of carrying themselves ; of walking ; of speaking ; of being silent .
He had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted , and her tongue motionless .
Where is she ?-- Oh !
She saw it all ; and entering into her feelings , promoted her quitting the house immediately , and watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend .
" And no great harm if it does ," said Mr . Woodhouse .
" You understand the force of influence pretty well , Harriet ; but I would have you so firmly established in good society , as to be independent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse .
" But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so soon , though he does .
.
I hope not of a putrid infectious sort .
Let them be sent to Donwell .
She had heard and seen it all ; and felt some curiosity to know whether the wet walk of this morning had produced any .
" I never should have presumed to think of it at first ," said she , " but for you .
It was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits .
He could not be persuaded that so many good - looking houses as he saw around him , could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting ; and even when particulars were given and families described , he was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing , or that there would be the smallest difficulty in every body ' s returning into their proper place the next morning .
Unwelcome as it was , Mr . Woodhouse could only give a submissive sigh ; and as Emma saw his spirits affected by the idea of his daughter ' s attachment to her husband , she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them .
Another song , however , was soon begged for .
she is absolutely charming !
He is an excellent young man , both as son and brother .
" Mr . Knightley ," said Emma , trying to be lively , but really confused -- " I am in a very extraordinary situation .
I dare say my daughter will be here presently , Miss Woodhouse .
But there was no doing any thing , with Mr . Elton fidgeting behind her and watching every touch .
She supposed she must say more before she were entitled to his clemency ; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in his opinion .
One feels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance .
She recovered her voice .
Always the first person to be thought of !
She could see nothing but evil in it .
It must be all conjecture ."
" I never read one more to the purpose , certainly ."
There was not a dissentient voice on the subject , either when Mrs . Perry drank tea with Mrs . and Miss Bates , or when Mrs . and Miss Bates returned the visit .
" He has not been here yet ," replied Emma .
I am in no hurry .
She is not the superior young woman which Emma ' s friend ought to be .
Mr . Knightley , who had nothing of ceremony about him , was offering by his short , decided answers , an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and civil hesitations of the other .
In the warmth of true contrition , she would call upon her the very next morning , and it should be the beginning , on her side , of a regular , equal , kindly intercourse .
You will not regard being tired .
You never wrote a truer line ."
Harriet turned away ; but Emma could receive him with the usual smile , and her quick eye soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a push -- of having thrown a die ; and she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up .
" What !"
I can imagine , that if you , as you are , Mr . Knightley , were to be transported and placed all at once in Mr . Frank Churchill ' s situation , you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him ; and it might have a very good effect .
Time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circle -- but that is not the change I had in view for you .
She believed he had been drinking too much of Mr . Weston ' s good wine , and felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense .
What shall I say ?"
Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust to people of that sort ; for there is a family in that neighbourhood who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give themselves !
Mr . Elton was the only one whose assistance she asked .
I hope you will think better of their looks to - morrow ; for I assure you Mr . Wingfield told me , that he did not believe he had ever sent us off altogether , in such good case .
I see nobody else looking like her !-- I must go and ask her whether it is an Irish fashion .
She was short , plump , and fair , with a fine bloom , blue eyes , light hair , regular features , and a look of great sweetness , and , before the end of the evening , Emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person , and quite determined to continue the acquaintance .
Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess , the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint ; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away , they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached , and Emma doing just what she liked ; highly esteeming Miss Taylor ' s judgment , but directed chiefly by her own .
" If you please , my dear .
" Middling , my dear ; I cannot compliment you .
But is not this a sudden scheme ?"
Whenever you are transplanted , like me , Miss Woodhouse , you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind .
The room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied , and looking forwards ; behind it was another with which it immediately communicated ; the door between them was open , and Emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner .
Emma waited the result with impatience , but not without strong hopes .
I should not wonder if it were to bring on the declaration .
Having arranged all these matters , looked them through , and put them all to rights , she was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up for the demands of the two little boys , as well as of their grandpapa , when the great iron sweep - gate opened , and two persons entered whom she had never less expected to see together -- Frank Churchill , with Harriet leaning on his arm -- actually Harriet !-- A moment sufficed to convince her that something extraordinary had happened .
Emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey ; and walking a few yards forward , while they talked together , soon made her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with Mr . Robert Martin .
cried he , looking eagerly at her , " are you , indeed ?"
" Here ," resumed Harriet , turning to her box again , " here is something still more valuable , I mean that _has_ _been_ more valuable , because this is what did really once belong to him , which the court - plaister never did ."
Harriet was silent .
The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed ; and here were a few difficulties .
I give you this caution now , because I shall never speak to you again on the subject .
` Can I do any thing for you at Kingston ?'
" Nonsense !
Like him , she had tried the scheme and rejected it ; but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her .
They had not intended to go over till the summer , but she is so impatient to see them again -- for till she married , last October , she was never away from them so much as a week , which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms , I was going to say , but however different countries , and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her mother -- or her father , I declare I do not know which it was , but we shall see presently in Jane ' s letter -- wrote in Mr . Dixon ' s name as well as her own , to press their coming over directly , and they would give them the meeting in Dublin , and take them back to their country seat , Baly - craig , a beautiful place , I fancy .
" And who do you think came in while we were there ?"
They had stopped at Mrs . Bates ' s door to offer the use of their carriage , but the aunt and niece were to be brought by the Eltons .
You must grant me that ."
Emma must do Harriet good : and by supplying her with a new object of interest , Harriet may be said to do Emma good .
Her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits , inconsistency of action , and inequality of powers ; and it mortified her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling , or esteemed so little worthy as a friend : but she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good , and of being able to say to herself , that could Mr . Knightley have been privy to all her attempts of assisting Jane Fairfax , could he even have seen into her heart , he would not , on this occasion , have found any thing to reprove .
He seems every thing the fondest parent could .
you answer as discreetly as she could do herself .
" I either depend more upon Emma ' s good sense than you do , or am more anxious for her present comfort ; for I cannot lament the acquaintance .
" Mrs . Elton , I suppose , has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax owes --"
Harriet exactly .
" I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case ," replied Emma ; " but am disposed to side with you , Mr . Weston .
My dear Emma , we must consider this .
