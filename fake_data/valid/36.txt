Harriet was too intent on the lines to hear .
The real evils , indeed , of Emma ' s situation were the power of having rather too much her own way , and a disposition to think a little too well of herself ; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments .
I dare say , Miss Fairfax , that he either gave his friend very minute directions , or wrote to Broadwood himself .
He had been most agreeable , most delightful ; he had told Harriet that he had seen them go by , and had purposely followed them ; other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt , but nothing serious .
Emma looked graciously .
While waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off , Emma found time , in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her voice and her taste , to look about , and see what became of Mr . Knightley .
" Between Mr . Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax ?
She then took another line of expediency , and looking into the doubtful room , observed ,
Nothing could be pleasanter .
I can imagine , that if you , as you are , Mr . Knightley , were to be transported and placed all at once in Mr . Frank Churchill ' s situation , you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him ; and it might have a very good effect .
A private dance , without sitting down to supper , was pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women ; and Mrs . Weston must not speak of it again .
And Jane will have such another .
" Poor girl !"
I have heard him speak with great animation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are intimate with , who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece ."
Such schemes as these are nothing without numbers .
aye , I know your scruples .
yes , I always like news .
She continued to look back , but in vain ; and soon , with what appeared unusual speed , they were half way down the hill , and every thing left far behind .
Here is my sketch of the fourth , who was a baby .
She was in gay spirits , and would have prolonged the conversation , wanting to hear the particulars of his suspicions , every look described , and all the wheres and hows of a circumstance which highly entertained her : but his gaiety did not meet hers .
" This will not be your only visit to Randalls ."
Well , I was persuaded there were two .
The name makes me think of poor Isabella ; for she was very near being christened Catherine after her grandmama .
I must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me , as to that .
the proper sport of boys and girls , but a single woman , of good fortune , is always respectable , and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else .
" I must not hope to be ever situated as you are , in the midst of every dearest connexion , and therefore I cannot expect that simply growing older should make me indifferent about letters ."
He came down by yesterday ' s coach , and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast , to report his proceedings , first on my affairs , and then on his own .
She looked up at him for a moment , coloured deeply , and played something else .
" Yes , I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him ."
I know what your drawings are .
He was a married man , with only one living child , a girl , about Jane ' s age : and Jane became their guest , paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all ; and before she was nine years old , his daughter ' s great fondness for her , and his own wish of being a real friend , united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her education .
A degree or two lower , and a creditable appearance might interest me ; I might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other .
There will be but one subject throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury ; but one interest -- one object of curiosity ; it will be all Mr . Frank Churchill ; we shall think and speak of nobody else ."
" I do not know what I could imagine , but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers .
Poor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that Emma could give .
Such as Mrs . Elton appeared to her on this second interview , such she appeared whenever they met again ,-- self - important , presuming , familiar , ignorant , and ill - bred .
She pondered , but could think of nothing .
How the delicacy , the discretion of his favourite could have been so lain asleep !
Could not have imagined it .-- So well lighted up !-- Jane , Jane , look !-- did you ever see any thing ?
Miss Woodhouse , the comfort of being sometimes alone !"
He thought principally of Mrs . Churchill ' s illness , and wanted to know how she was treated ; and as for the ball , it was shocking to have dear Emma disappointed ; but they would all be safer at home .
Only think of those sweet verses --` To Miss --------.'
The charming Augusta Hawkins , in addition to all the usual advantages of perfect beauty and merit , was in possession of an independent fortune , of so many thousands as would always be called ten ; a point of some dignity , as well as some convenience : the story told well ; he had not thrown himself away -- he had gained a woman of 10 , 000 l . or thereabouts ; and he had gained her with such delightful rapidity -- the first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by distinguishing notice ; the history which he had to give Mrs . Cole of the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious -- the steps so quick , from the accidental rencontre , to the dinner at Mr . Green ' s , and the party at Mrs . Brown ' s -- smiles and blushes rising in importance -- with consciousness and agitation richly scattered -- the lady had been so easily impressed -- so sweetly disposed -- had in short , to use a most intelligible phrase , been so very ready to have him , that vanity and prudence were equally contented .
I thought you had lost half your property , at least .
Her attention was now claimed by Mr . Woodhouse , who being , according to his custom on such occasions , making the circle of his guests , and paying his particular compliments to the ladies , was ending with her -- and with all his mildest urbanity , said ,
We talked it all over with Mr . Weston last night .
You have cured her of her school - girl ' s giggle ; she really does you credit ."
He could not be persuaded that so many good - looking houses as he saw around him , could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting ; and even when particulars were given and families described , he was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing , or that there would be the smallest difficulty in every body ' s returning into their proper place the next morning .
Oh !
" Dear Emma bears every thing so well ," said her father .
You think so , do not you ?"
He went to town on business three days ago , and I got him to take charge of some papers which I was wanting to send to John .-- He delivered these papers to John , at his chambers , and was asked by him to join their party the same evening to Astley ' s .
If one could ascertain what the chief of them -- the Coles , for instance .
With insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every body ' s feelings ; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every body ' s destiny .
Consider from how partial a quarter your information came .
Emma was very willing now to acquit her of having seduced Mr . Dixon ' s actions from his wife , or of any thing mischievous which her imagination had suggested at first .
Here ceased the concert part of the evening , for Miss Woodhouse and Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers ; but soon ( within five minutes ) the proposal of dancing -- originating nobody exactly knew where -- was so effectually promoted by Mr . and Mrs . Cole , that every thing was rapidly clearing away , to give proper space .
She talked with a great deal of reason , and at least equal affection -- but she had too much to urge for Emma ' s attention ; it was soon gone to Brunswick Square or to Donwell ; she forgot to attempt to listen ; and when Mrs . Weston ended with , " We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for , you know , but I hope it will soon come ," she was obliged to pause before she answered , and at last obliged to answer at random , before she could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for .
It was felt as such things must be felt .
dear , Kingston -- are you ?-- Mrs .
This had happened the year before .
Emma ' s project of forgetting Mr . Elton for a while made her rather sorry to find , when they had all taken their places , that he was close to her .
This was the conclusion of the first series of reflection .
She was stopped by a slight fit of coughing , and Mr . Weston instantly seized the opportunity of going on .
I have heard him express himself so warmly on those points !-- Such an admirer of her performance on the pianoforte , and of her voice !
Emma thanked him , but could not allow of his disappointing his friend on their account ; her father was sure of his rubber .
CHAPTER I
If you think he will come , I shall think so too ; for you know Enscombe ."
you clever creature , that ' s very true .
I do not by any means engage for its being returned .
Emma listened with the warmest concern ; grieved for her more and more , and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful .
The horror of being blocked up at Randalls , while her children were at Hartfield , was full in her imagination ; and fancying the road to be now just passable for adventurous people , but in a state that admitted no delay , she was eager to have it settled , that her father and Emma should remain at Randalls , while she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them .
Whatever money he might come into when his father died , whatever his share of the family property , it is , I dare say , all afloat , all employed in his stock , and so forth ; and though , with diligence and good luck , he may be rich in time , it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet ."
said Mr . Woodhouse , always the last to make his way in conversation ; " then give me leave to assure you that you will find her a very agreeable young lady .
regular features , open countenance , with a complexion !
Had you not been surrounded by other friends , I might have been tempted to introduce a subject , to ask questions , to speak more openly than might have been strictly correct .-- I feel that I should certainly have been impertinent ."
" But will there be good room for five couple ?-- I really do not think there will ."
I went in for three minutes , and was detained by Miss Bates ' s being absent .
She was ready to tell every thing in her power , but on this subject questions were vain .
Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell .
I give you notice that as I find your son , so I shall judge of him .-- I am no flatterer ."
My dear sir , you are too obliging .
" Those who knew any thing about it , must have felt the difference .
Have you heard from Mrs . John Knightley lately ?
The advantages of Bath to the young are pretty generally understood .
" For shame , Emma !
He was not an ill - tempered man , not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a reproach ; but his temper was not his great perfection ; and , indeed , with such a worshipping wife , it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not be increased .
" Miss Smith !-- oh !-- I had not observed .-- You are extremely obliging -- and if I were not an old married man .-- But my dancing days are over , Mrs . Weston .
" Mrs . Dixon !
" Certainly , if you wish it ;-- but you are not going to walk to Highbury alone ?"
" Oh no !
Of all houses in the kingdom Mrs . Bragge ' s is the one I would most wish to see you in ."
To talk would be only to irritate .-- She wrote to her , therefore , kindly , but decisively , to beg that she would not , at present , come to Hartfield ; acknowledging it to be her conviction , that all farther confidential discussion of _one_ topic had better be avoided ; and hoping , that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again , except in the company of others -- she objected only to a tete - a - tete -- they might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday .-- Harriet submitted , and approved , and was grateful .
As a magistrate , he had generally some point of law to consult John about , or , at least , some curious anecdote to give ; and as a farmer , as keeping in hand the home - farm at Donwell , he had to tell what every field was to bear next year , and to give all such local information as could not fail of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his life , and whose attachments were strong .
My dear Miss Woodhouse -- I come quite over - powered .
She looked on with some amusement .-- Miss Bates ' s gratitude for Mrs . Elton ' s attentions to Jane was in the first style of guileless simplicity and warmth .
No indeed !-- There was not a hint of Mr . Martin .
.
Mr . Weston might be his son ' s superior .-- In spite of this little rub , however , Emma was smiling with enjoyment , delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming , and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her .-- She was more disturbed by Mr . Knightley ' s not dancing than by any thing else .-- There he was , among the standers - by , where he ought not to be ; he ought to be dancing ,-- not classing himself with the husbands , and fathers , and whist - players , who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were made up ,-- so young as he looked !-- He could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere , than where he had placed himself .
" To be sure , so it is .
