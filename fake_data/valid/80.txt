Mrs . Elton was very much disappointed .
Now , here will be Mr . Elton and Miss Hawkins ; and there are the Coles , such very good people ; and the Perrys -- I suppose there never was a happier or a better couple than Mr . and Mrs . Perry .
This happened the night before last .
Early , I know , you had none ."
There go you and your riddle - book one of these days ."
She could then see more and judge better .
" Ought to refuse him !
The room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied , and looking forwards ; behind it was another with which it immediately communicated ; the door between them was open , and Emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner .
" It seems like madness !
and to see you in such excellent looks !-- I would not have missed this meeting for the world .
Miss Smith , pray take care .
" That may be -- but not by sketches in Swisserland .
" Thank you , thank you .-- This is just what I wanted to be assured of .-- Oh !
He looked at her , as if wanting to read her thoughts .
Now , as we may fairly suppose , he would not allow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady , and as he does not appear to have spoken yesterday , it is not unlikely that he should be at Mrs . Goddard ' s to - day ; and she may be detained by a visitor , without thinking him at all a tiresome wretch ."
" Yes , very soon .
It was no longer in Emma ' s power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures .
When Harriet had closed her evidence , she appealed to her dear Miss Woodhouse , to say whether she had not good ground for hope .
" Oh !
" That sweet , amiable Jane Fairfax !"
cried Mr . John Knightley , hearing his own name .
I bring a new proposal on the subject :-- a thought of my father ' s , which waits only your approbation to be acted upon .
If Frank Churchill had wanted to see his father , he would have contrived it between September and January .
are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr .
I was so astonished when she first told me what she had been saying to Mrs . Elton , and when Mrs . Elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it !
And Emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment repeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it .
A charming place , undoubtedly .
" Oh , the difference of situation and habit !
Till now that she was threatened with its loss , Emma had never known how much of her happiness depended on being _first_ with Mr . Knightley , first in interest and affection .-- Satisfied that it was so , and feeling it her due , she had enjoyed it without reflection ; and only in the dread of being supplanted , found how inexpressibly important it had been .-- Long , very long , she felt she had been first ; for , having no female connexions of his own , there had been only Isabella whose claims could be compared with hers , and she had always known exactly how far he loved and esteemed Isabella .
" I should not have thought it possible ," she began , " that you could have misunderstood me !
We are growing a little too nice .
Is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers ; and has not Mrs . Weston some inimitable figure - pieces in her drawing - room , at Randalls ?"
She had sent while dressing , and the answer had been , " Much the same -- not better ."
Emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost ; and all that was amiable , all that ought to be attaching , seemed on Harriet ' s side , not her own .
I shall not be far off , if you want me ."
After some attempts , therefore , to be permitted to begin again , they were obliged to thank Mrs . Weston , look sorrowful , and have done .
" Emma ," said Mr . Knightley presently , " I have a piece of news for you .
She had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself .
Mrs . Elton had received notice of it that morning , and was in raptures .
Yes , quite a proposal of marriage ; and a very good letter , at least she thought so .
She looked on with some amusement .-- Miss Bates ' s gratitude for Mrs . Elton ' s attentions to Jane was in the first style of guileless simplicity and warmth .
If ever there were people who , without having great wealth themselves , had every thing they could wish for , I am sure it is us .
" I am afraid Jane is not very well ," said she , " but I do not know ; they _tell_ me she is well .
He perfectly knew his own meaning ; and having warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious , and slightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend ,-- but acknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned at all ,-- he resumed the subject of his own passion , and was very urgent for a favourable answer .
It was a great consolation that Mr . Elton should not be really in love with her , or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint him -- that Harriet ' s nature should not be of that superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive -- and that there could be no necessity for any body ' s knowing what had passed except the three principals , and especially for her father ' s being given a moment ' s uneasiness about it .
said Jane , shaking her head ; " dear Mrs . Elton , who can have thought of it as I have done ?"
As she thought less of his inebriety , she thought more of his inconstancy and presumption ; and with fewer struggles for politeness , replied ,
Perhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her inferior in talent , and all the elegancies of mind .
here ' s Miss Woodhouse .-- Dear Miss Woodhouse , how do you do ?-- Very well I thank you , quite well .
There is great fear , great caution , great resolution somewhere .-- She is _not_ to be with the _Dixons_ .
They are not far off .
" Indeed you did .
Emma was silenced .
Yes , I understand the sort of mind .
if you knew how much I love every thing that is decided and open !-- Good - bye , good - bye ."
He was the son of Mr . Weston -- he was continually here -- I always found him very pleasant -- and , in short , for ( with a sigh ) let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously , they all centre in this at last -- my vanity was flattered , and I allowed his attentions .
She would not marry , even if she were asked by Mr . Knightley .
It is a great deal more natural than one could wish , that a young man , brought up by those who are proud , luxurious , and selfish , should be proud , luxurious , and selfish too .
" I hope ," said he presently , " I have not been severe upon poor Mrs . Churchill .
I could not excuse a man ' s having more music than love -- more ear than eye -- a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings .
Harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion , with great self - command .
In one respect Mrs . Elton grew even worse than she had appeared at first .
" Oh !
We will not be parted .
Will you chuse a wife for me ?-- I am sure I should like any body fixed on by you .
I am always glad to see him .
Of pride , indeed , there was , perhaps , scarcely enough ; his indifference to a confusion of rank , bordered too much on inelegance of mind .
" Well ," said Emma , willing to let it pass --" you want to hear about the wedding ; and I shall be happy to tell you , for we all behaved charmingly .
" How often , when you were a girl , have you said to me , with one of your saucy looks --` Mr . Knightley , I am going to do so - and - so ; papa says I may , or I have Miss Taylor ' s leave '-- something which , you knew , I did not approve .
" No ," cried Mr . Knightley , " that need not be the consequence .
The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square is very different from almost all the rest .
The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr . Knightley and Robert Martin was , at this moment , so strong to Emma ' s feelings , and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on Harriet ' s side , so fresh the sound of those words , spoken with such emphasis , " No , I hope I know better than to think of Robert Martin ," that she was really expecting the intelligence to prove , in some measure , premature .
" They aimed at wounding more than Harriet ," said he .
He had been going to call on them .
Have you heard the news ?
It made her animated -- open hearted -- she voluntarily said ;--
" He came to their father upon some business , and he asked him to stay to dinner ."
Do not you see that , at this instant , the very passage of her own letter , which sent me the report , is passing under her eye -- that the whole blunder is spread before her -- that she can attend to nothing else , though pretending to listen to the others ?"
The very want of such equality might prevent his perception of it ; but he must know that in fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior .
Now , however , it was absolutely to be ; every preparation was resumed , and very soon after the Churchills had removed to Richmond , a few lines from Frank , to say that his aunt felt already much better for the change , and that he had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty - four hours at any given time , induced them to name as early a day as possible .
" Oh !
" What felicity it is to hear a tune again which _has_ made one happy !-- If I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth ."
They are very , very kind in their visits .
" This would soon have led to something better , of course ," was her consoling reflection ; " any thing interests between those who love ; and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart .
My liveliness and your solidity would produce perfection .-- Not that I presume to insinuate , however , that _some_ people may not think _you_ perfection already .-- But hush !-- not a word , if you please ."
This is a matter of mere common politeness and good - breeding , and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry ."
William did not seem to mind it himself , he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many ; for William , you know , thinks more of his master ' s profit than any thing ; but Mrs . Hodges , he said , was quite displeased at their being all sent away .
She had not been able to speak ; and , on entering the carriage , sunk back for a moment overcome -- then reproaching herself for having taken no leave , making no acknowledgment , parting in apparent sullenness , she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference ; but it was just too late .
Mrs . Weston was disappointed .
It is Frank Churchill ' s duty to pay this attention to his father .
" A sore - throat !-- I hope not infectious .
Her ignorance is hourly flattery .
Every body must have seen the snow coming on .
But poor Mrs . Bates had a bad cold about a month ago ."
There is an openness , a quickness , almost a bluntness in Mr . Weston , which every body likes in _him_ , because there is so much good - humour with it -- but that would not do to be copied .
" Difference !
But she had believed them to be well - meaning , worthy people before ; and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion ?
It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his schemes ; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth , it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase Randalls , and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to ; but he had gone steadily on , with these objects in view , till they were accomplished .
She loves piquet , you know ; but when she is gone home , I am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself , instead of going to bed at your usual time -- and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort .
Emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable ; the conviction was strengthened by what followed .
