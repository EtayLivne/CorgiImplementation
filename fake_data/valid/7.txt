He came to the part of the room where the sitters - by were collected , spoke to some , and walked about in front of them , as if to shew his liberty , and his resolution of maintaining it .
Jane had come to Highbury professedly for three months ; the Campbells were gone to Ireland for three months ; but now the Campbells had promised their daughter to stay at least till Midsummer , and fresh invitations had arrived for her to join them there .
If Jane does not get well soon , we will call in Mr . Perry .
You saw her with the Campbells , when she was the equal of every body she mixed with , but here she is with a poor old grandmother , who has barely enough to live on .
" For my companion tells me ," said she , " that I absolutely promised Miss Bates last night , that I would come this morning .
" Emma , why is it that they are your enemies ?"
If I had not promoted Mr . Weston ' s visits here , and given many little encouragements , and smoothed many little matters , it might not have come to any thing after all .
" If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill , I have heard that already ."
" Oh , what a sweet house !-- How very beautiful !-- There are the yellow curtains that Miss Nash admires so much ."
The course of true love never did run smooth --
" Charming Miss Woodhouse !
Frank Churchill comes as regularly into my mind !"
She heard him sigh .
" I do not know why you should say so .
that ' s a great pity ; for I assure you , Miss Woodhouse , where the waters do agree , it is quite wonderful the relief they give .
As Harriet described it , there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour .
Mrs . Perry was always particularly fond of my mother -- indeed I do not know who is not -- and she had mentioned it to her in confidence ; she had no objection to her telling us , of course , but it was not to go beyond : and , from that day to this , I never mentioned it to a soul that I know of .
And , in short , from knowing his usual ways , I am very much inclined to think that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all .
A conundrum of Mr . Weston ' s shall clear him and his next neighbour .
" Yes ," he replied , and without the smallest apparent embarrassment .-- " But they would have done better had they given her notice of it .
Quite delightful to have you all meet so !-- Our little room so honoured !"
She is not to pay for the offence of others , by being held below the level of those with whom she is brought up .-- There can scarcely be a doubt that her father is a gentleman -- and a gentleman of fortune .-- Her allowance is very liberal ; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfort .-- That she is a gentleman ' s daughter , is indubitable to me ; that she associates with gentlemen ' s daughters , no one , I apprehend , will deny .-- She is superior to Mr . Robert Martin ."
Do you think him so very plain ?"
Emma did not repent her condescension in going to the Coles .
Emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost ; and all that was amiable , all that ought to be attaching , seemed on Harriet ' s side , not her own .
I really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else ."
I do congratulate you , Mrs . Weston , most warmly .
" My Emma , he means no such thing .
If you wish me to talk to Mrs . Hodges , or to inspect anything --"
She might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison , while a sharer of his conversation with her friend ; and from the best , the purest of motives , might now be denying herself this visit to Ireland , and resolving to divide herself effectually from him and his connexions by soon beginning her career of laborious duty .
VOLUME I
Had you witnessed my behaviour there , I can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well of me again .
After tea , Mr . and Mrs . Weston , and Mr . Elton sat down with Mr . Woodhouse to cards .
I rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness than I deserve .
We are very proud of the children , are not we , papa ?
This gallant young man , who seemed to love without feeling , and to recommend himself without complaisance , directly handed over the word to Miss Fairfax , and with a particular degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it .
Mr . Weston meanwhile , perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he was exciting , happy and cheerful as usual , and with all the right of being principal talker , which a day spent anywhere from home confers , was making himself agreeable among the rest ; and having satisfied the inquiries of his wife as to his dinner , convincing her that none of all her careful directions to the servants had been forgotten , and spread abroad what public news he had heard , was proceeding to a family communication , which , though principally addressed to Mrs . Weston , he had not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in the room .
" Both sir !
I am losing all my bitterness against spoilt children , my dearest Emma .
This wretched note was the finale of Emma ' s breakfast .
Her mind was quite sick of Mr . Elton and the Martins .
It is such enjoyment to them , that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of their taking turns , whichever began would never give way to the other ."
I protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one else .
I shall press you no more ."
At last , with some hesitation , Harriet said --
Emma , finding her so determined upon neglecting her music , had nothing more to say ; and , after a moment ' s pause , Mrs . Elton chose another subject .
It was a concern which brought just employment enough .
" I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature , in suspecting that he may have learnt to be above his connexions , and to care very little for any thing but his own pleasure , from living with those who have always set him the example of it .
Exactly so .
" Ah !
It was not so very bad .
Whenever James goes over to see his daughter , you know , she will be hearing of us .
He saw a short word prepared for Emma , and given to her with a look sly and demure .
for myself , I protest I must be excused ," said Mrs . Elton ; " _I_ really cannot attempt -- I am not at all fond of the sort of thing .
It will be the only difference ."
All this ran so glibly through her thoughts , that by the time her father had arranged himself , after the bustle of the Eltons ' departure , and was ready to speak , she was very tolerably capable of attending .
In that case , nothing could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she had resolved on .
He listened with all due deference ; acknowledged that he had heard many people say the same -- but yet he must confess , that to him nothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health .
" Well ," said Emma , " there is no disputing about taste .-- At least you admire her except her complexion ."
I cannot be so sanguine as Mr . Weston .
There must be ample room in it for every real comfort .
-- If he would say so to her at once , in the tone of decision becoming a man , there would be no opposition made to his going ."
Tell your aunt , little Emma , that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old grievances , and that if she were not wrong before , she is now ."
Her disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do ; and at eighteen or nineteen she was , as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children , fully competent to the office of instruction herself ; but she was too much beloved to be parted with .
It was owing to _her_ persuasion , as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm .
He had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to Highbury , as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal ; and the greater part of her new acquaintance , disposed to commend , or not in the habit of judging , following the lead of Miss Bates ' s good - will , or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she professed herself , were very well satisfied ; so that Mrs . Elton ' s praise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do , unimpeded by Miss Woodhouse , who readily continued her first contribution and talked with a good grace of her being " very pleasant and very elegantly dressed ."
Before this time last year I assure you we had had a delightful exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston ."
" He was four - and - twenty the 8th of last June , and my birthday is the 23rd just a fortnight and a day ' s difference -- which is very odd ."
I give you notice -- You will find me a formidable antagonist on that point .
" It must be a severe trial to them all .
With a little reserve of manner , Emma continued :
Gilbert ."
` The consequence ,' said she , ` has been a state of perpetual suffering to me ; and so it ought .
" That is what you have in your head , I know -- and what you would certainly say if my father were not by ."
He agreed to it , but with so quiet a " Yes ," as inclined her almost to doubt his real concurrence ; and yet there must be a very distinct sort of elegance for the fashionable world , if Jane Fairfax could be thought only ordinarily gifted with it .
There she was welcomed , with the utmost delight , by her father , who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage Lane -- turning a corner which he could never bear to think of -- and in strange hands -- a mere common coachman -- no James ; and there it seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well : for Mr . John Knightley , ashamed of his ill - humour , was now all kindness and attention ; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her father , as to seem -- if not quite ready to join him in a basin of gruel -- perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome ; and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party , except herself .-- But her mind had never been in such perturbation ; and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection .
But , unfortunately -- in short , if your compassion does not stand my friend --"
I am a talker , you know ; I am rather a talker ; and now and then I have let a thing escape me which I should not .
" Oh !
She now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark .
" I hope he does ," replied Mr . Knightley coolly , and resuming the letter .
And no apology left , no message for me .
Mrs . Weston had been delighted before , and was delighted again ; Emma joined her in all her praise ; and the pianoforte , with every proper discrimination , was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise .
She introduced him to her friend , Miss Smith , and , at convenient moments afterwards , heard what each thought of the other .
My mother ' s are really very good indeed .
When we talked about him , it was as clear as possible ."
But you had better go with Mrs . Weston and hear the instrument ."
He had expressed himself as to coming , with more than common certainty .
Every thing so good !"
You see how delightfully she writes .
Woodhouse ?-- I am so glad to hear such a good account .
" How do you do , Mrs . Ford ?
I never had much opinion of the sea air ."
In Frank ' s last letter she complained , he said , of being too weak to get into her conservatory without having both his arm and his uncle ' s !
How improperly had she been acting by Harriet !
My dear Mrs . Weston , do not take to match - making .
my dear ; but so much as Patty has to do !-- And it is a kindness to employ our men ."
I see no advantage in consulting Miss Bates ."
You divert me against my conscience .
She thought it was time to make up .
