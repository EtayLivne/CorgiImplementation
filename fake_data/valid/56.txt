It was quite a chance , he said , that he had not gone round by Randalls .
CHAPTER IV
" To be sure I am .
What arises from discretion must be honoured ."
" I am disappointed ," was his only answer .
VOLUME I
" One can suppose nothing else ," added Mrs . Cole , " and I was only surprized that there could ever have been a doubt .
` My friend Knightley ' had been so often mentioned , that I was really impatient to see him ; and I must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he need not be ashamed of his friend .
" I was going to observe , sir ," said Frank Churchill , " that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any body ' s catching cold -- so much less danger at the Crown than at Randalls !
He has imposed on me , but he has not injured me .
" It is one that I shall never change , however ."
If meant to be immediately mixed with the others , and buried from sight , she should have looked on the table instead of looking just across , for it was not mixed ; and Harriet , eager after every fresh word , and finding out none , directly took it up , and fell to work .
His wish of staying longer evidently did not please ; but it was not opposed .
that I had never seen her !"
said Emma , laughing .
" Oh yes ; next week ."
" I do not pretend to fix on times or places , but I must tell you that I have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of something to her advantage ."
" Come ," said he , " you are anxious for a compliment , so I will tell you that you have improved her .
Invite them both ."
shark is only one syllable .
Emma was in no danger of forgetting .
The two other gentlemen waited at the door to let her pass .
A degree or two lower , and a creditable appearance might interest me ; I might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other .
Her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses ; and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess , who had fallen little short of a mother in affection .
Oh !
" This is very true ," said she , " at least as far as relates to me , which was all that was meant -- and it is very shameful .-- Of the same age -- and always knowing her -- I ought to have been more her friend .-- She will never like me now .
" Oh !
I can hardly imagine the young man whom I saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well , if left quite to his own powers , and yet it is not the style of a woman ; no , certainly , it is too strong and concise ; not diffuse enough for a woman .
yes , I must be there ; I could not refuse ; and I will keep as much awake as I can ; but I would rather be at home , looking over William Larkins ' s week ' s account ; much rather , I confess .-- Pleasure in seeing dancing !-- not I , indeed -- I never look at it -- I do not know who does .-- Fine dancing , I believe , like virtue , must be its own reward .
Nay , he appeared so much otherwise , that his daughter ' s courage failed .
" I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome ."
I was very much pleased with all that he said .
Mrs . Weston had been speaking to her at the same moment .
Oh !
" Frank was here in February for a fortnight ."
She was sure of Mrs . Weston ' s wishing it to be communicated ; especially to one , who , like Mr . Knightley , had seen so much to blame in his conduct .
Their first pause was at the Crown Inn , an inconsiderable house , though the principal one of the sort , where a couple of pair of post - horses were kept , more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any run on the road ; and his companions had not expected to be detained by any interest excited there ; but in passing it they gave the history of the large room visibly added ; it had been built many years ago for a ball - room , and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly populous , dancing state , had been occasionally used as such ;-- but such brilliant days had long passed away , and now the highest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established among the gentlemen and half - gentlemen of the place .
no , I could not endure William Coxe -- a pert young lawyer ."
It was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits .
" I think her all you describe .
Emma was not required , by any subsequent discovery , to retract her ill opinion of Mrs . Elton .
" Worse than I had supposed .
my dear ; but so much as Patty has to do !-- And it is a kindness to employ our men ."
" Our little friend Harriet Smith , however , is just such another pretty kind of young person .
" There is one subject ," he replied , " I hope but one , on which we do not think alike ."
.
Mrs . Weston , your argument weighs most with me .
Harriet was remembered only from being _her_ friend .
However , she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago ; which is saying a great deal at my mother ' s time of life -- and it really is full two years , you know , since she was here .
I thought it very well done of him indeed .
-- But Mrs . Elton was very much discomposed indeed .--" Poor Knightley !
The service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart ."
" Three o ' clock yesterday !
Mrs . Elton left them no choice .
Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young , handsome , rich , nor married .
Absolute neglect of the mother and sisters , when invited to come , would be ingratitude .
Mr . Elton , in very good spirits , was one of the first to walk in .
I do not pretend to it .
He has encouragement enough to proceed , without our sighing out our souls over this charade ."
Mr . Knightley ' s excessive curiosity to know what this word might be , made him seize every possible moment for darting his eye towards it , and it was not long before he saw it to be _Dixon_ .
Observe the turn of her throat .
I am sure I must have been as white as my gown .
Now , it so happened that in spite of Emma ' s resolution of never marrying , there was something in the name , in the idea of Mr . Frank Churchill , which always interested her .
There was no reason to suppose Mr . Elton thought at all differently from his wife .
He was not an ill - tempered man , not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a reproach ; but his temper was not his great perfection ; and , indeed , with such a worshipping wife , it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not be increased .
She was sitting by Mr . Knightley , and turned to him for help .
Mrs . Weston said no more ; and Emma could imagine with what surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat .
We really are so shocked !
poor Harriet !"
They would be married , and settled either at or near Enscombe .
Emma smiled , and felt that Mr . Weston had very good reason for saying so .
It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his schemes ; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth , it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase Randalls , and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to ; but he had gone steadily on , with these objects in view , till they were accomplished .
Like him , she had tried the scheme and rejected it ; but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her .
Mr . Wingfield told me that he has never known them more general or heavy -- except when it has been quite an influenza ."
All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject , but I believed none of it .
Now , Mr . Knightley , a word or two more , and I have done .
There are places in town , offices , where inquiry would soon produce something -- Offices for the sale -- not quite of human flesh -- but of human intellect ."
Her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted , and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy .
It may be possible to do without dancing entirely .
Never better .-- Don ' t I hear another carriage ?-- Who can this be ?-- very likely the worthy Coles .-- Upon my word , this is charming to be standing about among such friends !
-- which my mother , being on the watch , heard distinctly , and was sadly alarmed at .
" No , I thank you .
said she .
CHAPTER XVIII
Oh no !
Miss Fairfax , you must not run such risks .-- Liable as you have been to severe colds , indeed you ought to be particularly careful , especially at this time of year .
But ah !
" Me !
Might not the evening end in a dance ?
In half a minute they were in the room .
The aunt was as tiresome as ever ; more tiresome , because anxiety for her health was now added to admiration of her powers ; and they had to listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter she ate for breakfast , and how small a slice of mutton for dinner , as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her mother and herself ; and Jane ' s offences rose again .
Mrs . Weston had been speaking to her at the same moment .
Frank Churchill ' s character was not desperate .-- She was his own Emma , by hand and word , when they returned into the house ; and if he could have thought of Frank Churchill then , he might have deemed him a very good sort of fellow .
I must have given you up ."
Emma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance , and could now engage to think of them all at Randalls any hour of the day , with full confidence in their comfort .
I cannot see you acting wrong , without a remonstrance .
He was considering her as the source of all the happiness they offered .
There was one , however , which Emma thought something of .-- The two last dances before supper were begun , and Harriet had no partner ;-- the only young lady sitting down ;-- and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers , that how there could be any one disengaged was the wonder !-- But Emma ' s wonder lessened soon afterwards , on seeing Mr . Elton sauntering about .
Frank turned instantly to Emma , to claim her former promise ; and boasted himself an engaged man , which his father looked his most perfect approbation of -- and it then appeared that Mrs . Weston was wanting _him_ to dance with Mrs . Elton himself , and that their business was to help to persuade him into it , which was done pretty soon .-- Mr . Weston and Mrs . Elton led the way , Mr . Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed .
He had a great regard for Mrs . Goddard ; and Emma should write a line , and invite her .
