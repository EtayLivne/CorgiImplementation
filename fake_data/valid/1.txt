So seldom that a letter , among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom , is even carried wrong -- and not one in a million , I suppose , actually lost !
Mr . Weston would take no denial ; they must all dine at Randalls one day ;-- even Mr . Woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of the party .
They seem to satisfy every body else ."
Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business to be going forward just at this time ?-- Do you imagine it to be the consequence of an immediate commission from him , or that he may have sent only a general direction , an order indefinite as to time , to depend upon contingencies and conveniences ?"
They remained but a few minutes together , as Miss Woodhouse must not be kept waiting ; and Harriet then came running to her with a smiling face , and in a flutter of spirits , which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon to compose .
but he hoped he should in time ."
" No , sir ," cried Emma , " it confesses no such thing .
It is such a blessing !
She must abide by the evil of having refused him , whatever it may be ; and as to the refusal itself , I will not pretend to say that I might not influence her a little ; but I assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do .
If he were to be very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now , it might augur something .
" One would rather have a stranger preferred than one ' s very particular friend -- with a stranger it might not recur again -- but the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand , to do every thing better than one does oneself !-- Poor Mrs . Dixon !
I could have wished , however , as you know , that you had seen Mr . Wingfield before you left home ."
While he spoke , Emma ' s mind was most busy , and , with all the wonderful velocity of thought , had been able -- and yet without losing a word -- to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole ; to see that Harriet ' s hopes had been entirely groundless , a mistake , a delusion , as complete a delusion as any of her own -- that Harriet was nothing ; that she was every thing herself ; that what she had been saying relative to Harriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings ; and that her agitation , her doubts , her reluctance , her discouragement , had been all received as discouragement from herself .-- And not only was there time for these convictions , with all their glow of attendant happiness ; there was time also to rejoice that Harriet ' s secret had not escaped her , and to resolve that it need not , and should not .-- It was all the service she could now render her poor friend ; for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection from herself to Harriet , as infinitely the most worthy of the two -- or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever , without vouchsafing any motive , because he could not marry them both , Emma had it not .
Emma was almost too much astonished to answer ; but Mrs . Elton hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on .
A conundrum of Mr . Weston ' s shall clear him and his next neighbour .
To her he looked for comfort ; and her assurances of safety , her representation of the excellence of the horses , and of James , and of their having so many friends about them , revived him a little .
" Well ," said she , " and you soon silenced Mr . Cole , I suppose ?"
" Ever hear her !"
Emma restrained her indignation , and only turned from her in silence .
But colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn .
It was short , but expressed good sense , warm attachment , liberality , propriety , even delicacy of feeling .
Do not let mine continue longer .
These are the motives which I have been pressing on you .
So she thought at first ;-- but a little consideration convinced her that every thing need not be put off .
But hush , hush !"
A few minutes made Emma acquainted with the whole .
He knows he is wrong , and has nothing rational to urge .-- Bad .-- He ought not to have formed the engagement .--` His father ' s disposition :'-- he is unjust , however , to his father .
and yet , she could not help rather anticipating something decisive .
A Miss Hawkins of Bath .
After this speech he was gone as soon as possible .
I dare say she did not understand me ."
The result of this distress was , that , with a much more voluntary , cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the moment , she was able to fix her wedding - day -- and Mr . Elton was called on , within a month from the marriage of Mr . and Mrs . Robert Martin , to join the hands of Mr . Knightley and Miss Woodhouse .
Can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations ?
" Miss Fairfax ' s compliments and thanks , but is quite unequal to any exercise ."
Emma doubted the truth of this sentiment .
A word was put in for a second young Cox ; and at last , Mr . Weston naming one family of cousins who must be included , and another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out , it became a certainty that the five couple would be at least ten , and a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they could be disposed of .
I give you credit for it .
She is not a clever girl , but she has better sense than you are aware of , and does not deserve to have her understanding spoken of so slightingly .
They must both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and concealment ."
_Now_ I shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you ."
" Oh !
Find some body for me .
_Now_ you have nothing to try for .
" Does nothing occur to you ?-- Do not you recollect ?-- Harriet Smith ."
These feelings rapidly restored his comfort , while Mrs . Weston , of a more apprehensive disposition , foresaw nothing but a repetition of excuses and delays ; and after all her concern for what her husband was to suffer , suffered a great deal more herself .
For half an hour Mr . Weston was surprized and sorry ; but then he began to perceive that Frank ' s coming two or three months later would be a much better plan ; better time of year ; better weather ; and that he would be able , without any doubt , to stay considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner .
The speech was more to Emma than to Harriet , which Emma could understand .
Knightley .--" Robert Martin ' s manners have sense , sincerity , and good - humour to recommend them ; and his mind has more true gentility than Harriet Smith could understand ."
" A very serious sort , I assure you ;" still smiling .
After Emma had talked about it for ten minutes , Mr . Woodhouse felt no unwillingness , and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself , with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him .
It had a most favourable aspect ; and , for half a minute , Emma felt the glory of having schemed successfully .
It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin .
" Both sir !
While he talked to Isabella , however , Emma found an opportunity of saying ,
The sitting began ; and Harriet , smiling and blushing , and afraid of not keeping her attitude and countenance , presented a very sweet mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist .
" No , but it did not absolutely rain when I set out ."
Oh !
I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town .
-- seemed to burst from an overcharged heart , and to describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her , even towards some of those who loved her best .
Mr . Cole said how much taste you had ; and Mr . Frank Churchill talked a great deal about your taste , and that he valued taste much more than execution ."
A few minutes were sufficient for making her acquainted with her own heart .
While he talked to Isabella , however , Emma found an opportunity of saying ,
said she ; ` well , that is quite unexpected .
Mrs . Weston was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made himself -- how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether .
You will be perfectly safe , you know , among your friends ."
Mrs . Weston informed her that she was going to call on the Bateses , in order to hear the new instrument .
" Here ," resumed Harriet , turning to her box again , " here is something still more valuable , I mean that _has_ _been_ more valuable , because this is what did really once belong to him , which the court - plaister never did ."
" Yes , our good Mrs . Elton .
" To be sure .
The heat overcame me ."
It was almost enough to make her think of marrying .
And ( raising his voice still more ) I do not see why Miss Fairfax should not be mentioned too .
she was as grateful as possible , you may be sure .
But what did such particulars explain ?-- The fact was , as Emma could now acknowledge , that Harriet had always liked Robert Martin ; and that his continuing to love her had been irresistible .-- Beyond this , it must ever be unintelligible to Emma .
I was fatigued .
There is such perfect good - temper and good - will in Mr . Elton as one cannot but value ."
This moment , if you please .
Miss Taylor , if you had not married , you would have staid at home with me ."
My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings , Lords of the earth !
It was the end of an old pencil ,-- the part without any lead .
" Oh !
You make the best of it -- but after you have been a week at Hartfield , you are all of you different creatures ; you do not look like the same .
I was sitting near the door -- Elizabeth saw me directly ; but he did not ; he was busy with the umbrella .
If you prefer Mr . Martin to every other person ; if you think him the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with , why should you hesitate ?
" No ; not immediately here .
-- Those were Miss Woodhouse ' s words , were they ?-- And a fine ending -- and there is the letter .
There was a little blush , and then this answer ,
He has a wife and family to maintain , and is not to be giving away his time .
" You will not ask me what is the point of envy .-- You are determined , I see , to have no curiosity .-- You are wise -- but _I_ cannot be wise .
I did not know that I had fixed a day , but as he says I did , I am going now ."
Much better employed talking to the young ladies .
Part only of this answer , however , was admitted .
" It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy , but I cannot believe it .
Another view of man , my second brings , Behold him there , the monarch of the seas !
" You have , I believe , and know the whole ."
After an interval of some minutes , however , he began with ,
" And who do you think came in while we were there ?"
" Oh , what a sweet house !-- How very beautiful !-- There are the yellow curtains that Miss Nash admires so much ."
An unpretending , single - minded , artless girl -- infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a woman as Mrs . Elton .
Mr . Elton was the only one whose assistance she asked .
