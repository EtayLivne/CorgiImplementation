There is no use in delay .
She felt that half this folly must be drunkenness , and therefore could hope that it might belong only to the passing hour .
Referring the education to her seemed to imply it .
She was nobody when he married her , barely the daughter of a gentleman ; but ever since her being turned into a Churchill she has out - Churchill ' d them all in high and mighty claims : but in herself , I assure you , she is an upstart ."
His ideas seemed more moderate -- his feelings warmer .
" Yes , and what you told me on that head , confirmed an idea which I had entertained before .-- I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either Mr . Dixon or Miss Fairfax , but I cannot help suspecting either that , after making his proposals to her friend , he had the misfortune to fall in love with _her_ , or that he became conscious of a little attachment on her side .
It is my daily errand .
shark is only one syllable .
Emma was rather in dismay when only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things , and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment .
Mr . John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother .
and once Henry asked me for a knife , but I told him knives were only made for grandpapas .
and that ' s so dreadful !"
` If _Miss_ _Taylor_ undertakes to wrap Miss Emma up , you need not have any fears , sir .'
It was the very circumstance he could have wished for .
He always moved with the alertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory , but now he seemed more sudden than usual in his disappearance .
Campbell ."
Let no name ever pass our lips .
when a gallant young man , like Mr . Frank Churchill ," said Mr . Knightley dryly , " writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse , he will , of course , put forth his best ."
Harriet submitted , though her mind could hardly separate the parts , so as to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a declaration of love .
Very happy to hear it .
" But really , I am half ashamed , and wish I had never taken up the idea ."
He came back , had had his hair cut , and laughed at himself with a very good grace , but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he had done .
If he had been anxious for secrecy , he would not have left the paper while I was by ; but he rather pushed it towards me than towards you .
I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly what every man delights in -- what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his judgment .
She gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence ; but was really obliged to put an end to it , and request him to place himself elsewhere .
I fancy I am rather a favourite ; he took notice of my gown .
She thought so well of the letter , that when Mr . Knightley came again , she desired him to read it .
Better be without sense , than misapply it as you do ."
I am all amazement !
" That will do ," said he , when it was finished , thinking aloud -- " you have sung quite enough for one evening -- now be quiet ."
Her Bath habits made evening - parties perfectly natural to her , and Maple Grove had given her a taste for dinners .
" No ," cried Mr . Knightley , " that need not be the consequence .
Knightley must not marry !-- You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell ?-- Oh !
There will be enough of them , in all probability , to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need .
" Upon my honour ," said he very seriously , " it does not .
And I hate Italian singing .-- There is no understanding a word of it .
or a mermaid ?
CHAPTER V
He asked me if he could do any thing .
But I will shew her greater attention than I have done ."
" What felicity it is to hear a tune again which _has_ made one happy !-- If I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth ."
Emma was a good deal surprized ; but begged her to speak .
Emma ' s very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken the following day , by hearing that he was gone off to London , merely to have his hair cut .
" Yes ," said John Knightley , " and I think we shall have a good deal of it ."
We all know the difference between the pronouns he or she and thou , the plainest spoken amongst us ; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other -- a something more early implanted .
Ah !
To know that _she_ thought his coming certain was enough to make Emma consider it so , and sincerely did she rejoice in their joy .
replied the happily deceived aunt , while eagerly hunting for the letter .--" Oh !
" I am sure you were of use to me ," cried Emma .
And she is a good - natured woman after all .
Once , I felt the fire rather too much ; but then I moved back my chair a little , a very little , and it did not disturb me .
Emma made no answer , and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned , but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone .
And so then , in my nonsense , I could not help making a treasure of it -- so I put it by never to be used , and looked at it now and then as a great treat ."
and it was but yesterday I was telling Mr . Cole , I really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing - room , while I do not know one note from another , and our little girls , who are but just beginning , perhaps may never make any thing of it ; and there is poor Jane Fairfax , who is mistress of music , has not any thing of the nature of an instrument , not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world , to amuse herself with .-- I was saying this to Mr . Cole but yesterday , and he quite agreed with me ; only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase , hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can ; and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought -- or else I am sure we ought to be ashamed of it .-- We are in great hopes that Miss Woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening ."
They were called on to share in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses , and obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others ; but when the table was again safely covered , when every corner dish was placed exactly right , and occupation and ease were generally restored , Emma said ,
She said no more , other subjects took their turn ; and the rest of the dinner passed away ; the dessert succeeded , the children came in , and were talked to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation ; a few clever things said , a few downright silly , but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the other -- nothing worse than everyday remarks , dull repetitions , old news , and heavy jokes .
He agreed to it , but with so quiet a " Yes ," as inclined her almost to doubt his real concurrence ; and yet there must be a very distinct sort of elegance for the fashionable world , if Jane Fairfax could be thought only ordinarily gifted with it .
CHAPTER XVI
" She must be very lively , and have hazle eyes .
" I am afraid we must be running away ," said Emma , glancing at Harriet , and beginning to rise --" My father will be expecting us .
" _My_ report from Mrs . Goddard ' s ," said she presently , " was not so pleasant as I had hoped --` Not better ' was _my_ answer ."
" They would have solicited the honour earlier , but had been waiting the arrival of a folding - screen from London , which they hoped might keep Mr . Woodhouse from any draught of air , and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour of his company ."
" What a precious deposit !"
The answer was only in this short note :
The wish of distinguishing her , as far as civility permitted , was very evident , though it could not often proceed beyond a look .
My dear Harriet , what do you mean ?
She saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed her before .
He shook his head and laughed .--" I cannot separate Miss Fairfax and her complexion ."
" But you have not seen so much of the world as I have .
" But then , to be an old maid at last , like Miss Bates !"
They owed to him their two or three politest puzzles ; and the joy and exultation with which at last he recalled , and rather sentimentally recited , that well - known charade ,
He comes to Highbury himself , he says , six days out of the seven , and has always business at Ford ' s .
" Very soon , very soon , indeed ; that ' s the worst of it .
CHAPTER VIII
The invitation was everywhere so well received , that it seemed as if , like Mrs . Elton , they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to themselves .-- Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it ; and Mr . Weston , unasked , promised to get Frank over to join them , if possible ; a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with .-- Mr . Knightley was then obliged to say that he should be glad to see him ; and Mr . Weston engaged to lose no time in writing , and spare no arguments to induce him to come .
" Oh !"
A very gracious invitation was returned , and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion .
Emma felt that Mrs . Weston was giving her a momentary glance ; and she was herself struck by his warmth .
" Oh yes ; next week ."
" Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth .
" Oh !
" We consider our Hartfield pork ," replied Mr . Woodhouse --" indeed it certainly is , so very superior to all other pork , that Emma and I cannot have a greater pleasure than --"
But Emma still shook her head in steady scepticism .
But the compassionate feelings of a friend of her father gave a change to her destiny .
Heavens !
Fortunately , however , it did cease .
-- Harriet ' s was --
She cast her eye over it , pondered , caught the meaning , read it through again to be quite certain , and quite mistress of the lines , and then passing it to Harriet , sat happily smiling , and saying to herself , while Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope and dulness , " Very well , Mr . Elton , very well indeed .
at three - and - twenty to be the king of his company -- the great man -- the practised politician , who is to read every body ' s character , and make every body ' s talents conduce to the display of his own superiority ; to be dispensing his flatteries around , that he may make all appear like fools compared with himself !
I am going to London , to spend a few days with John and Isabella .
I should not be helped so soon , but it smells most excellent , and I cannot help beginning ."
I only name possibilities .
It was a private resolution of hers , not communicated to him -- or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction .-- Till yesterday , I know he said he was in the dark as to her plans .
She was particularly struck by his manner of considering Mr . Elton ' s house , which , as well as the church , he would go and look at , and would not join them in finding much fault with .
I met _one_ as I came -- Madness in such weather !-- absolute madness !"
Goddard ' s ."
She hardly wished to have more leisure for them .
.
-- He met her at the parlour - door , and hardly asking her how she did , in the natural key of his voice , sunk it immediately , to say , unheard by her father ,
Her influence would have been enough .
