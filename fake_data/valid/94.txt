Mrs . Weston was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made himself -- how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether .
This proves that he can leave the Churchills ."
Be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited .
" Well ," said she to herself , " this is most strange !-- After I had got him off so well , to chuse to go into company , and leave Harriet ill behind !-- Most strange indeed !-- But there is , I believe , in many men , especially single men , such an inclination -- such a passion for dining out -- a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures , their employments , their dignities , almost their duties , that any thing gives way to it -- and this must be the case with Mr . Elton ; a most valuable , amiable , pleasing young man undoubtedly , and very much in love with Harriet ; but still , he cannot refuse an invitation , he must dine out wherever he is asked .
Her heart beat quick on hearing Harriet ' s footstep and voice ; so , she supposed , had poor Mrs . Weston felt when _she_ was approaching Randalls .
There was no denying that those brothers had penetration .
But hardly had she so spoken , when she found her brother was civilly offering a seat in his carriage , if the weather were Mr . Elton ' s only objection , and Mr . Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction .
Well , I was persuaded there were two .
but I never have been in love ; it is not my way , or my nature ; and I do not think I ever shall .
I think your manners to him encouraging .
She would catch a dreadful cold .
I always deserve the best treatment , because I never put up with any other ; and , therefore , you must give me a plain , direct answer .
" He is very obliging ," said Emma ; " but is he sure that Harriet means to marry him ?"
She was , of course , the object of their joint dislike .-- When they had nothing else to say , it must be always easy to begin abusing Miss Woodhouse ; and the enmity which they dared not shew in open disrespect to her , found a broader vent in contemptuous treatment of Harriet .
here it is .
But never did she go without Mr . Woodhouse ' s giving a gentle sigh , and saying , " Ah , poor Miss Taylor !
" Emma ," said she , " this paper is worse than I expected .
he continued ; " every day more precious and more delightful than the day before !-- every day making me less fit to bear any other place .
For his own sake , I would not have him do so mad a thing ."
" Such an extraordinary dream of mine !"
The pain of his continued residence in Highbury , however , must certainly be lessened by his marriage .
She is still nearer .-- And I do not know whether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body .
Oh , said I , Patty do not come with your bad news to me .
Delighted to hear it indeed .
And the more sensibility you betray of their just horrors , the more I shall like you ."
He fancied bathing might be good for it -- the warm bath -- but she says it did him no lasting benefit .
" You had better go on ," said she .
and she and her partner the happiest !--" I said it would be so ," was the only consolation .
But Mr . Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits , not at all to confuse his intellects .
He certainly might have heard Mr . Elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done , and Mr . Elton might not be of an imprudent , inconsiderate disposition as to money matters ; he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them ; but then , Mr . Knightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives .
" What can it be , Miss Woodhouse ?-- what can it be ?
Mrs . Dixon has persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly .
said she .--" To chuse to remain here month after month , under privations of every sort !
I am quite enough in love .
Yes , that will be quite enough for pleasure .
I shall never forget his flying Henry ' s kite for him that very windy day last Easter -- and ever since his particular kindness last September twelvemonth in writing that note , at twelve o ' clock at night , on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham , I have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence .-- If any body can deserve him , it must be Miss Taylor ."
They were so deserving , that a _little_ higher should have been enough : but as it was , how could she have done otherwise ?-- Impossible !-- She could not repent .
" Ah !
It was folly to be disturbed by it .
No , she had heard from him very lately , but having answered the letter , had put it away .
My dear Emma , I am longing to talk to you .
The marriage of Lieut .
Contrary to the usual course of things , Mr . Elton ' s wanting to pay his addresses to her had sunk him in her opinion .
But sometimes of an evening , before we went to cards , he would read something aloud out of the Elegant Extracts , very entertaining .
And as for Harriet , I will venture to say that _she_ cannot gain by the acquaintance .
But what did such particulars explain ?-- The fact was , as Emma could now acknowledge , that Harriet had always liked Robert Martin ; and that his continuing to love her had been irresistible .-- Beyond this , it must ever be unintelligible to Emma .
I am exceedingly obliged to you , Mrs . Elton , I am obliged to any body who feels for me , but I am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer .
It was very wrong of me , you know , to keep any remembrances , after he was married .
Respect would be added to affection .
" No , not at Randalls ; I have not been near Randalls ," when the door was thrown open , and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room .
Go , and interfere .
I undertake the commission .
Or Miss Bates ?
Harriet was silent .
He quitted the militia and engaged in trade , having brothers already established in a good way in London , which afforded him a favourable opening .
The public pays and must be served well ."
Miss Fairfax must already have given her account .-- I shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow ."
Emma felt that Mrs . Weston was giving her a momentary glance ; and she was herself struck by his warmth .
CHAPTER XII
The very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten !-- My dear Mr . E ., he must have left a message for you , I am sure he must .-- Not even Knightley could be so very eccentric ;-- and his servants forgot it .
He certainly might have heard Mr . Elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever done , and Mr . Elton might not be of an imprudent , inconsiderate disposition as to money matters ; he might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them ; but then , Mr . Knightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives .
Not that she _wanted_ him to marry .
.
It is a most uncommon complexion , with her dark eye - lashes and hair -- a most distinguishing complexion !
" Mr . Knightley ' s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare Mr . Martin with _him_ .
" Oh !"
The first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to attend , was the name of Jane Fairfax .
It will be giving him so much pleasure !
` It is only Mrs . Cole ,' said I , ` depend upon it .
Emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which Mr . Weston depended , and felt , that to be the favourite and intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes , was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity .
Such a sad loss to our party to - day !"
This is the simple truth ."
It then occurred to her to employ him in reading .
It soon appeared that London was not the place for her .
I am sure of having their opinions with me ."
Happy creature !
Harriet Smith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly , exclusively , passionately loved by Mr . Knightley .
You will not like staying late .
" No trouble in the world , ma ' am ," said the obliging Mrs . Ford .
" You may well be amazed ," returned Mrs . Weston , still averting her eyes , and talking on with eagerness , that Emma might have time to recover -- " You may well be amazed .
" Harriet !"
_We_ must begin ; we must go and pay wedding visit very soon ."
" Aye , very true .
perfectly .
She had nothing to wish otherwise , but that the days did not pass so swiftly .
The rich brother - in - law near Bristol was the pride of the alliance , and his place and his carriages were the pride of him .
Emma could not suppose any such thing , knowing as she did , that both the Mr . Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself ;-- and two basins only were ordered .
Mr . Elton looked all happiness at this proposition ; and nothing could exceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage .
said he quietly , and looking at her ; " of what nature ?"
" Oh !
Mr . Woodhouse talked over his alarms , and Emma was in spirits to persuade them away with all her usual promptitude .
She was sitting by Mr . Knightley , and turned to him for help .
Very odd !
" I hope not _that_ .-- It is not likely .
" I know there is such an idea with many people , but indeed it is quite a mistake , sir .-- We all had our health perfectly well there , never found the least inconvenience from the mud ; and Mr . Wingfield says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy ; and I am sure he may be depended on , for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air , and his own brother and family have been there repeatedly ."
" Yes , oh !
He quitted the militia and engaged in trade , having brothers already established in a good way in London , which afforded him a favourable opening .
those dear little children .
Now I am secure of you for ever ."
" You seem determined to think ill of him ."
