" It is very unfair to judge of any body ' s conduct , without an intimate knowledge of their situation .
" Be satisfied ," said he , " I will not raise any outcry .
But I kept my eye on it ; and , as soon as I dared , caught it up , and never parted with it again from that moment ."
We have notice of it in a letter to - day .
Upon the whole , Emma left her with such softened , charitable feelings , as made her look around in walking home , and lament that Highbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her independence ; nobody that she could wish to scheme about for her .
the blessing of a female correspondent , when one is really interested in the absent !-- she will tell me every thing .
She was , in fact , beginning very much to wonder that she had ever thought him pleasing at all ; and his sight was so inseparably connected with some very disagreeable feelings , that , except in a moral light , as a penance , a lesson , a source of profitable humiliation to her own mind , she would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him again .
Mr . Knightley suspected in Frank Churchill the determination of catching her eye -- he seemed watching her intently -- in vain , however , if it were so -- Jane passed between them into the hall , and looked at neither .
You do not know what it is to have tempers to manage ."
I shall have no fears for you with him .
Do you mean with regard to this letter ?"
The Coles expressed themselves so properly -- there was so much real attention in the manner of it -- so much consideration for her father .
" We can finish this some other time , you know .
I bring a new proposal on the subject :-- a thought of my father ' s , which waits only your approbation to be acted upon .
Mr . Weston , always alert when business was to be done , and as incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable , as of foreseeing any that was doubtful , said , " It was time to go ;" and the young man , though he might and did sigh , could not but agree , to take leave .
You will excuse me .
The evening is closing in , and grandmama will be looking for us .
I will bring friends with me ."
So very odd we should happen to meet !
How do you do , Mr .
Harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager exclamation .
However , _I_ shall always think it a very pleasant party , and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it ."
" But really , I am half ashamed , and wish I had never taken up the idea ."
She had previously determined how far she would proceed , on any application of the sort ; and it would be safer for both , to have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed .-- She was decided , and thus spoke --
It was felt as such things must be felt .
Perhaps he wanted to speak to her , of his attachment to Harriet ; he might be watching for encouragement to begin .-- She did not , could not , feel equal to lead the way to any such subject .
Mr . Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it , besides all the history of his own and Isabella ' s coming , and of Emma ' s being to follow , and had indeed just got to the end of his satisfaction that James should come and see his daughter , when the others appeared , and Mrs . Weston , who had been almost wholly engrossed by her attentions to him , was able to turn away and welcome her dear Emma .
" I am glad you think I have been useful to her ; but Harriet only wanted drawing out , and receiving a few , very few hints .
Your views for Harriet are best known to yourself ; but as you make no secret of your love of match - making , it is fair to suppose that views , and plans , and projects you have ;-- and as a friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton is the man , I think it will be all labour in vain ."
Mr . Churchill , oh !
-- The pertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear .
There is always a look of consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be beneath them .
Better be without sense , than misapply it as you do ."
This is saying very plainly --` Pray , Miss Smith , give me leave to pay my addresses to you .
There is a littleness about him which you discovered , and which I did not : and I was fully convinced of his being in love with Harriet .
He had returned to a late dinner , and walked to Hartfield as soon as it was over .
I doubt whether he will return the compliment , and discover her to be a lady .
" How d ' ye do ?-- how d ' ye do ?-- Very well , I thank you .
the letter had much better be all your own .
" Is not she looking well ?"
cried Jane , with a blush and an hesitation which Emma thought infinitely more becoming to her than all the elegance of all her usual composure --" there would have been no danger .
leave all that to me .
" So do I ," said Mrs . Weston gently , " very much ."
He had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she wanted , and he could sometimes act an ungracious , or say a severe thing .
Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer , and advised its being written directly , which was agreed to , in the hope of her assistance ; and though Emma continued to protest against any assistance being wanted , it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence .
In the daily interchange of news , they must be again restricted to the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings ' coming had been united , such as the last accounts of Mrs . Churchill , whose health seemed every day to supply a different report , and the situation of Mrs . Weston , whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child , as that of all her neighbours was by the approach of it .
Perry does not call it altogether a sickly season ."
And as to conceit , he is the farthest from it of any man I know .
But hardly had she so spoken , when she found her brother was civilly offering a seat in his carriage , if the weather were Mr . Elton ' s only objection , and Mr . Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction .
I hope you have pleasant accounts from Windsor ?"
He seemed to be almost asking her , whether her affections were engaged .-- But as soon as she ( Miss Woodhouse ) appeared likely to join them , he changed the subject , and began talking about farming :-- The second , was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour before Emma came back from her visit , the very last morning of his being at Hartfield -- though , when he first came in , he had said that he could not stay five minutes -- and his having told her , during their conversation , that though he must go to London , it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all , which was much more ( as Emma felt ) than he had acknowledged to _her_ .
It was a done thing ; Mr . Elton was to go , and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment ; never had his smile been stronger , nor his eyes more exulting than when he next looked at her .
She is known only as parlour - boarder at a common school .
Every body is lazy !
" I am almost certain that the meeting at the Crown is not till to - morrow .-- Mr .
Miss Taylor , if you had not married , you would have staid at home with me ."
" Only one more , papa ; only for Mr . Elton .
Fortune I do not want ; employment I do not want ; consequence I do not want : I believe few married women are half as much mistress of their husband ' s house as I am of Hartfield ; and never , never could I expect to be so truly beloved and important ; so always first and always right in any man ' s eyes as I am in my father ' s ."
They were both so truly respectable in their happiness , so disinterested in every sensation ; thought so much of Jane ; so much of every body , and so little of themselves , that every kindly feeling was at work for them .
Call upon her , by all means ."
I do not know who would ever look at him in the company of the other .
" My dear , you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him to be plain , and that you yourself --"
In the few minutes ' conversation which she had yet had with him , while Harriet had been partially insensible , he had spoken of her terror , her naivete , her fervour as she seized and clung to his arm , with a sensibility amused and delighted ; and just at last , after Harriet ' s own account had been given , he had expressed his indignation at the abominable folly of Miss Bickerton in the warmest terms .
He thanked her , observing , " How lucky that we should arrive at the same moment !
But between _us_ , I am convinced there never can be any likeness , except in being unmarried ."
In that respect Mrs . Weston ' s loss had been important .
As long as Mr . Knightley remained with them , Emma ' s fever continued ; but when he was gone , she began to be a little tranquillised and subdued -- and in the course of the sleepless night , which was the tax for such an evening , she found one or two such very serious points to consider , as made her feel , that even her happiness must have some alloy .
Mr . Woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused .
I could not think about you so much without doating on you , faults and all ; and by dint of fancying so many errors , have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least ."
But in time they will .
Those soft blue eyes , and all those natural graces , should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its connexions .
Here Mr . Weston joined them , and on hearing what was proposed , gave it his decided approbation .
-- What does this mean ?
What right had he to endeavour to please , as he certainly did -- to distinguish any one young woman with persevering attention , as he certainly did -- while he really belonged to another ?-- How could he tell what mischief he might be doing ?-- How could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him ?-- very wrong , very wrong indeed ."
These were charming feelings -- but not lasting .
CHAPTER XIII
" Our poor ball must be quite given up ."
it shews what a sad invalid I am !
I hope you have pleasant accounts from Windsor ?"
He had time only to say ,
You could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I fell into .
Have you heard the news ?
You will not regard being tired .
A very proper compliment !-- and then follows the application , which I think , my dear Harriet , you cannot find much difficulty in comprehending .
I hope you turned directly ."
" My picture !-- But he has left my picture in Bond - street ."
" That ' s true ," she cried --" very true .
Emma listened , and looked , and soon perceived that Frank Churchill ' s state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of humour .
To know that _she_ thought his coming certain was enough to make Emma consider it so , and sincerely did she rejoice in their joy .
Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr . Woodhouse ' s family , less as a governess than a friend , very fond of both daughters , but particularly of Emma .
_She_ disapproved them , which ought to have been enough .-- My plea of concealing the truth she did not think sufficient .-- She was displeased ; I thought unreasonably so : I thought her , on a thousand occasions , unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious : I thought her even cold .
" Oh !"
And Jane declares -- Well !--( as soon as she was within the door ) Well !
" And while Mrs . Weston pays her visit , I may be allowed , I hope ," said Frank Churchill , " to join your party and wait for her at Hartfield -- if you are going home ."
And now I can see it in no other light than as an offering of love ."
You have hit upon the very thing to please me ."
The housekeeper declared she knew nothing of my being expected .-- Very extraordinary !-- And nobody knew at all which way he was gone .
" Between Mr . Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax ?
" No , no ,"-- he gravely replied .--" Don ' t ask me .
I smile because you smile , and shall probably suspect whatever I find you suspect ; but at present I do not see what there is to question .
