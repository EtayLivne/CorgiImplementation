It was much easier to chat than to study ; much pleasanter to let her imagination range and work at Harriet ' s fortune , than to be labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts ; and the only literary pursuit which engaged Harriet at present , the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life , was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with , into a thin quarto of hot - pressed paper , made up by her friend , and ornamented with ciphers and trophies .
It was a dislike so little just -- every imputed fault was so magnified by fancy , that she never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any considerable absence , without feeling that she had injured her ; and now , when the due visit was paid , on her arrival , after a two years ' interval , she was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners , which for those two whole years she had been depreciating .
WINDSOR - JULY .
Respect for right conduct is felt by every body .
That she was really ill was very certain ; he had declared himself convinced of it , at Randalls .
How is she to - day ?
she is a sweet creature !
" Oh !
I am sure there is nobody ' s praise that could give us so much pleasure as Miss Woodhouse ' s .
In half an hour the arrowroot was returned , with a thousand thanks from Miss Bates , but " dear Jane would not be satisfied without its being sent back ; it was a thing she could not take -- and , moreover , she insisted on her saying , that she was not at all in want of any thing ."
" We will not allow her to do such a thing again :"-- and nodding significantly --" there must be some arrangement made , there must indeed .
But what is distance , Mr . Weston , to people of large fortune ?-- You would be amazed to hear how my brother , Mr . Suckling , sometimes flies about .
Mr . and Mrs . Elton appeared ; and all the smiles and the proprieties passed .
It was but an effusion of lively spirits .
But Mr . Elton , in person , had driven away all such cares .
I believe it is the only way that Mr . Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome .
I am sorry for it .
He stopt again , rose again , and seemed quite embarrassed .-- He was more in love with her than Emma had supposed ; and who can say how it might have ended , if his father had not made his appearance ?
But one morning -- I forget exactly the day -- but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before _that_ _evening_ , he wanted to make a memorandum in his pocket - book ; it was about spruce - beer .
Mrs . Weston , kind - hearted and musical , was particularly interested by the circumstance , and Emma could not help being amused at her perseverance in dwelling on the subject ; and having so much to ask and to say as to tone , touch , and pedal , totally unsuspicious of that wish of saying as little about it as possible , which she plainly read in the fair heroine ' s countenance .
" No -- It will not be worth while .
" Yes ," said Jane , " we heard his kind offers , we heard every thing ."
What a blessing it is , when undue influence does not survive the grave !-- He gave his consent with very little persuasion ."
" I cannot think there is any danger of it ," was Emma ' s calm answer -- " and when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax ' s situation and understand what her home has been , with Colonel and Mrs . Campbell , I have no idea that you will suppose her talents can be unknown ."
I wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it .
" No ,"-- replied Emma -- quite confirmed by the depressed manner in which he still spoke --" I should like to take another turn .
you clever creature , that ' s very true .
no .
And a delightful dance it was to be .
When you are tired of eating strawberries in the garden , there shall be cold meat in the house ."
The answer was only in this short note :
How , where , when ?-- Let me know it all .
" Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith !-- Very goodnatured , I declare ."
What is all this ?"
" If not in our dispositions ," she presently added , with a look of true sensibility , " there is a likeness in our destiny ; the destiny which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own ."
He continued ,
You are trying not to smile ."
Mr . Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his thick leather gaiters , and either the exertion of getting them together , or some other cause , brought the colour into his face , as he answered ,
Pray take care , Miss Woodhouse , ours is rather a dark staircase -- rather darker and narrower than one could wish .
At first it was downright dulness to Emma .
So afraid you might have a headache !-- seeing you pass by so often , and knowing how much trouble you must have .
It is impossible to express our surprize .
Mrs . Elton had undoubtedly the advantage , at this time , in vanity completely gratified ; for though she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill , she could not lose by the change .
I will send you some more , before they get good for nothing .'
I doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it ."
" Good morning to you ,"-- said he , rising and walking off abruptly .
He has not such a fine air and way of walking as Mr . Knightley .
" Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed ," cried Emma .
And then , her reserve -- I never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved ."
" Is not she looking well ?"
She had hardly been able to speak a word , and every look and action had shewn how deeply she was suffering from consciousness .
" A man cannot be more so ," was his short , full answer .
The evening was quiet and conversable , as Mr . Woodhouse declined cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear Isabella , and the little party made two natural divisions ; on one side he and his daughter ; on the other the two Mr . Knightleys ; their subjects totally distinct , or very rarely mixing -- and Emma only occasionally joining in one or the other .
" I think she must be here soon ," said he .
Mrs . Elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly .
" I wish we had a donkey .
Emma thought first of herself , and then of Harriet .
Henry is the eldest , he was named after me , not after his father .
A very friendly shake of the hand , a very earnest " Good - bye ," closed the speech , and the door had soon shut out Frank Churchill .
" It is too small -- wants strength .
Mrs . Weston , capital in her country - dances , was seated , and beginning an irresistible waltz ; and Frank Churchill , coming up with most becoming gallantry to Emma , had secured her hand , and led her up to the top .
" Well ," said Mrs . Weston , smiling , " you give him credit for more simple , disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do ; for while Miss Bates was speaking , a suspicion darted into my head , and I have never been able to get it out again .
In the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast , that the party to Box Hill was again under happy consideration ; and at last Donwell was settled for one day , and Box Hill for the next ,-- the weather appearing exactly right .
The decree is issued by somebody .
Mrs . Elton was spoken of .
I should be surprized if , after seeing them , you could be in company with Mr . Martin again without perceiving him to be a very inferior creature -- and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him at all agreeable before .
` Miss Woodhouse calls me the child of good fortune .'
They are very fond of being at Hartfield , Harriet ."
How could you suppose me ignorant ?
" Nay , how could I help saying what I did ?-- Nobody could have helped it .
Mr . Weston is rather an easy , cheerful - tempered man , than a man of strong feelings ; he takes things as he finds them , and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other , depending , I suspect , much more upon what is called society for his comforts , that is , upon the power of eating and drinking , and playing whist with his neighbours five times a week , than upon family affection , or any thing that home affords ."
They went in ; and while the sleek , well - tied parcels of " Men ' s Beavers " and " York Tan " were bringing down and displaying on the counter , he said --" But I beg your pardon , Miss Woodhouse , you were speaking to me , you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my _amor_ _patriae_ .
What an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream !
But then Patty came in , and said it was you .
He had caught both substance and shadow -- both fortune and affection , and was just the happy man he ought to be ; talking only of himself and his own concerns -- expecting to be congratulated -- ready to be laughed at -- and , with cordial , fearless smiles , now addressing all the young ladies of the place , to whom , a few weeks ago , he would have been more cautiously gallant .
To her he looked for comfort ; and her assurances of safety , her representation of the excellence of the horses , and of James , and of their having so many friends about them , revived him a little .
brought him yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private liking , of private understanding even , between Frank Churchill and Jane .
Miss Bates ' s powerful , argumentative mind might have strengthened yours ."
If Frank Churchill had wanted to see his father , he would have contrived it between September and January .
But now , poor girl , her peace is cut up for some time .
After a mutual silence of some minutes , Harriet thus began again --
Emma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party , and grew uncomfortable .
Now I say , my dear , in _our_ case , for _lady_ , read ---- mum !
" The clerks grow expert from habit .-- They must begin with some quickness of sight and hand , and exercise improves them .
His recollection of Harriet , and the words which clothed it , the " beautiful little friend ," suggested to her the idea of Harriet ' s succeeding her in his affections .
" No ," said Emma , laughing ; " but perhaps there might be some made to his coming back again .
I went in for three minutes , and was detained by Miss Bates ' s being absent .
Emma had hardly expected them : for Mr . Weston , who had called in for half a minute , in order to hear that his son was very handsome , knew nothing of their plans ; and it was an agreeable surprize to her , therefore , to perceive them walking up to the house together , arm in arm .
When Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wandering about the meadows , at some distance from Highbury , on the afternoon of the very day on which she had , under the plea of being unequal to any exercise , so peremptorily refused to go out with her in the carriage , she could have no doubt -- putting every thing together -- that Jane was resolved to receive no kindness from _her_ .
A very gracious invitation was returned , and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion .
Mrs . Weston added , " that he could only allow himself time to hurry to Highbury , after breakfast , and take leave of the few friends there whom he could suppose to feel any interest in him ; and that he might be expected at Hartfield very soon ."
Could I mention any thing more fit to be done , than to go to Mrs . Goddard ?
Your views for Harriet are best known to yourself ; but as you make no secret of your love of match - making , it is fair to suppose that views , and plans , and projects you have ;-- and as a friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton is the man , I think it will be all labour in vain ."
" I have not been working uninterruptedly ," he replied , " I have been assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily , it was not quite firm ; an unevenness in the floor , I believe .
He had not been at Donwell for two years .
The expense shall not be thought of ; and though he is so liberal , and so fond of Jane that I dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance , we could not suffer it to be so , you know .
Miss Woodhouse , how ungrateful I have been !"
She is always so attentive to them !"
She had no doubt of Harriet ' s happiness with any good - tempered man ; but with him , and in the home he offered , there would be the hope of more , of security , stability , and improvement .
At last , and tolerably in his usual tone , he said ,
