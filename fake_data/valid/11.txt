" A man ," said he , " must have a very good opinion of himself when he asks people to leave their own fireside , and encounter such a day as this , for the sake of coming to see him .
" Are you well , my Emma ?"
He was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever ; and , after seeing him , Emma thus moralised to herself :--
" Have I ?"
Do not you pity me ?"
-- But , said I , I shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me .--` Oh ,' said he , ` wait half a minute , till I have finished my job ;'-- For , would you believe it , Miss Woodhouse , there he is , in the most obliging manner in the world , fastening in the rivet of my mother ' s spectacles .-- The rivet came out , you know , this morning .-- So very obliging !-- For my mother had no use of her spectacles -- could not put them on .
which instantly burst forth , had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation .
Mr . Knightley to be no longer coming there for his evening comfort !-- No longer walking in at all hours , as if ever willing to change his own home for their ' s !-- How was it to be endured ?
Mr . Weston , I dare say , has been telling you exactly how the matter stands ?"
They seemed to be within half a sentence of Harriet , and her immediate feeling was to avert the subject , if possible .
Emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about Mr . Frank Churchill ' s not coming , except as a disappointment at Randalls .
Emma recollected , blushed , was sorry , but tried to laugh it off .
However , when I read on , I found it was not near so bad as I had fancied at first ; and I make so light of it now to her , that she does not think much about it .
" And when is Miss Fairfax to leave you ?"
But I thought he would have staid now , and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned .
A long time , is not it , for a cold to hang upon her ?
She believed she had been foolish , but it had alarmed her , and she had been within half a minute of sending for Mr . Perry .
He could not believe her to be encouraging him .
But never did she go without Mr . Woodhouse ' s giving a gentle sigh , and saying , " Ah , poor Miss Taylor !
I am sure he was particularly silent when Mrs . Cole told us of it at dinner ."
" I do not ask whether you are musical , Mrs . Elton .
I have no faith in Mrs . Elton ' s acknowledging herself the inferior in thought , word , or deed ; or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good - breeding .
" May I , indeed ?-- Then I will speak the truth , and nothing suits me so well .
He looked with smiling penetration ; and , on receiving no answer , added , " _She_ ought not to be angry with you , I suspect , whatever he may be .-- To that surmise , you say nothing , of course ; but confess , Emma , that you did want him to marry Harriet ."
You cannot be ignorant , Mrs . Elton , of my connexion with the family , nor of the treatment I have met with ; and , between ourselves , the whole blame of it is to be laid to her .
There she sat -- and who would have guessed how many tears she had been lately shedding ?
" And I have not forgotten ," said Emma , " how sure you were that he might have come sooner if he would .
But poor Harriet could not follow .
Miss Fairfax , who had seldom spoken before , except among her own confederates , spoke now .
" But every thing of that kind ," said Emma , " will soon be in so regular a train --"
I have nothing more to shew you , or to say -- except that I am now going to throw them both behind the fire , and I wish you to see me do it ."
" Ah !
The pain of being obliged to practise concealment towards him , was very little inferior to the pain of having made Harriet unhappy .
Did not keep the horses a moment .
She was very feverish and had a bad sore throat : Mrs . Goddard was full of care and affection , Mr . Perry was talked of , and Harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement , though she could not speak of her loss without many tears .
Miss Hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a Bristol -- merchant , of course , he must be called ; but , as the whole of the profits of his mercantile life appeared so very moderate , it was not unfair to guess the dignity of his line of trade had been very moderate also .
This , Emma could not doubt , was all for herself .
So mild and ladylike -- and with such talents !-- I assure you I think she has very extraordinary talents .
" You spent the evening with Mrs .
But on the other hand , as Emma wants to see her better informed , it will be an inducement to her to read more herself .
Not a creature knowing it but themselves -- neither the Campbells , nor her family , nor his .-- It is so wonderful , that though perfectly convinced of the fact , it is yet almost incredible to myself .
" But why should you be sorry , sir ?-- I assure you , it did the children a great deal of good ."
Every letter from her is read forty times over ; her compliments to all friends go round and round again ; and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of a stomacher , or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother , one hears of nothing else for a month .
I shall go abroad for a couple of years -- and when I return , I shall come to you for my wife .
Harriet was to sit again the next day ; and Mr . Elton , just as he ought , entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again .
Your description of Mrs . Churchill made me think of them directly .
Many counties , I believe , are called the garden of England , as well as Surry ."
You and I , Emma , will venture to take the part of the poor husband .
" The Crown !"
Knightley immediately got up , and in a manner decidedly graver than usual , said ,
Now , Mr . Knightley , a word or two more , and I have done .
An egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome .
Miss Taylor , if you had not married , you would have staid at home with me ."
Her eyes were towards Donwell as she walked , but she saw him not .
Only three of us .-- besides dear Jane at present -- and she really eats nothing -- makes such a shocking breakfast , you would be quite frightened if you saw it .
Mrs . Stokes ,' said I -- but I had not time for more ."
Exactly so , indeed -- quite unheard of -- but some ladies say any thing .
Mr . Woodhouse was resigned .
My father depends on it .
I hope you find a chair .
He told her the news .
I saw the word , and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one , and so very distressing to the other ."
For the world would not she have seemed to threaten me .-- Imagine the shock ; imagine how , till I had actually detected my own blunder , I raved at the blunders of the post .-- What was to be done ?-- One thing only .-- I must speak to my uncle .
Of course , he must be sorry to lose her -- they must be all sorry .
Are you in any doubt as to that ?
They were interrupted .
The style of the letter was much above her expectation .
Highbury , that airy , cheerful , happy - looking Highbury , would be his constant attraction ."
Two months must bring it to the proof .
" The ladies were all at home ."
" Very true ," said Harriet .
I made the match , you know , four years ago ; and to have it take place , and be proved in the right , when so many people said Mr . Weston would never marry again , may comfort me for any thing ."
As to the pretence of trying her native air , I look upon that as a mere excuse .-- In the summer it might have passed ; but what can any body ' s native air do for them in the months of January , February , and March ?
It was but an effusion of lively spirits .
" And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her !
To restrain him as much as might be , by her own manners , she was immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the weather and the night ; but scarcely had she begun , scarcely had they passed the sweep - gate and joined the other carriage , than she found her subject cut up -- her hand seized -- her attention demanded , and Mr . Elton actually making violent love to her : availing himself of the precious opportunity , declaring sentiments which must be already well known , hoping -- fearing -- adoring -- ready to die if she refused him ; but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect , and in short , very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible .
" Oh !
Emma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr . Knightley till after supper ; but , when they were all in the ballroom again , her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked .
I am quite ready .
Time , you may be sure , will make one or the other of us think differently ; and , in the meanwhile , we need not talk much on the subject ."
William did not seem to mind it himself , he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many ; for William , you know , thinks more of his master ' s profit than any thing ; but Mrs . Hodges , he said , was quite displeased at their being all sent away .
Oh !
There must be three months , at least , of deep mourning ; but when they are over , I imagine there will be nothing more to wait for ."
Certainly , delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions , Mrs . Elton .
" Do you dare to suppose me so great a blockhead , as not to know what a man is talking of ?-- What do you deserve ?"
I am sure there is nobody ' s praise that could give us so much pleasure as Miss Woodhouse ' s .
The answer was only in this short note :
Think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy ; and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it , and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of Mr . Knightley ' s marrying Jane Fairfax , or any body else , which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt .
Elton ?"
" I should hope not ; but really when I look around among my acquaintance , I tremble .
From that moment , Emma could have taken her oath that Mr . Knightley had had no concern in giving the instrument .
" Oh !
She was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or two to Mrs . Goddard ' s , but it was then to be settled that she should return to Hartfield , to make a regular visit of some days .
I will move a little farther off ."
" No -- It will not be worth while .
It was growing late , and Miss Bates became anxious to get home , on her mother ' s account .
I shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way ."
" Yes -- I _have_ called there ; passing the door , I thought it better .
" It is certainly very well regulated ."
he is off .
