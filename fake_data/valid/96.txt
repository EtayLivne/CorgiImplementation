" We should not like her so well as we do , sir , if we could suppose it ; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor ' s advantage ; she knows how very acceptable it must be , at Miss Taylor ' s time of life , to be settled in a home of her own , and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision , and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure .
I am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty , and such temper , the highest claims a woman could possess ."
It was horrible to Emma to think how it must sink him in the general opinion , to foresee the smiles , the sneers , the merriment it would prompt at his expense ; the mortification and disdain of his brother , the thousand inconveniences to himself .-- Could it be ?-- No ; it was impossible .
" And when ," thought Emma , " will there be a beginning of Mr .
Knightley was at Hartfield yesterday , and spoke of it as for Saturday ."
Emma scarcely heard what was said .-- Her mind was divided between two ideas -- her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax ; and poor Harriet ;-- and for some time she could only exclaim , and require confirmation , repeated confirmation .
And all the grandeur of the connexion seemed dependent on the elder sister , who was _very_ _well_ _married_ , to a gentleman in a _great_ _way_ , near Bristol , who kept two carriages !
" I cannot agree with you .
My brother and sister will be enchanted with this place .
said Emma , laughing .
Without his sanction I could not hope to be listened to again .-- I spoke ; circumstances were in my favour ; the late event had softened away his pride , and he was , earlier than I could have anticipated , wholly reconciled and complying ; and could say at last , poor man !
The child of good fortune !
-- repeated Frank Churchill , with a look of surprize and displeasure .-- " That is easy -- but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it , I suppose ."
" Now he has got my letter ," said she softly .
He proved to me that he could afford it ; and that being the case , I was convinced he could not do better .
One cannot wonder , one cannot wonder .
" Aye , I see what you are thinking of , the pianoforte .
What am I to do ?"
" Quite seasonable ; and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin yesterday , and prevent this day ' s party , which it might very possibly have done , for Mr . Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been much snow on the ground ; but now it is of no consequence .
Once , I felt the fire rather too much ; but then I moved back my chair a little , a very little , and it did not disturb me .
He had come , in his anxiety to see how she bore Frank Churchill ' s engagement , with no selfish view , no view at all , but of endeavouring , if she allowed him an opening , to soothe or to counsel her .-- The rest had been the work of the moment , the immediate effect of what he heard , on his feelings .
" It was short -- merely to announce -- but cheerful , exulting , of course ."
She felt herself a most fortunate woman ; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought , where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled , and who could ill bear to part with her .
The event was more favourable to Mr . Woodhouse than to Emma .
It is a beautiful moonlight night ; and so mild that I must draw back from your great fire ."
Your description of Mrs . Churchill made me think of them directly .
I like her the better for it .
" Aye , very true .-- I wish I could recollect more of it .
Though much might be fancy , he could not doubt , when he looked back , that she was in a weaker state of health than she had been half a year ago .
Heaven forbid !
I am very sure you did me good .
He hesitated , got up , walked to a window .
He must have had a wet ride .-- Yes .-- He meant to walk with her , she found .
" He ought to come ," said Emma .
She has been so kind as to promise it .
" Of all horrid things , leave - taking is the worst ."
Miss Bates , deceived by the mock ceremony of her manner , did not immediately catch her meaning ; but , when it burst on her , it could not anger , though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her .
" Now he has got my letter ," said she softly .
I was snowed up at a friend ' s house once for a week .
Do not let me lose it .
Knightley .'
I should be unwilling , I own , to live in any other part of the town ;-- there is hardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my children in : but _we_ are so remarkably airy !-- Mr .
" Mr . Knightley ," said Emma , trying to be lively , but really confused -- " I am in a very extraordinary situation .
Exactly so indeed !"
After such behaviour , as I have witnessed during the last month , to Miss Smith -- such attentions as I have been in the daily habit of observing -- to be addressing me in this manner -- this is an unsteadiness of character , indeed , which I had not supposed possible !
" And yet ," said Emma , beginning hastily and with an arch look , but soon stopping -- it was better , however , to know the worst at once -- she hurried on --" And yet , perhaps , you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is .
Thank you , my mother is remarkably well .
" There is my news :-- I thought it would interest you ," said Mr . Knightley , with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of what had passed between them .
Does Mrs . Churchill do the same ?"
she is absolutely charming !
He is an excellent young man , and will suit Harriet exactly ; it will be an ` Exactly so ,' as he says himself ; but he does sigh and languish , and study for compliments rather more than I could endure as a principal .
I think it would be much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer , and take their tea with us -- take us in their afternoon walk ; which they might do , as our hours are so reasonable , and yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening .
Mr . Elton is going to be married ."
He could not believe her to be encouraging him .
He seemed to be almost asking her , whether her affections were engaged .-- But as soon as she ( Miss Woodhouse ) appeared likely to join them , he changed the subject , and began talking about farming :-- The second , was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour before Emma came back from her visit , the very last morning of his being at Hartfield -- though , when he first came in , he had said that he could not stay five minutes -- and his having told her , during their conversation , that though he must go to London , it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all , which was much more ( as Emma felt ) than he had acknowledged to _her_ .
At first it was downright dulness to Emma .
" I see what a life I am to lead among you .
Like him , she had tried the scheme and rejected it ; but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her .
" Miss Woodhouse , as you will not give me your opinion , I must do as well as I can by myself ; and I have now quite determined , and really almost made up my mind -- to refuse Mr . Martin .
then , don ' t speak it , don ' t speak it ," she eagerly cried .
Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr . Woodhouse ' s family , less as a governess than a friend , very fond of both daughters , but particularly of Emma .
but those two lines are "--
" We cannot suppose ," said Emma , smiling , " that Mr . Elton would hesitate to assure you of there being a _very_ musical society in Highbury ; and I hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be pardoned , in consideration of the motive ."
Upon such occasions poor Mr . Woodhouses feelings were in sad warfare .
" The post - office is a wonderful establishment !"
Emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting .
but indeed I would much rather have it only in one .
The looking over his letter again , in replying to it , had such a softening tendency , that it was particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions ; and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy , and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say , and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful , that Emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment , he would have been accepted after all .
She remembered what Mr . Knightley had once said to her about Mr . Elton , the caution he had given , the conviction he had professed that Mr . Elton would never marry indiscreetly ; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his character had been there shewn than any she had reached herself .
She was stopped by a slight fit of coughing , and Mr . Weston instantly seized the opportunity of going on .
I did not see you before .
The apples themselves are the very finest sort for baking , beyond a doubt ; all from Donwell -- some of Mr . Knightley ' s most liberal supply .
said Mr . Weston , looking about .
Mr . Weston ' s sanguine temper was a blessing on all his upright and honourable exertions ; but Mr . Weston earned every present comfort before he endeavoured to gain it .-- Very true ; he did not come till Miss Fairfax was here ."
` I did not make the allowances ,' said she , ` which I ought to have done , for his temper and spirits -- his delightful spirits , and that gaiety , that playfulness of disposition , which , under any other circumstances , would , I am sure , have been as constantly bewitching to me , as they were at first .'
-- but with many , many thanks --` there was no occasion to trouble us , for Mr . Knightley ' s carriage had brought , and was to take them home again .'
When you have been here a little longer , Miss Fairfax , you will understand that Mr . Elton is the standard of perfection in Highbury , both in person and mind ."
You quite shock me ; if you mean a fling at the slave - trade , I assure you Mr . Suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition ."
" What does all that signify ?
The danger would have been of my wearying you .
He sends us a sack every year ; and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees -- I believe there is two of them .
I have no faith in Mrs . Elton ' s acknowledging herself the inferior in thought , word , or deed ; or in her being under any restraint beyond her own scanty rule of good - breeding .
Be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and the children , and let me look as I chuse ."
And I think she feels it .
There she was welcomed , with the utmost delight , by her father , who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage Lane -- turning a corner which he could never bear to think of -- and in strange hands -- a mere common coachman -- no James ; and there it seemed as if her return only were wanted to make every thing go well : for Mr . John Knightley , ashamed of his ill - humour , was now all kindness and attention ; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her father , as to seem -- if not quite ready to join him in a basin of gruel -- perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome ; and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party , except herself .-- But her mind had never been in such perturbation ; and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed her the relief of quiet reflection .
Had she left her where she ought , and where he had told her she ought !-- Had she not , with a folly which no tongue could express , prevented her marrying the unexceptionable young man who would have made her happy and respectable in the line of life to which she ought to belong -- all would have been safe ; none of this dreadful sequel would have been .
And I should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to such vanity - baits for poor young ladies ."
The Churchills might not have a word to say in return ; but then , you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through .
On his side were the inquiries ,--" Was she a horsewoman ?-- Pleasant rides ?-- Pleasant walks ?-- Had they a large neighbourhood ?-- Highbury , perhaps , afforded society enough ?-- There were several very pretty houses in and about it .-- Balls -- had they balls ?-- Was it a musical society ?"
She felt for Harriet , with pain and with contrition ; but no flight of generosity run mad , opposing all that could be probable or reasonable , entered her brain .
This event had very lately taken place ; too lately for any thing to be yet attempted by her less fortunate friend towards entering on her path of duty ; though she had now reached the age which her own judgment had fixed on for beginning .
Now , my dear madam , I will release you ; but I could not conclude before .
" You are speaking of letters of business ; mine are letters of friendship ."
She hesitated a moment , and then replied , " With you , if you will ask me ."
go to - day , go to - day .
You may have done wrong with regard to Mr . Dixon , but this is a punishment beyond what you can have merited !-- The kindness and protection of Mrs .
Jane Fairfax ' s perception seemed to accompany his ; her comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning , the superior intelligence , of those five letters so arranged .
He could say no more ; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him , returned with Mrs . Weston to Mrs . Bates ' s door .
It soon appeared that London was not the place for her .
And , my dear , whenever he comes , you had better let him look at little Bella ' s throat ."
