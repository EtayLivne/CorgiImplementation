Depend upon it he had encouragement ."
No -- till Cole alluded to my supposed attachment , it had never entered my head .
I would give any money for it .
" You had better go on ," said she .
She was rather low all the evening , but Emma could allow for her amiable regrets , and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection , sometimes by bringing forward the idea of Mr . Elton .
" They would have solicited the honour earlier , but had been waiting the arrival of a folding - screen from London , which they hoped might keep Mr . Woodhouse from any draught of air , and therefore induce him the more readily to give them the honour of his company ."
She looked up at him for a moment , coloured deeply , and played something else .
James could take the note .
" This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements , sir .
What has Mr . Frank Churchill done , to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature ?"
Miss Woodhouse , must you be going ?-- You seem but just come -- so very obliging of you ."
He was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever ; and , after seeing him , Emma thus moralised to herself :--
" Henry is a fine boy , but John is very like his mama .
The sitting began ; and Harriet , smiling and blushing , and afraid of not keeping her attitude and countenance , presented a very sweet mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist .
( with some elevation ) I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance -- of Mr . Knightley ' s coming and asking me to dance , when Mr . Elton would not stand up with me ; and when there was no other partner in the room .
By doing it , I shall feel that I am near you .
" News !
Gilbert would have danced the other evening , if she had been asked .
" Will you be so kind ," said she , " when I am missed , as to say that I am gone home ?-- I am going this moment .-- My aunt is not aware how late it is , nor how long we have been absent -- but I am sure we shall be wanted , and I am determined to go directly .-- I have said nothing about it to any body .
Yes , I see what she means , ( turning to Mr . Knightley ,) and I will try to hold my tongue .
I shall leave off while I am well ."
" Highbury gossips !-- Tiresome wretches !"
True affection only could have prompted it ."
While waiting for the carriage , she found Mr . Knightley by her side .
The naivete of Miss Smith ' s manners -- and altogether -- Oh , it is most admirable !
Where is it ?
One of those points on which his influence failed , he then mentioned .
She was soon convinced that it was not for herself she was feeling at all apprehensive or embarrassed ; it was for him .
Nobody could be so imprudent !
She had not deserved it ; she had often been negligent or perverse , slighting his advice , or even wilfully opposing him , insensible of half his merits , and quarrelling with him because he would not acknowledge her false and insolent estimate of her own -- but still , from family attachment and habit , and thorough excellence of mind , he had loved her , and watched over her from a girl , with an endeavour to improve her , and an anxiety for her doing right , which no other creature had at all shared .
I certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than I do .
It used to stand here .
At the same time , nobody could wonder if Mr . Elton should have aspired -- Miss Woodhouse lets me chatter on , so good - humouredly .
Do not let any reflection fall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought me up .
" It is so , indeed ," continued Mr . Knightley ; " I have it from Robert Martin himself .
It would be the greatest pleasure to them , if you could allow me to attend you there .
" He had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he passed -- he had not stopped , he would not stop for more than a word -- but he had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he did not call , and much as he wished to stay longer at Hartfield , he must hurry off ."
" That ' s easily said , and easily felt by you , who have always been your own master .
Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings , Mr . and Mrs . Weston ' s visit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune .
always my kindest friend on every occasion .
-- Highbury , with Mrs . Weston , stood for Hartfield ; and she trusted to its bearing the same construction with him .
" By all means , if you can ."
English verdure , English culture , English comfort , seen under a sun bright , without being oppressive .
If you do not call early it will be a slight ."
The unpersuadable point , which he did not mention , Emma guessed to be good behaviour to his father .
It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned .
She was not obliged to hear .
If it can be contrived to be at the Crown , papa , it will be very convenient for the horses .
Dear me , how clever !-- Could it really be meant for me ?"
If I had not promoted Mr . Weston ' s visits here , and given many little encouragements , and smoothed many little matters , it might not have come to any thing after all .
" I am very glad , indeed , my dear , to hear she is to be so comfortably settled .
If any thing could increase her delight , it was perceiving that the baby would soon have outgrown its first set of caps .
There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are .
If you do not call early it will be a slight ."
She was not thoroughly comfortable herself .
_Some_ _part_ of his conduct we cannot excuse ."
And that you should have been so mistaken , is amazing !-- I am sure , but for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment , I should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost , to dare to think of him .
" I am afraid ," returned Emma , sighing , " that I must often have contributed to make her unhappy ."
Apologies for her seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception , and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she was always feeling towards herself and Mr . Weston , must necessarily open the cause ; but when these effusions were put by , they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state of the engagement .
This is a point which you must settle with your feelings ."
Not that she _wanted_ him to marry .
you were perfectly right !
` Three things very dull indeed .'
Her heart beat quick on hearing Harriet ' s footstep and voice ; so , she supposed , had poor Mrs . Weston felt when _she_ was approaching Randalls .
She was in gay spirits , and would have prolonged the conversation , wanting to hear the particulars of his suspicions , every look described , and all the wheres and hows of a circumstance which highly entertained her : but his gaiety did not meet hers .
" Ah !
I think we do want a larger council .
Dixon ?"
Emma saw its artifice , and returned to her first surmises .
One man ' s style must not be the rule of another ' s .
I have already met with such success in two applications for pardon , that I may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours , and of those among your friends who have had any ground of offence .-- You must all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when I first arrived at Randalls ; you must consider me as having a secret which was to be kept at all hazards .
no .
There had been no real affection either in his language or manners .
With all the eagerness which such a transition gives , Emma resolved to be out of doors as soon as possible .
I will send you some more , before they get good for nothing .'
" Did you ever have your likeness taken , Harriet ?"
" I never had the smallest , I assure you ."
" One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of a school , Harriet .
They talked at first only of the performance .
South End is prohibited , if you please .
These letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick .
It had a most favourable aspect ; and , for half a minute , Emma felt the glory of having schemed successfully .
No invitation came amiss to her .
You need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment ."
The bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits ; and her being left in solitary grandeur , even supposing the omission to be intended as a compliment , was but poor comfort .
" You think her diffident .
Under a bright mid - day sun , at almost Midsummer , Mr . Woodhouse was safely conveyed in his carriage , with one window down , to partake of this al - fresco party ; and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the Abbey , especially prepared for him by a fire all the morning , he was happily placed , quite at his ease , ready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved , and advise every body to come and sit down , and not to heat themselves .-- Mrs . Weston , who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired , and sit all the time with him , remained , when all the others were invited or persuaded out , his patient listener and sympathiser .
Mrs . Weston , capital in her country - dances , was seated , and beginning an irresistible waltz ; and Frank Churchill , coming up with most becoming gallantry to Emma , had secured her hand , and led her up to the top .
She felt herself a most fortunate woman ; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought , where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled , and who could ill bear to part with her .
_She_ could not .
Where shall we see a better daughter , or a kinder sister , or a truer friend ?
Just as your drawings always are , my dear .
Mr . Weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment , and Mrs . Weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance ; and the interesting employment had followed , of reckoning up exactly who there would be , and portioning out the indispensable division of space to every couple .
papa , we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married .
Upon the whole , she was equally contented with her view of his feelings .
Emma made no answer , and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned , but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him very much to be gone .
I don ' t say that it is not a disagreeable business -- but things might be much worse .-- If we walk fast , we shall soon be at Randalls ."
That ' s very like .
" I think they will neither of them do the other any good ."
She had fallen into good hands , known nothing but kindness from the Campbells , and been given an excellent education .
