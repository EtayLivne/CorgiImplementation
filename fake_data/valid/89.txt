Mr . Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young farmer out of Harriet ' s head .
Five couple are nothing , when one thinks seriously about it .
I have another person ' s interest at present so much at heart , that I cannot think any longer about Frank Churchill .
Either bathing has been of the greatest service to her , or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of Mr . Wingfield ' s , which we have been applying at times ever since August ."
Her good - nature , too , is not so very slight a claim , comprehending , as it does , real , thorough sweetness of temper and manner , a very humble opinion of herself , and a great readiness to be pleased with other people .
She had frequently thought -- especially since his father ' s marriage with Miss Taylor -- that if she _were_ to marry , he was the very person to suit her in age , character and condition .
He was in high spirits ; as ready to talk and laugh as ever , and seemed delighted to speak of his former visit , and recur to old stories : and he was not without agitation .
think a farmer , ( and with all his sense and all his merit Mr . Martin is nothing more ,) a good match for my intimate friend !
" But you are always kind ."
Circumstances that might swell to half an hour ' s relation , and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them , had passed undiscerned by her who now heard them ; but the two latest occurrences to be mentioned , the two of strongest promise to Harriet , were not without some degree of witness from Emma herself .-- The first , was his walking with her apart from the others , in the lime - walk at Donwell , where they had been walking some time before Emma came , and he had taken pains ( as she was convinced ) to draw her from the rest to himself -- and at first , he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done before , in a very particular way indeed !--( Harriet could not recall it without a blush .)
Mr . Woodhouse was soon ready for his tea ; and when he had drank his tea he was quite ready to go home ; and it was as much as his three companions could do , to entertain away his notice of the lateness of the hour , before the other gentlemen appeared .
She felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant , as she viewed the respectable size and style of the building , its suitable , becoming , characteristic situation , low and sheltered -- its ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream , of which the Abbey , with all the old neglect of prospect , had scarcely a sight -- and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues , which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up .-- The house was larger than Hartfield , and totally unlike it , covering a good deal of ground , rambling and irregular , with many comfortable , and one or two handsome rooms .-- It was just what it ought to be , and it looked what it was -- and Emma felt an increasing respect for it , as the residence of a family of such true gentility , untainted in blood and understanding .-- Some faults of temper John Knightley had ; but Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably .
His coming to visit his father had been often talked of but never achieved .
One says those sort of things , of course , without any idea of a serious meaning .
" I am going to Kingston .
regular features , open countenance , with a complexion !
Mr . Woodhouse saw the letter , and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life ."
You do not know how many candidates there always are for the _first_ situations .
I am glad he can afford it .
" I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind ; but excuse me , Mr . Knightley , if I take the liberty ( I consider myself , you know , as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma ' s mother might have had ) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith ' s intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you .
It was a done thing ; Mr . Elton was to go , and never had his broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment ; never had his smile been stronger , nor his eyes more exulting than when he next looked at her .
She seems quite recovered now .
A year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at West Hall ; and how they got their fortune nobody knows .
Emma saw how Mr . Weston understood these joyous prospects .
" The ladies were all at home ."
It was growing late , and Miss Bates became anxious to get home , on her mother ' s account .
Miss Smith , pray take care .
Such a sad loss to our party to - day !"
They might advance rapidly if they would , however ; they must advance somehow or other whether they would or no .
" To fall in with each other on such an errand as this ," thought Emma ; " to meet in a charitable scheme ; this will bring a great increase of love on each side .
" _He_ is undoubtedly very much in love -- every thing denotes it -- very much in love indeed !-- and when he comes again , if his affection continue , I must be on my guard not to encourage it .-- It would be most inexcusable to do otherwise , as my own mind is quite made up .
She spoke with a confidence which staggered , with a satisfaction which silenced , Mr . Knightley .
And I need not bring the whole family , you know ."
said Emma in a whisper .
While they were thus comfortably occupied , Mr . Woodhouse was enjoying a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter .
How did you think the Coxes looked ?"
He praised her for being without art or affectation , for having simple , honest , generous , feelings .-- She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet ; he had dwelt on them to her more than once .-- Much that lived in Harriet ' s memory , many little particulars of the notice she had received from him , a look , a speech , a removal from one chair to another , a compliment implied , a preference inferred , had been unnoticed , because unsuspected , by Emma .
Even pleasure , you know , is fatiguing -- and I cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it .
I am no young lady on her preferment .
A private dance , without sitting down to supper , was pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women ; and Mrs . Weston must not speak of it again .
I will tell you exactly what I think ."
The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here , and stand very much in the same way -- just across the lawn ; and I had a glimpse of a fine large tree , with a bench round it , which put me so exactly in mind !
That ' s right .
He could not meet her in conversation , rational or playful .
CHAPTER I
It was his duty .
Heavens !
The thing would be for us all to come on donkeys , Jane , Miss Bates , and me -- and my caro sposo walking by .
No !-- she was more and more convinced that Mrs . Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise .
Here ceased the concert part of the evening , for Miss Woodhouse and Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers ; but soon ( within five minutes ) the proposal of dancing -- originating nobody exactly knew where -- was so effectually promoted by Mr . and Mrs . Cole , that every thing was rapidly clearing away , to give proper space .
She inherits her mother ' s talents , and must have been under subjection to her ."
Even you , used as you are to great sums , would hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like Jane ."
No , she had had enough of interference .
but he hoped he should in time ."
His tall , firm , upright figure , among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men , was such as Emma felt must draw every body ' s eyes ; and , excepting her own partner , there was not one among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him .-- He moved a few steps nearer , and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner , with what natural grace , he must have danced , would he but take the trouble .-- Whenever she caught his eye , she forced him to smile ; but in general he was looking grave .
" Nonsense , errant nonsense , as ever was talked !"
You know we have settled all that already .
He went to Highbury the next morning , and satisfied himself on that point .
" I do not admire it ," said Mr . Knightley .
To Miss --
She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from Mr . Elton , and now did full justice to ; and Harriet blushed and smiled , and said she had always thought Mr . Elton very agreeable .
Harriet listened , and Emma drew in peace .
No , I would not be the means of giving them any pain .
He seemed hardly to hear her ; he was thoughtful -- and in a manner which shewed him not pleased , soon afterwards said ,
The first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to attend , was the name of Jane Fairfax .
But you will do every thing right .
I should have made a good likeness of her , if she would have sat longer , but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four children that she would not be quiet .
said Emma in a whisper .
Harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude .
The event was more favourable to Mr . Woodhouse than to Emma .
Those soft blue eyes , and all those natural graces , should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its connexions .
" And here is Mrs . Weston and Mr . Frank Churchill too !-- Quite delightful ; so many friends !"
Upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright .
" So they will , my dear .
The regular and best families Emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite -- neither Donwell , nor Hartfield , nor Randalls .
Do you suppose she does not often say all this to herself ?
There is no comparison between them .
She had no doubt as to his being less in love -- but neither his agitated spirits , nor his hurrying away , seemed like a perfect cure ; and she was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her returning power , and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself with her long .
you clever creature , that ' s very true .
a great pity indeed !
A conundrum of Mr . Weston ' s shall clear him and his next neighbour .
" That is the case with us all , papa .
He listened in perfect silence .
Mr . Weston would take no denial ; they must all dine at Randalls one day ;-- even Mr . Woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of the party .
To Highbury in general it brought no material change .
But you know what I am .-- You hear nothing but truth from me .-- I have blamed you , and lectured you , and you have borne it as no other woman in England would have borne it .-- Bear with the truths I would tell you now , dearest Emma , as well as you have borne with them .
This gallant young man , who seemed to love without feeling , and to recommend himself without complaisance , directly handed over the word to Miss Fairfax , and with a particular degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it .
Some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence , with only one attempt on Emma ' s side to talk of the weather , but he made no answer .
Emma ' s only surprize was that Jane Fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate Mrs . Elton as she seemed to do .
It was her own universal good - will and contented temper which worked such wonders .
She was evidently displeased ; looked up , and seeing herself watched , blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her , and saying only , " I did not know that proper names were allowed ," pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit , and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered .
He was very much vexed .
Her present home , he could not but observe , was unfavourable to a nervous disorder :-- confined always to one room ;-- he could have wished it otherwise -- and her good aunt , though his very old friend , he must acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description .
Another song , however , was soon begged for .
" But you are always kind ."
Miss Fairfax must already have given her account .-- I shall not commit myself by claiming more than she may chuse to allow ."
This charade !-- If I had studied a twelvemonth , I could never have made any thing like it ."
" Henry is a fine boy , but John is very like his mama .
Acquit me here , and procure for me , when it is allowable , the acquittal and good wishes of that said Emma Woodhouse , whom I regard with so much brotherly affection , as to long to have her as deeply and as happily in love as myself .-- Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight , you have now a key to .
" How d ' ye do ?-- how d ' ye do ?-- We have been sitting with your father -- glad to see him so well .
